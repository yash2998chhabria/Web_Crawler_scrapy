Sarah,"I have always been a worrier. I can look back on my childhood now at the age of 24, and recognise the signs of anxiety developing.,My stressful ways developed into anxiety around four years ago. I wasn’t lucky enough to have kept any close friends from my schooling days, and went into a reckless phase after high school, developing friendships with people who I was better off away from. ,When I decided it was time to leave this phase, and all the people involved in it behind, I was left virtually friendless. ,I put all my physical energy into working full time (which meant having two jobs), whilst completing my full time university degree. This meant working seven days a week, and completing university assignments after finishing 12 hour shifts.,You may ask why I put myself through this, well I had a lust to travel, as well as an incredible partner who I couldn’t bare seeing the world without. So I took on the financial burden of paying for him to come with me on these holidays, as he wasn’t in the position to pay for himself. ,When I meet people one of the first things they mention to me is the number of overseas holidays my partner and I have been on. Yes, we have been especially fortunate to travel around the world, but what most people don’t understand is that travel was my escape. It gave me something to look forward to, and something to get me through the long days of being miserable in my life. When I was on a plane and it took off, this meant I could escape the life I hated so much for a short period of time. ,In order to work these extreme hours I gave up every aspect of my social life and wellbeing. This meant I had a very small group of people I interacted with, none of whom were females my own age. I ate terribly and never exercised, resulting in weight gain, as I was simply too exhausted to cook or go to the gym after work. Every cent of my wage went into paying for two people to go on numerous overseas holidays, so I was never able to indulge in anything in my day to day life.,This pattern kept up for well over two years, from which I developed horrific social anxiety. ,My experience of dealing with social anxiety is a feeling of overwhelming fear when interacting with individuals I wasn’t comfortable with. I was unable to look people in the eye when speaking to them, and struggled to keep a conversation going. I came off as both extremely quiet and shy, as well as rude, which anyone who knows me well knows I am the opposite of. ,During this period of my life my self-confidence was at an all-time low, and I felt disgusted every time I looked in the mirror. I stayed away from people as much as I could, and felt I made an embarrassment of myself whenever I went out in public. I constantly had a voice in my head saying “Why would anyone want to be friends with you? You are ugly and pathetic.” ,Things turned around when my partner finished his apprenticeship, and was lucky enough to get a well-paying job. This meant for the first time in our relationship I no longer held the financial burden. For the first time in over three years I was able to spend money on things which seem so trivial but play a huge role in our self-confidence, such as getting my hair done and buying some new clothes. I also cut back on my ridiculous work schedule. ,I’m happy to say now that a year on things have improved tremendously. ,Would I say my life is perfect and I am happy every day? No. But do I still have that feeling that I am dying on the inside? Not in the slightest. ,I did small things, which made such a huge change to my life. Such as joining a netball team, regularly going to the gym, and pushing myself to interact socially whenever I was given the opportunity. I still struggle in social situations, but nowhere near to the extent in which I did. Most importantly, I have a partner who has stayed by my side, through all the anxiety attacks and sleepless crying nights, whilst loving me unconditionally, when I was an extremely hard person to love. ,I recently started a job which I thought was going to be the beginning of my career. However, things are not always perfect and I realised this job was causing my anxiety to reappear. I was going back down the path to the dark place I had been for so long. I can say that for the first time in my life I put my mental health first and quit this job. It took me too long to crawl out of that pitch black, horrific place and I do not intend to ever return. ,I understand my story may be nothing compared to what some people face, but if even one person relates it was worth writing.,So if you are out there, I promise things will get better. Just keep pushing on, one day at a time. "
Russell,"Nick died tragically early in January 2015. He was 22 years of age. Nick was part of the usual less than perfect family; with brothers, cousins, aunts, uncles, grandparents, friends and various others who loved and confused him with equal measure. As a child Nick was diagnosed as having ADHD and later this was clarified as Asperger's syndrome. ,This meant that Nick's experience of the world was more confusing than for most of us, as the analytical stream of his brain and the emotional stream were less interconnected. He was to experience learning difficulties, his parents' divorce, his mother dying much too soon, having to take what work might be offered and various tribulations of life. ,My son Nick had a powerful memory. Before he started school he could name each of the Thomas-The-Tank-Engines: James, Gordon, Annie and Clarabel, Percy, Toby, Henry and many others. As an adolescent Nick mastered catching after back-flipping at trapeze, having no fear of heights. He had abundant patience, which he drew on when working as a personal care attendant. Nick enjoyed drawing, as did his grandfather and great-grandfather who shared a family curse of depression; Japanese anime was his preferred style. Nick could be maddening to live with; he might tidy up but not completely, staying up late and expressing decided opinions.  ,Only a few months before his death, Nick sought medical advice. He took the prescription medication he was prescribed. He accepted a referral to a clinical psychologist and did not miss any appointments. We cannot know what was in Nick's mind on the evening he died and why he so hastened into this good night. His family has earnestly reflected on how we might have better supported Nick. Nick is buried with his mother. Breichiau mam sy'n dynn amdanat (Mother's arms are tight around you).  "
Chris ,"I am a 54 year old male and I have suffered from depression since my teens and was in active alcohol addiction from the age of 15 until I was 51. I have now been sober for over 31 months. I was a civil engineer for over 30 years, but lost my job on medical grounds in 2014 whilst I was in rehab. In addition to the clinical depression, upon completing the rehab programme, I learnt that I needed both of my hips replaced due to osteoarthritis.,The surgeries were carried out last year. On the weekend of 5-6 March 2016, I completed the CBR100 Challenge (a 100km walk around Canberra) in 27 hours 26 min. This was the first of a series of events that I am planning to do this year to raise funds for Beyond Blue, which may include the Canberra Times 10km run in September and the Sydney to the Gong Bike a Ride in November.,I have created a group which is aimed at getting persons with lived experience (or their carers) involved in exercise. I have found that exercise has been my default recovery mechanism since my teens and was important during my time in rehab.,I am a consumer representative on three committees and involved in a local Health Consumer Network. I have recently completed a Cert IV in Mental Health/Drug & Alcohol studies. I am currently studying for a Cert IV in Fitness and hope to take personal training into rehab centres to help facilitate recovery. I intend to then study for a Diploma in either Drug & Alcohol or Mental Health Studies and (hopefully) a degree in psychology, but I need a job first! I currently receive salary continuance insurance but I am very fearful of returning to the workforce and suffering a relapse and losing all income! My hope is to get work in a rehab facility and to use my fitness training experience to facilitate recovery. I recently completed workplace experience in a mental health service and exercise played a major role in their programme.,I hope that by sharing my story, I can show that there is hope and that it is possible to achieve amazing things, even when living with depression."
Isabelle,"How easy do you think it is to be happy? Can we simply choose to be happy?  What happens when big life events happen? These events could be being bullied or someone you love being sick or dying or.....and this is the BIG one.....Donald Trump becoming president.                                     ,So what are some things that can go wrong with mental health?  Imagine waking up every day feeling like you can't live with yourself. Picture having no motivation or interest in anything. This is the reality for too many.                    ,According to the White Cloud foundation currently over 3 million Australians suffer from mental illness. 10,000 of these are young people.                                               ,The World Health organisation reports that over 350 million people suffer from depression. This is a more than serious issue. I am your youth, here is my voice and it is up to us to educate ourselves, protect ourselves and support others.        ,I feel passionately about this subject. My cousin Lisa suffered from mental illness that started when she was my age. She fought her depression every day for 8 years. She looked after herself, she exercised, she sought medical treatment.           ,She battled long and hard on a quest to be at peace with herself and to be well. Unfortunately when she was 20 Lisa could fight no longer and she took her life.        ,As I get older and see more things I think about how brave she was and how desperate she was. It makes me want to scream and yell.                                                ,My well-loved uncle Glenn was Lisa's father. After she had taken her life he couldn't live with her loss and the fact that he couldn't help her and he too ended his life a year ago. ,I was 10 when that happened and it had more of an impact on me as I was older and I loved him. I felt like he was pretty quiet and I didn't get to know him as I wanted to. Depression is a thief it robbed me of him.        ,Both my cousin and uncle were young, had families that loved them, had all the support in the world and had so much to live for. They and so many others see no other way out.   ,However, my voice is here to say that for anyone out there who suffers with a mental illness that this doesn't have to be the outcome. Is there hope? Absolutely! Does sadness mean you are going to die?  Of course not! There is help out there and help has been given to many.                 ,It might be a long journey but remember it never should end that way. The impacts on those left behind are huge.      ,There are lots of organisations such as Beyond Blue, The Black Dog Institute and Suicide Prevention Australia. That have a lot of tools to help you.                         , We need to tackle this problem early and often. ,Grown-ups….I beg you to educate yourselves. No family is immune. It doesn’t always happen to other people. We can't run away from this problem. We need to face it head on. ,I wanted to talk to you about this topic today because it is very dear to my heart. I don't want the same thing to happen to your family as what's happened to mine.     ,Once it is done it is done. You are special, you are unique, you cannot be replaced. Join me in the fight to look after our mental health and stop suicide. And finally, in the words of Donald Trump. ‘Depression!....You're fired.’           "
Katrina,"There are seminal moments, defining moments in life. And when they occur life is defined by them - what life was before that moment, what life was after that moment. ,My sons suicide on the 20/3/2012 was my defining moment. That fateful day forever changed my life.  After his death I was in shock  and drowning in grief and despair. I descended into depression and suffered post traumatic shock. My family could not deal with my grief and mental issues and withdrew from me. I was alone in my despair. I lost my joy  and security. I felt there was no hope and everyone would be better off without me. I wanted to take my own life.,Thankfully I reached out to professionals and the TCF. This group gave me hope and valuable guidance. I saw psychologists, bereavement counsellors and started medication. ,I found focus in my sons legacy, saving lives and making a difference, giving mental health presentations in schools. I still carry my pain  but  have learned to live around it.  ,This poem says it all; ""I will be your legacy, I will be your voice. You live on in me, so I have made a choice. To honour your life by living again. I love you, I miss you, I will see you again."""
Bill,"I have been affected by depression and anxiety for around twenty years. That was when I suffered a total mental breakdown and lost everything I had including my wife, my children, my business and my mind. I ended up in a caravan park where I was “living on the gutters edge”.  I would hide inside the van for most of the day being too afraid to go outside in case I had to talk to people. My brain simply stopped working. I couldn’t even get it together to make a cup of cup of coffee let alone make a meal.  It was so bad I hated waking up in the morning and often wished that I hadn’t.  ,I constantly had emotions of anxiety, fear, guilt, sadness and terror welling up from inside of me. It was the gut wrenching feeling from my stomach and ache in my heart I dreaded the most. Many times I thought about committing suicide and tried to figure out ways to do it.  On a day when it was really bad, I was seriously considering it when the phone rang and the voice simply said, “How are your going?”  “Terrible” I replied – and I’m sure the person could hear the despair in my voice.  “Where are you?” he said – “Stay there, don’t go anywhere else”.  ,About ten minutes later, there was a knock on the caravan door. I went to open it and there was a stranger standing there. “Can I come in?” was all he said. That man simply talked to me about his life and what had happened for him. He told me how it took a long time to overcome his problem step-by-step and having faith and the belief that he would some day become well. I could see the similarities in my life and began to accept myself as being one of the many people that suffers from a mental condition. The stranger inspired me in two ways. Firstly, that if he could re-build his life it was proof that I could also get my life back together again. Secondly and more important, was that this man valued me sufficiently enough for him to leave work and come to see me. ,This meant I must have been of some value to another person and I didn’t have the right to end my life. And it doesn’t stop there. People suffering from mental conditions need support and encouragement to keep working on themselves. I’ve been using pressure points on myself to make the feelings of depression go away within a few minutes and I no longer have thoughts of suicide. "
Bianca,"It's a long story but it does have a happy ending. I've never shared it before but I'm ready to now. ,Anxiety for me came out of nowhere and hit me like a ton of bricks. It just started with a jitteriness and loss of appetite, constantly sweaty palms and an elevated heart rate I could feel. I started throwing up in the morning at the thought of going to work. I didn't know about anxiety then and when I tried to explain it I would say I was a bit sick. My work was a pretty high pressure sales job and sick days weren't really a thing so I just got on with it.  ,I was losing weight fast too, but I had some weight to lose so I wasn't worried. ,Then the panic attacks started. For me everything centred around my heart. It would beat super-fast without any trigger and that alone would scare me into a nasty cycle. ,The second time it happened I was scared and I called an ambulance. They took me to the ER as my heart was at 180bpm resting and that was the first time I encountered something I think is a massive problem...  I don't even know with what, society, body image, medical attitude whatever. I saw the ER doctor who dismissed my concerns and I was sent home. ,The anxiety got worse, now I was terrified of another panic attack. Within a week I quit my job, too scared I'd have another attack while driving. (This was to be the only period I was unemployed since I was old enough to work until I went into labour with my little boy) so I lost the independence driving allows too. I lost another 10kg. My family were whispering about eating disorders. I overheard my husband telling them ""she's throwing up again"" my parents neighbour approached me to tell me I was worrying them and they'd told him they ""just couldn't get me to eat."" ,I went to my GP. The first thing he told me was how great I looked. I was by this point underweight. I told him what had been happening and how I felt and he said ""but you look so good, you look like a supermodel"" again I was apparently being ungrateful for the ‘gift’ I'd been given. ,After some pressure from my husband he took some blood and sent me on my way. He later called to tell me I didn't seem dangerously malnourished and my thyroid function was fine and I should take some vitamins. Still nobody had mentioned anxiety, I felt like some kind of fraud because I wasn't malnourished must mean I was exaggerating not being able to eat. I was broken. I thought that was it. I was just going to feel like this forever.  ,My uncle said he knew a doctor that would at least ""give me something for it"" and he took me there. He was right. The doctor didn't say much, it was pretty clear he thought I was drug seeking but he was OK with that so he gave me medication and sent me on my way. They didn't do very much. I never remember feeling normal again while I took them. ,I lost more weight and people were making comments about how my bones stuck out and I'd gone too far. People would stare and make comments to each other if I was ever out and I get why. I looked like a junky. My hair was thin, my bones stuck out through my clothes, I had dark stressed eyes and I was jittery. This had been going on for around six months now and by now it had taken my independence, my career, my health and a lot of my friendships. ,Then one night I decided to drink some wine and I got a bit drunk and for the first time I actually felt relaxed. It was so good that the next day I had some more and it worked again and again and again. What followed was a downward spiral that would last about three years. During that time my marriage ended and so did most of my relationships. No one had signed up for this. I was an absolute mess making one bad choice after another. ,I finally went to a walk-in GP to try and get help for my drinking problem and was finally put into therapy. That is where I learnt about anxiety and panic attacks and managed to break my dependence on alcohol. I also got the coping techniques to get my anxiety under control naturally. ,That all happened almost 10 years ago and my life now is blessed with a very good man and a beautiful boy. I got some of my old friendships back on track and I made some new ones. For where I am now I'm thankful my life took me here but no one should have to go through all that. Most of it didn't need to happen and I still don't trust doctors even now. ,Anyway if you've made it this far thank you for taking the time to let me tell you my story. I'm sure it's not unique but it is mine and I've never told it before so thank you. "
Steph,"I have two black dogs. Sometimes I only have one. But once I see him, I know the other one will shortly follow. I don’t always have the black dogs with me. Some days I feel completely weightless, like I’m not carrying a burden. I’m so used to the black dogs being around. I feel guilty not having them. I worry if they are not with me they are with someone else. But when they are there I want them to leave. I wish they would die and never return. But they can not be killed. ,The black dogs names are depression and anxiety. You never know when they are going to come back to their master. Although I am their master I have no control over them. They are constantly barking. Confusing me. I can’t think with them barking so loudly. The shame of owning these black dogs is real. You feel like they are a sign of weakness. You don’t want anyone knowing you have these black dogs. Especially dogs you can’t control. When you see friends, you put the music on loud, so they can’t hear the black dogs. You pull the curtain so they can’t see the black dogs. You’re so busy worrying about people seeing the black dogs, so worried the black dogs will escape and bite someone that you give up trying. You isolate yourself, wanting to be alone with them. ,The dogs soon take over everything in your life. They take up all your time.  People who come over, you push away because you don’t want them to see the real side of you, the pain and shame you are feeling. If people see the dogs get defensive. You reassure people that “that they are OK” and “I have them trained and under control”. But you (alone) can never get control over them.  ,All the things you used to enjoy are now pointless. The dogs distract you and ruin everything surrounding you. You don’t want anyone to be affect by you having the dogs. This is why you hide. When you finally admit to yourself that you need to get a trainer to help train the black dogs, they leave. You think the worst is over. They won’t come back.  But (for me) they always come back. They can come back at any time and who knows, the dogs maybe bigger and more viscous next time. ,Some days I just want to end it all, I have tried once, but luckily it was unsuccessful. I just want to have a day without the black dogs, or a day when I can fully control them. I am glad I am now getting help, because everyday it is getting better, and I am beginning to see a light at the end of the tunnel.  "
Dan,"The Father I Knew,And the guy I wish I had known longer,The Summer of 1993 saw me driving down the freeway with my Dad, listening to MeatLoaf’s Bat Out Of Hell. Loud. “Listen to the motorbikes, mate, they have those live on stage when he performs.” The idea that someone would allow motorbikes to be ridden around on a concert stage seemed ridiculous to me even then, but if anyone would do it, I was sure it would be MeatLoaf.,We were on the highway on our way to Mini Golf. It was my first time playing, and I took to it with a particular vigour that continues to this day. That vigour is a mixture of excitement, frustration and a particular lack of hand-eye coordination. Dad would coach me, always patiently. It wasn’t until his funeral that I discovered my sporting skills were directly inherited from him.,I refer to those days as the MeatLoaf days, as that was the soundtrack to my relationship with him. I now know that he loved Dire Straits, but back then it was MeatLoaf. We listened to that album each time we got in the car. We would go to the beach, where he taught me how to bodyboard; we would go to the movies, where he showed me my first M15+ rated movie when I was five (Waterworld, the Kevin Costner classic); we would go the aforementioned Mini Golf; every Saturday, I knew that I would see him from 11am-4pm, without fail.,The day he showed me Terminator II and RoboCop, I fell in love with Action films. The days we spent playing Indy500 (always needing to enter the corresponding answer from the booklet to the question on the load screen –piracy has come quite a way). Our adventures side-by-side waging war through the levels of Doom, Wolfenstein and Commander Keen, two mates loving each other’s company.,Mum and Dad had split up when I was six months old, making it difficult for me to remember a lot of time growing up with him. I saw him from the bus once, on my way to primary school. I banged and banged and banged on the window calling out to him, but he couldn’t hear me. I was devastated.,He spoke about his family often, being one of five, the middle child and the only boy. He would update me on what they and their families were up to, who was pregnant and how my cousins were.,I was lucky at primary school. I was looked after each school day by friends mother (some would call it babysat). She was a kind and gentle person, teaching me how to tie my shoelaces and the wondrous power of the aloe vera plant on burns. She was also a single mother looking after her only son. I think because of this, it never really dawned on me that what Mum and I had experienced was that strange. By this time, Mum had married my stepdad, my sister had been born, and we were a family unit. I still saw Dad every Saturday from 11am-4pm though, and I looked forward to it all week.,It’s difficult to define the relationship that I had with Dad, now that it has been so many years. He taught me how to play cricket — oddly, I am left handed for batting, but right handed for bowling, writing, playing tennis… he didn’t even blink, he just said that I should go with whatever felt was the most comfortable and whatever gave me the most control. We watched the cricket together in his lounge room, the sea breeze always coming in through the open double doors, while we looked north along the coast. Life could not be better.,Each year he wrote to Santa and specifically had him visit us two nights before Christmas. He really was a great Dad.,Unfortunately, he fell from his second floor balcony in 1994. Seeing him in hospital sucked. His trademark moustache was now accompanied by three-day stubble. He was , very precise with his appearance; lying there he didn’t resemble himself at all.,He was the light of any room, telling his stories with a smile and and a chuckle. The neck brace didn’t let him do that. What the doctors diagnosed was filtered down to me through Mum and my stepdad. He’s had a bad fall, his brain has moved, and as a result his personality may have changed. He will always love you though.,I’m not sure that’s entirely what happened (and I have heard varying recollections/interpretations of that day), however I do know that he left the hospital with a little less light in his eyes.,All of a sudden we were moving. Dad came to visit a few times, which was great, but our Saturdays were no more. It was too far and too hard to see him often.,He’s moods grew darker, our interactions tinged with the kind of pressure an 8 year old can’t understand, let alone respond to.,Father’s Day 1988 was the last time I spoke with him. We had gone out for breakfast with my stepdad. Unfortunately, Dad had to be at a coal mine for work by lunchtime and it was a four-hour drive from his house. By the time I called, he had left.,When the phone rang that evening, I knew it would be him. I raced to the phone and answered it, expecting to hear his familiar voice and smile down the line. But it wasn’t. It was angry. And loud. He shouted so much. I had to pass the phone to Mum, speechless. What just happened? In turn Mum, equally wordless, passed the phone to my stepdad. She hugged me and told me she loved me.,Once the phone had been placed back on the hook, there was a lot of confusion, anger, numbness.,As I didn’t see another phone call working, I wrote a letter by hand (read: 8 year old scrawl). I told him that I loved him, that I was sorry I hadn’t called him in time on Father’s Day, but that neither my Mum nor I would not be spoken to that way. I sent it. It was the stupidest letter I have, or will ever, send.,My Dad committed suicide three years later, on the 25th October, 2001. He was incredibly proud, he was the life of the party and he meant the world to so many people. But he didn’t know how to ask for help, and he didn’t know how to accept help.,I have been lucky enough to inherit a lot of Dad’s gifts. But the most important lesson I have learnt from him is:,Never be too proud to reach out and ask for a hand. It will change your life."
Michael,"As far back as I can remember, I have been a quiet, nervous kid. It’s not too hard to imagine, because I’m a pretty quiet, nervous twenty-five-year-old too. One who can be painfully shy, more than a little awkward, and who frets about things both real and imagined.,I’m scared of disappointing people, of being rude, and of being disliked. The irony of it being hard to be well-liked when you’re too scared to talk to someone is not lost on me either. Whether it’s meeting people for the first time, trying something new, or being put into an uncomfortable situation - for as long as I can remember these situations make me tense up, retreat into myself, and wish for it to all be over.,It first began spiralling out of control throughout those dreaded high school years. Fears of being hit by a football when I walked across the oval to class every day, or getting laughed at for saying something wrong in class, made me hyper aware of anything that could make me look like an idiot (and heaven forbid, make me stand out of the crowd).,When you’re desperate to remain invisible, you begin to think that anything that could go wrong, will go wrong. It wasn’t until after leaving school, that I realised that these fears hadn’t subsided.,It wasn’t just the kids at school whose opinions I feared, and who I didn’t want to look like a fool in front of, it was the wider world, a world which I was now a part of.,When I was much older I was able to pin down exactly what was going on in my mind, and why these things made me feel the way I did – I had anxiety.,Once I realised exactly what was going on with my mind, and could put a label on it, I began opening up to my friends and family about how I was feeling.,It wasn’t a sob story, or even a plea for help, in fact, once I was able to open up about it, the first instinct was to share a laugh about it.,By talking about the different situations I get anxious in, and shouting ‘riddikulous’ at them, I hoped to be able to turn them from something scary, into something I’m able to laugh about. (Shout-out to the Harry Potter fans who get this metaphor).,I can acknowledge that more often than not it is utterly ridiculous the things I worry about, but the wrong mindset can trigger a molehill into a mountain.,When fears are more than just funny anecdotes, they can change your way of life and limit how you engage with the world. They stop you being the , you, and make you second guess every single choice you make, and every situation you find yourself in.,It can be the hardest thing to do, but standing up and saying that you deserve better than this is the first step to helping yourself. There’s no shame in admitting that you don’t want this kind of life for yourself, and that you need to talk to someone – whether a professional or a friend – to work through it.,We can get weighed down in the monotony of the day-to-day, or held back by the negativity, that we can forget that we only get one shot at this life, and to reel ourselves back from living it to the full is only doing ourselves a disservice.,It can seem more comfortable withdrawing from life to avoid these fears, but when we reach the end of our time, are we going to remember the peace of mind we had each time we avoided uncomfortable situations, or are we going to remember the time we met our fears head-on and had a blast as a result.,With the resources and help we have available, living in these fears doesn’t have to be a reality. There’s a whole wide world out there for the taking, and we’re the only ones stopping ourselves from truly enjoying it.,Feeling a little overwhelmed? ,
Ready to shed your fears and live your real life?,Let’s do this together."
