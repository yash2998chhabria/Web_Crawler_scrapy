"Edwin, ","Before I was diagnosed with depression, anxiety and severe ADHD, I was quite oblivious to mental health issues. Since then, I have gained a much deeper insight on how society views and deals with these issues. I have also come to realise how my words effect the way people interact with me, and how they view me as a person. Words are powerful. Which is why I have said publicly, “when I keep quiet, stigma wins – and I can’t let that happen”.,Stigma is something I have had to deal with on an almost daily basis – especially in the workplace. Over time, you learn to deal with it, but the scars stay with you. They act as a reminder that the stigma attached to mental illness is real.,I would say the biggest drivers of stigma in my country are a lack of awareness / information and harmful stereotypes. In Kenya, common misconceptions include ideas that people with mental health issues cannot recover, that people with mental health issues are violent, that we are incompetent and that we are to blame for our illness.,There are many negative economic and social ramifications attached to having mental health conditions – which can serve to further add to the stigma.,I am naturally a very vocal person. Before becoming a Champion with this global anti-stigma programme, I had spoken out about mental health on social media and I had also taken part in mental health advocacy.,However, now, I am part of a group of Champions who are challenging stigma on mental health issues. It feels like being in a big family that understands you – during bad times and good.,What is even more encouraging is the knowledge that in other countries the same thing is happening. I had the chance to meet with Champions from Ghana, India, Nigeria and Uganda. This event in my home city of Nairobi brought together five different cultures and languages, but the most inspiring thing was that we all found a common language, the language of anti-stigma.,This language knows no race, religion, gender, creed, or political allegiance. This common drive to end mental health stigma, bound us together as Champions and friends. We are moving forwards together to change the world.,For everyone reading this toolkit, I hope you can share this common language too. I think one thing we all need to embrace is that learning never stops. Amazing work is happening around the world to end mental health stigma.,Exchanging ideas and sharing the challenges faced in different countries will make all our work stronger.,The one thing I would love everyone reading this to know is this: Stigma hates conversations that challenge its’ existence. So, let us start having raw and candid conversations about mental health conditions and the stigma we are facing.,When we all start to do this, we will see a world where people with mental health problems are treated as human beings.,---, "
"Candice, ","Growing up in my household was a bit of a struggle. Around the age of 12, I was bullied quite severely, which in turn had an impact on my mental health. I began to experience symptoms of anxiety and depression. I was always a reserved, quiet person but I built up the courage to talk to my mum about how I was feeling.,I went into the kitchen to talk about being bullied and how it made me feel. I was expecting some understanding and comfort but that is not what I received. To this day, I remember exactly what she said to me, ""You're too young to be depressed. What do you have to be depressed about?”,The response made me feel like my feelings did not matter as I was ‘young’ and had not experienced life yet. At times, I believe that I was not taken seriously due to my age. I was young, so perhaps my mum believed what I was feeling at the time was temporary. I felt sad for some time as I hoped that I could at least talk to my mum and get some encouragement. The topic wasn’t discussed for some time and I was always the one to bring it up.,As my mum didn’t understand me and how I was feeling, I turned to my cousin who understood my feelings completely. I expressed how my mother’s response made me feel and she assured me that her response is ‘typical’ of the older, west Indian generation. Mental health is somewhat of a taboo topic within West Indian culture; some people with mental health disorders are often referred to as ‘crazy’ with little acknowledgement of what the person may be facing.,Not only was discussing feelings and topics that are sensitive in nature rarely discussed, when it was eventually brought up, most of the time the topic was dismissed or the issue was minimised.,If I could turn back time, I wish my mother reassured me and comforted me insisting that what I was feeling was valid regardless of my age. Depression and anxiety can affect all ages regardless of creed, religion, or colour. I wished that she was able to understand that symptoms of depression and anxiety can overlap, life experience can create these symptoms and that you can’t just pray mental health conditions away.,I tried countless times to talk to my mother about it, but she told me repeatedly to just ‘pray about it’. I took her advice, but it did not help me. I guess that was the best advice she could offer and that may have been taught to her.,For those who have a loved one who may be struggling with their mental health, reassure them that you are there to support them. Providing an individual who may be struggling with their mental health with a support system can have a positive impact on their wellbeing. Be cautious when you talk to them and don’t force them to talk to you about issues they may be facing. If you provide a safe space for them, they may be willing to talk to you in their own time. If they do decide to confide in you, please be mindful with your responses. Listen to understand and try not to judge them.,Everyone has a different way of dealing and coping with issues that they may be struggling with. My family doesn’t always understand me, but I am ok with that. Going to therapy has taught me that I am only responsible for me and no one else. Some people may underestimate how much mental health has an impact on our day to day lives.,I aim to try and talk about mental health more often with my family regardless of the response I get. Now, my mum has become more open with regards to discussing mental health which I am happy about. We are all just taking it one day at a time and counting our blessings in the process."
"Lauren, ","I can almost set my clock by it. Seasonal affective disorder, or SAD,  is a sneaky illness, at least in my experience. I’ve had this leafy, dark cloak in my closet for about seven years now. It comes out only from about mid-October and gets shoved away at the end of February, and weighs heavily on my back.,As I’ve got older, the intensity of my symptoms has increased. I’m still without a diagnosis, but I feel I haven’t got the energy I need to fight to prove that there is a real pattern to having depression as the weather deteriorates into dark mornings and dark nights that seem to be endless, with rain falling and sunlight in scarce supply.,I find SAD really difficult to explain to others that have never had it or any other mental illness, because we all experience things differently.,2020 is the first year I have really spoken this openly about my SAD, as previously I was afraid to mention having my mental health affected by the seasons changing, that others just think it would be an excuse for being grumpy, or in ‘one of those moods’.,To finally stop all the self-stigmatising, to stop all of the behaviour that must look really odd to my work colleagues and friends, like making a strange excuse to rush outside for some precious vitamin D in a freezing wind with a winter sun.,Seasonal affective disorder is real, and can be a serious issue. January tends to be the worst time of year for me, as it gets colder, it’s still dark a lot of the time which is reflected within my mood. It isn’t only the feeling low in mood, it’s having a short fuse, sleeping problems, it’s the feeling of ‘do I really have to face the day again?’ on some mornings, opening the curtains to dark grey skies and heavy rain with an instant inner sigh. It’s the lacking in motivation, the knowing that no matter what you say, someone won’t ‘get’ it and will somehow find it funny or wind you up. It’s happened too many times where I’ve snapped at someone and instantly regretted it, or burst into tears over a single comment.,The additional anxiety that comes alongside it is quite debilitating too, making my existing social anxiety and generalised anxiety disorder worsen, but this is almost invisible to most.,There are things that I have found incredibly helpful though. Medication, though it doesn’t work for everyone, including vitamin D supplements, really helps maintain my mood at a manageable level. I invested in a special SAD specific lightbox, which has made a tremendous difference – the light produced by the light box simulates the sunlight that's missing during the darker winter months, and I use it while having breakfast for around 10 minutes a day, which has had a dramatic effect!,I also have found that listening to my favourite music helps a lot, and so does writing, either creatively or in poetry – getting how I feel down on paper is really good for my mood sometimes. I go walking in nearby nature spots or parks, or even just around the block for 20 minutes, and combine this with my other passion of photography, and find it really calming and uplifting to listen to the world around me, although some day I have to almost force myself outside for a walk because I know if I don’t then I’ll feel a lot worse for not doing so. Having someone to talk to that doesn’t try and fix you is incredible, or even one that just listens to you."
"Dan, ","My story? Well, I only realised that I had symptoms of clinical depression recently. And probably that I've had it a lot longer than I thought.,I was always of the belief that depression was a result of a traumatic event, a loss, stress, unhappiness at home, being bullied, those types of things. But it turns out you can just have bad brain chemistry. My brain just doesn't produce enough serotonin.,It dawned on me that I no longer enjoyed the things I used to love. I couldn't remember the last time I laughed. And I mean the belly-cramping, nose-snorting kind. Reading, drawing, playing games, and going for walks didn't make me feel the way they used to. It was starting to affect my work, and I showed little interest or put any effort into my relationship of 9 years.,This was the person that I had spent 3 and a half years travelling the world with. The person who I had bought my first home with. We were doggy parents to a beautiful German Pointer puppy now, and I showed no interest or enthusiasm for making lasting memories or a lovely home together. I just existed. Going through the motions day after day until oblivion. Even though I was always there, she must have felt so alone.,That's not living, that's wasting time.,All through my teenage years, my 20's and most of my 30's I've always been told that I'm so laid back, relaxed and nothing ever bothers me. I always believed that these were good personality traits. Ever agreeable, 'happy' to go with the flow and always aiming to please.,But there were other signs as well. I never had much drive or motivation to do well academically. I often felt worthless, tired, hopeless, and anxious.,I dismissed the notion of it being depression, as I had no reason to be sad.,I had a great childhood with loving parents. I'd found my soulmate and now owned a house in a beautiful part of the country. I had a good job with good people. And I was healthy, and so was everyone important to me.,So why was I feeling like this?,I decided to seek help about a year ago now. My depression had reached a point where I just wanted to vanish into a puff of smoke. Everything, every task, every email, every small job felt like an absolute chore.,So, as silly as I thought I was being, I went to see my doctor. And even before finishing my first sentence I completely broke down. It all came out and as bad as I felt, it was a relief to finally tell someone how I was feeling. That first conversation was a hugely important first step to a happier me.,It’s been a long road. I'm not going to lie and say that the medication (Sertraline aka Zoloft) cured me overnight. I still feel down, tired and some days are still a struggle. But I'm a lot better. My relationship is healthy again, I'm focused at work and enjoying life a little more each day. She’s been very supportive and now understands why there are some days when I don’t want to talk or do anything. Aspects of my behaviour that used to be annoying now have an explanation.,And this made a big difference to me too. Whereas previously I felt like I had to thrust “happy” me to the forefront every day, I no longer needed to. This only drains you further in the long term, and the cracks will start to show. For me, this mostly manifested itself as irritability. I had no patience for anyone or anything and I’d snap and backchat at even the most trivial things.,I’ve always had a very close relationship with my brother and sister. They’re two of my best friends. Furthermore, my older brother has suffered from depression for some years now. So talking to him about how he was feeling and what he did about it helped me take action.,If the coolest and toughest guy who I looked up to growing up was comfortable enough to talk about it and seek help, then so should I.,I’m also fortunate enough to have a good relationship with my manager at work. We’ve previously worked together and have always got on well, at work and as friends. So, telling her was another huge weight off my shoulders as well.,Just telling this handful of people – the people that I spent the most time with daily – let me finally be myself, warts and all, at home and work.,Only a few people know and I still don't talk about it a lot. I guess there's still that stigma around men's mental health which needs to change. So, if you think you might have something, then the best thing you can do is talk to someone.,If you’ve noticed a change in a friend or loved one, even just asking them if they’re ok, or how they’ve been feeling can help. They may not want to open up to you there and then, but at least they know you’re there and you care. And when they’re ready to talk about it, they know they can come to you.,There are so many organisations out there, with people who care and want to help. They offer support and advice to anyone who is experiencing mental health problems.,You don't have to suffer alone. Please, please take that first step to finally feeling better."
