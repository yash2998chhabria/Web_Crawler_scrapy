"Khushboo, ","It started with feeling irritated over small issues. I didn't look forward to spending time with my baby. My in-laws would make me loose my nerve. For no reason at all, I was getting angry at home. Even in the office, I didn’t feel like working anymore. I was losing enthusiasm for life and struggling to enjoy the things that would usually make me happy.,Gradually I lost interest in reading or any other activities and was losing confidence to talk to anyone. With days passing by, I started to loose weight, which i thought was normal after giving birth. My face was losing its glow, it looked dull and gloomy, but little did I care. Everyone, including me thought, I was just becoming lazy. Disturbed sleep at night started causing dark circles round my eyes. My body felt lethargic and my head felt dizzy as always, and my shoulders felt the load of burden that I never carried.,I couldn’t explain what was happening to me to anyone, so I remained silent. Even small household tasks seemed too much for me, and at work I started making mistakes because of my lack of concentration.,My husband was trying so hard to make me happy, but his failure to do so seemed to be irritating him too. Instead of cheering me up, family get togethers were having the reverse effect on me. It felt as though my husband and my family were kind of fed up with me. I felt as though thought me too arrogant to talk to them and spend time with them. ,I just wanted them to understand it's not that I was proud of anything, I just wanted to be in my little space. I know birthdays and celebrations are days to be happy, but I just couldn't bring myself to participate.,I just wanted them to ask me, ""What is going on with you? What has happened to you?"" Instead of judging me.,Going to work was too tiring, so I made the decision to take leave, but informing the office seemed so hard. I’d started becoming anxious and afraid. I felt like, all my colleagues has conspired against me to throw me out of my job. At home, I felt as though my in-laws were planning to throw me out.,These thoughts haunted me all night. I became so anxious and scared that I asked a colleague whether they had complained against me. Everyone denied this, but I knew they were lying. I became more lost, and eventually I stopped going to work. ,It was then that I was diagnosed with depression, after almost two years of my struggle.,Now I have a diagnosis, I realise why I was feeling the way I felt. Now I can tell myself that I will be fine someday. Slowly I may be able to manage it, with the support and medication.,Yet people still have questions.,“How can I have depression when I am living a fulfilled life?” I am married to a loving husband, own a house, have a lovely daughter, in-laws to support and a secure job.,People ask, ""What is there to worry about? Enjoy your life while you are still young."" But that is what I am unable to do right now. I just want to be in my small little cosy, safe, place.,At work, people judge me for being slow, or working with less enthusiasm, but depression makes it difficult to bring that level of energy sometimes. ,Depression is not just sadness, it is an illness which needs time to be healed or sometimes need to be managed throughout life. ,I wish there was more awareness so that people were able to suffer less, get an early diagnosis and access to treatment. "
"Suzie, ","At 16 years old I sat in my first therapy session and was told that I “had no real reason for having depression”. I was doing well in school, I had plenty of friends and there was no single particular traumatic event that had triggered the decline of my mental health. According to my therapist this made it impossible for me to feel anxious or depressed. After two more sessions I was totally convinced that I’d manifested these feelings myself and actually had perfect mental health, so I left.,Now, at aged 21, I can look back and see how I ignored my own mental health because I didn’t show the typical signs that are stereotyped by society.,Imposter syndrome, or the feeling of being a fraud, is a common experience felt in many situations, especially those in high-achieving roles. Imposter syndrome creates an extreme amount of self-doubt and ultimately leads to self-sabotage. In a way, I created my own imposter syndrome surrounding mental health, making myself believe that I was faking my own depression and anxiety disorder. Even when I was taking anti-depressants and attending regular sessions, I was committed to the imagined fact that I was making it up.,Whenever I tried to get help, there would always be a voice in the back of my mind saying that I was making it up and overthinking my problems, thinking there was an issue when there wasn’t. I would constantly refuse myself help because there was always someone out there worse off than me. I believed that if I was getting help, I was taking up time that could have been used by someone who really needed it.,Attending therapy, in turn, made my mental health worse. I would stress myself out thinking that I was fooling people and that I didn’t deserve to get help. Even now I feel uncomfortable discussing my mental health. I often think that if I open up to someone about how I’m feeling I won’t be believed and will be told similar things to what I have been in the past.  ,The portrayal of mental health in the media had such an impact on my thinking and I was constantly comparing my own experiences to those seen on television. I sometimes feels like producers try to tick every mental health box when introducing a storyline that follows the subject – and I willingly bought into the stereotypes that I was being shown.,Mental health representation in television feels like such a wasted opportunity. With such a huge platform, producers could use this to explore the reality of mental health. I’ve definitely noticed an increase in realistic plotlines surrounding mental health in television. Shows such as Crazy Ex Girlfriend explores the romanticising of mental health and breaks down terms like ‘crazy’ and ‘psycho’.,Unfortunately, it only takes one bad representation of mental health to reinforce pre-existing stereotypes.,Whether it’s the aggressive character suffering from BPD or the skinny obsessive calorie counting anorexic, there’s always opportunity to underpin people’s views on mental health blurring the lines between television and real-life struggles with mental health.,My issue was that I whole-heartedly believed the stereotypes I had seen on television. I wasn’t the typical ‘depressed’ teenager who never left the house and had anger issues. I put my insomnia, hopelessness and self-harming tendencies down to other reasonings, like I was just having a bad day or I was stressed because of work. I never associated this with my mental health issues because, in my mind, I didn’t have any.,It’s taken me years to connect to dots between the problems I’ve been experiencing and my mental health. I’ve finally accepted that I haven’t been imagining these problems, allowing myself to get the help I need."
"Kelsey, ","Depression is debilitating.,Some people understand it, some think it’s an attention call. For me, depression is like that pile of laundry that you don’t want to show in your Instagram pictures. I never want to show my pile of laundry to the world, I want my life to seem happy and put together, as if I folded and put away all my laundry right out of the dryer.,Ever since high school I have suffered with extreme depression and anxiety. I can defend the issue for hours and hours, however I get embarrassed when I feel sad. I get so embarrassed when I am sad and those around me do not understand and treat me as if I’m crazy.,Typically most of my life I’ve always just been called dramatic when I’m upset. It has become one of my biggest triggers, because most of my life I haven't had that fight to defend it. I just, quite simply, let it eat at me.,Depression can be the hardest when others just don’t understand you. I get sad for no reason so often that I’ve created safe spaces. In our current home, my safe place is my bathroom floor. Probably about at least three times a month you can find me locked in my bathroom on the floor, crying. The lock on that door is the only form of power I feel I have at that moment.,I see you.,I share this because it’s real, I share this because everyone has that pile of laundry.,I know everyone may not have depression, but everyone has something hard they’ve experienced, everyone has something to share and everyone has something to relate to.,Many times I have found myself on that bathroom floor contemplating life and how to make it past that very moment, will I? I have to say how thankful I am that I haven’t followed through. Life is so hard. Sprinkle on some depression, heck, dump it on - and life is now even more hard.,Please don’t ask me how I can be so sad I could contemplate suicide. Because honestly I do not know, nor do most people in that situation. How did we make it to this moment? What did I do to deserve this sorrow?,You never know who is hurting. Those who are, we often are the most resistant, waiting for a hand to be held out for us to grab onto as the pressure of our mental being closes in on us.,Check up on those who are quiet, those who check up on you; maybe conversation is being sparked due to their need to communicate. ,Let’s talk about our hard times, it’s healing, not embarrassing.,So, here’s my laundry pile. You’re not alone., "
"Neil, ","Depression can be a face of someone who is smiling, telling jokes and happy, which I am quite often. I have a family, a job and I am alive so why would I be depressed?,
It's hard to talk to people when you don’t know what reaction you will get. In the past, I’ve found out that people were talking behind my back, saying I am “needy” or “always on about myself”. But maybe I seemed like that because I needed a friend to lean on.,When you have been that person who is always there for others, and then that role changes because you need a shoulder, people can be so quick to judge.,
So for myself, it's either I wear this mask and keep smiling, pushing everything back…or I break down. There seems to be no in-between as I find it hard to talk. Not knowing HOW to talk about my feelings has impacted my own personal life because instead I react with “fight or flight”. I either want to scream and shout about how hard I am finding it, or I just want to run and hide which is unfair to the people I love.,
Even doing the simple tasks of talking, doing something around the house or picking what I want to do can sometimes feel like my head is going to explode, because I cannot process what is going on. So this is when my “fight or flight” kicks in.,
Thankfully this is not all the time and greatly depends on how I am feeling that day, as I have my good days and bad days. Some days I am as happy as can be like nothing is wrong, but this can change so quickly.,
For myself I need to open up, let people in and learn to talk but I also believe we need to live in a world where the judgment is left out, depression is acknowledged and we can openly talk."
"Mandy, ","For a long while, I've been having issues with mental health. I remember asking my mum one day years ago if hearing and seeing things was normal and her response still sticks with me. ""You're too young and don't know what REAL mental health problems are."",At the time I was incredibly depressed, anxious and scared of myself and what I might do. Whenever I tried to reach out and ask to see someone for help because I was seeing things, she always gave an excuse to dismiss what was going on, like I needed more sleep or I needed to ""stay off that phone!"". I just wish she might have listened a bit more, instead of brushing me off as lying, or getting angry and impatient with me. If she had been more supportive, I would have felt more capable of handling myself during my bad episodes. ,Considering that not even my own mother would believe me, I truly felt alone and thought that no one would listen to me and brush me off as liar or even a fake. It made it hard for me to reach out for help or take care of myself in the ways I needed.,Now that I'm in my later years of university and I'm in a relationship, I've had to be truthful to myself and acknowledge that I do have issues that need help with. It's taken me even longer to learn how to trust people, that people will reach out to help me if I ask for the help I dearly need. That I won't be told I'm too young or it's because I'm tired or because I'm on my phone too much before going to sleep.,It's taken me years to realize that I need help and that no one but me can choose whether or not what I'm dealing with is real. I don't need someone to compare their own experiences to mine and deem my cry for help as valid or not. But if I had a parent that believed me and took me to someplace where I could've gotten the help I needed, I think I would've been able to cope better with my conditions now.,Some people fail to realize that mental health doesn't discriminate against age and sadly for me it was the person I looked up to most that failed me."
"Helen, ","Ah, mental health stigma surrounding depression. The worst that's been said to me in the last 9 years of having depression is:,""Don't go and have a Helen moment on me!"",""Don't quit your job. I know your job has been making you feel depressed but you're being stupid. You haven't tried hard enough."",""Is that all your depressed about?"",""Stop being ungrateful and take your Great Aunt's advice!"",Please, stop.,This is not me being lazy, ungrateful or selfish. This is me dealing, sometimes suffering, with depression. This is my demon running its black toxins through my head, poisoning my thoughts and feelings.,Depression is not an emotion, it's an illness. A completely and utterly illogical illness. Just like with colds, for example, some colds can just be a little sniffle, sneeze, etc, while some colds can completely wipe you out and keep you bed-bound for x amount of time. Whether you have a mild cold or one from hell, you still have a valid cold. People with the strongest immune systems can still be affected by them.,From an outsider’s point of view, sure, they would be able to see the positive things going on in your life. However, when depression strikes, for me at least, it feels like a part of my brain has turned off the switch to be able to enjoy things. If it's really bad, I'm unable to see the light at the end of the tunnel with whatever I'm dealing with. I can also feel like a shell of a person sometimes. It's as if my brain has temporarily sucked up my personality and misplaced it somewhere else. I'm there but not there at the same time.,I don't choose to do this, depression is basically trying to tie me down in a chair at the cinema, forcing me to watch its fake ""reality"" tale about how my life will always be rubbish, dark, etc and how I'm worthless. Sometimes I can fight it off, but other times it can catch me off guard and I believe it for a while. Depression, by the way, is one hell of a liar.,The best way I can describe the switch being turned off is while you can see the beautiful colours of the world, I only see black, grey and white. My favourite meal in front of me is suddenly tasteless mush. My favourite TV show/YouTube channel is changed to, what feels like, a very boring presentation about something I've never been remotely interested in. Going out with loved ones can feel like everyone is spinning around me in fast motion while I'm sitting there in slow.,Depression is one of the worst things I have ever experienced, and I wouldn't wish it on anyone. Thankfully over the last 9 years I've learned to differentiate my depression thoughts from my healthy thoughts. I know my depression is just trying to make me watch a fake tale about me and my life, like how I described earlier, but I know I can beat it each and every time it knocks me. Depression might be strong but I'm much, much stronger.,Please do not judge other people's struggles and do listen to what they have to say. Their mountain may be a molehill to you, but everyone is different and everyone’s feelings are valid. Please, please always remember that.,Talking saves lives."
"Adam, ","It's been two years since my very first dealing with depression and anxiety.,I remember the day when I first hit a low point in life and it's not a nice memory to have. I didn't know how to deal with such a strong mental health issue, so I hid my problems away from family and friends which made my issues worse.,I didn't want to get out of bed, I didn't want to socialise with friends and I’d put off family days out. There came a time when I questioned my existence in life; was I a burden? Was I even worth having around? What did I bring to life in general?,One day everything just got too much, and I sadly and now regrettably tried to take my own life, not once but twice. It was at this point when I knew I needed professional help and I needed to speak out, which started my recovery to this day.,I received help and support from a lot more people than I ever expected.,Men are usually surrounded by toxic masculine stereotypes, e.g always being told to ' man up ' which shouldn't be the case - and this is why men find it so hard to open up about their problems whether it be mental health, illnesses, financial problems or addictions.,I personally haven't experienced anybody telling me to 'man up' or 'grow some balls' - fortunately I've been brought up around family and friends who have always told me the best way to get through your troubles is to openly speak out, whether that be to a professional or to a family member or friend. Nobody should be made to feel alone and closed in, especially if they're going through changes in life or mental struggles.,I took it upon myself to talk on BBC Humberside radio about my experience and started to work closely with smaller organisations to help beat the stigma surrounding mental health towards men. ,Choosing to openly speak out isn't for everybody and certainly isn't easy. It does take a lot of courage and confidence which I had to build back up from scratch. ,After many toxic past relationships which didn't help in my favour for my mental illness, I am now in a happy place - not just with a beautiful woman who I idolise and worship, but most importantly with myself. ,I believe that with determination comes willpower, and with willpower comes the road to recovery. I do still suffer from mild depression and anxiety so I'm not quite there yet myself. It’s still a battle I’m fighting, but I have so much more fight in me than I used to have 2 years ago. My anxiety still makes me feel like I may lose what’s important to me and that I'll mess up in some way or another, when in hindsight everything in life is going well so far. It's something I need to overcome, and something I know I will conquer within time. ,A little message to those who have read this today (and I thank you if you have): ,When you're feeling low, try and remember you're loved and cared for more than you think. You're doing great even if you feel otherwise - you're doing a brilliant job and things don't just get better with a click of your fingers (although I wish they did). When the time is right, you know when you'll be ready to speak out."
"Dan, ","My story? Well, I only realised that I had symptoms of clinical depression recently. And probably that I've had it a lot longer than I thought.,I was always of the belief that depression was a result of a traumatic event, a loss, stress, unhappiness at home, being bullied, those types of things. But it turns out you can just have bad brain chemistry. My brain just doesn't produce enough serotonin.,It dawned on me that I no longer enjoyed the things I used to love. I couldn't remember the last time I laughed. And I mean the belly-cramping, nose-snorting kind. Reading, drawing, playing games, and going for walks didn't make me feel the way they used to. It was starting to affect my work, and I showed little interest or put any effort into my relationship of 9 years.,This was the person that I had spent 3 and a half years travelling the world with. The person who I had bought my first home with. We were doggy parents to a beautiful German Pointer puppy now, and I showed no interest or enthusiasm for making lasting memories or a lovely home together. I just existed. Going through the motions day after day until oblivion. Even though I was always there, she must have felt so alone.,That's not living, that's wasting time.,All through my teenage years, my 20's and most of my 30's I've always been told that I'm so laid back, relaxed and nothing ever bothers me. I always believed that these were good personality traits. Ever agreeable, 'happy' to go with the flow and always aiming to please.,But there were other signs as well. I never had much drive or motivation to do well academically. I often felt worthless, tired, hopeless, and anxious.,I dismissed the notion of it being depression, as I had no reason to be sad.,I had a great childhood with loving parents. I'd found my soulmate and now owned a house in a beautiful part of the country. I had a good job with good people. And I was healthy, and so was everyone important to me.,So why was I feeling like this?,I decided to seek help about a year ago now. My depression had reached a point where I just wanted to vanish into a puff of smoke. Everything, every task, every email, every small job felt like an absolute chore.,So, as silly as I thought I was being, I went to see my doctor. And even before finishing my first sentence I completely broke down. It all came out and as bad as I felt, it was a relief to finally tell someone how I was feeling. That first conversation was a hugely important first step to a happier me.,It’s been a long road. I'm not going to lie and say that the medication (Sertraline aka Zoloft) cured me overnight. I still feel down, tired and some days are still a struggle. But I'm a lot better. My relationship is healthy again, I'm focused at work and enjoying life a little more each day. She’s been very supportive and now understands why there are some days when I don’t want to talk or do anything. Aspects of my behaviour that used to be annoying now have an explanation.,And this made a big difference to me too. Whereas previously I felt like I had to thrust “happy” me to the forefront every day, I no longer needed to. This only drains you further in the long term, and the cracks will start to show. For me, this mostly manifested itself as irritability. I had no patience for anyone or anything and I’d snap and backchat at even the most trivial things.,I’ve always had a very close relationship with my brother and sister. They’re two of my best friends. Furthermore, my older brother has suffered from depression for some years now. So talking to him about how he was feeling and what he did about it helped me take action.,If the coolest and toughest guy who I looked up to growing up was comfortable enough to talk about it and seek help, then so should I.,I’m also fortunate enough to have a good relationship with my manager at work. We’ve previously worked together and have always got on well, at work and as friends. So, telling her was another huge weight off my shoulders as well.,Just telling this handful of people – the people that I spent the most time with daily – let me finally be myself, warts and all, at home and work.,Only a few people know and I still don't talk about it a lot. I guess there's still that stigma around men's mental health which needs to change. So, if you think you might have something, then the best thing you can do is talk to someone.,If you’ve noticed a change in a friend or loved one, even just asking them if they’re ok, or how they’ve been feeling can help. They may not want to open up to you there and then, but at least they know you’re there and you care. And when they’re ready to talk about it, they know they can come to you.,There are so many organisations out there, with people who care and want to help. They offer support and advice to anyone who is experiencing mental health problems.,You don't have to suffer alone. Please, please take that first step to finally feeling better."
"Liz, ","I've been suffering from depression for just under four years, and depression has a way of replacing your confidence with pure anxiety and self-hatred. ,The scariest thing I found about suffering from a mental illness is the effect it has on every aspect of your life; it’s not just what’s inside your head. For me, suffering from depression became debilitating as I couldn't find happiness in the little things I used to enjoy doing. More often than not, depression would cause me to sit in my room and cry, usually for no reason at all.,I was told a lot that 'I had nothing to be depressed about' and that 'I’ll get over it’ because I have a great group of friends and no enemies to worry about, but the real enemy I had made was with myself.,Depression is something that cannot be healed simply, and I wish I had been told just how easy it can be to fall back into a spiral of severe isolation and anxiety.,It's so typical to believe that depression is nothing more than being sad. Depression isn’t feeling sad; if it were, it would be so much easier to deal with. Every time I'd let depression affect me, my body would go into shut down as I'd hardly sleep, I'd be sick: I had no energy to fight how I felt. ,I’d be asked what triggered me to feel ‘sad’, and I felt so humiliated that I didn’t have a ‘trigger’; depression hits you when you least expect it, and it comes in frequent waves. As well as being physically fatigued, my depression led to paranoia, which had a huge impact on my life, causing me to fret and become severely overwhelmed, and so, the cycle continued between being paranoid, which made me panic, which made me depressed. I wish I had been told that depression isn't something to be ashamed of, as telling people I had depression was a task I still struggle to achieve.,Sadly, I’ve found that depression (as well as other mental illnesses) are romanticized, especially in the media. There really isn’t anything glamorous about suffering from depression, and it’s important that this trend is stopped before it gets out of hand. ,It’s so true when you hear that support is always available, whether it be from friends, families, charities or organisations, but seeking this kind of support made me feel uncomfortable at first. Depression isolates you, making you believe your importance matters less than those around you. Depression pushed so many people out of my life to the point where I feared forming friendships, because the pain of losing the people I loved was too much to bear.,It was important that my friends would embrace my depression rather than see it as a flaw of mine, so I began openly talking about it to those around me, and by raising awareness, quite a few of my friends stepped forward to say they had been through the same, or at least knew somebody who did. ,By accepting my depression and openly discussing it with others, I didn't feel as ashamed anymore.,I realised for the first time that I wasn’t alone, and mental illness is actually far more common than we’re led to believe. ,Mental illness isn’t a trend, but it shouldn’t be a taboo either. One day, we’ll find the middle ground."
"Lauren, ","I can almost set my clock by it. Seasonal affective disorder, or SAD,  is a sneaky illness, at least in my experience. I’ve had this leafy, dark cloak in my closet for about seven years now. It comes out only from about mid-October and gets shoved away at the end of February, and weighs heavily on my back.,As I’ve got older, the intensity of my symptoms has increased. I’m still without a diagnosis, but I feel I haven’t got the energy I need to fight to prove that there is a real pattern to having depression as the weather deteriorates into dark mornings and dark nights that seem to be endless, with rain falling and sunlight in scarce supply.,I find SAD really difficult to explain to others that have never had it or any other mental illness, because we all experience things differently.,2020 is the first year I have really spoken this openly about my SAD, as previously I was afraid to mention having my mental health affected by the seasons changing, that others just think it would be an excuse for being grumpy, or in ‘one of those moods’.,To finally stop all the self-stigmatising, to stop all of the behaviour that must look really odd to my work colleagues and friends, like making a strange excuse to rush outside for some precious vitamin D in a freezing wind with a winter sun.,Seasonal affective disorder is real, and can be a serious issue. January tends to be the worst time of year for me, as it gets colder, it’s still dark a lot of the time which is reflected within my mood. It isn’t only the feeling low in mood, it’s having a short fuse, sleeping problems, it’s the feeling of ‘do I really have to face the day again?’ on some mornings, opening the curtains to dark grey skies and heavy rain with an instant inner sigh. It’s the lacking in motivation, the knowing that no matter what you say, someone won’t ‘get’ it and will somehow find it funny or wind you up. It’s happened too many times where I’ve snapped at someone and instantly regretted it, or burst into tears over a single comment.,The additional anxiety that comes alongside it is quite debilitating too, making my existing social anxiety and generalised anxiety disorder worsen, but this is almost invisible to most.,There are things that I have found incredibly helpful though. Medication, though it doesn’t work for everyone, including vitamin D supplements, really helps maintain my mood at a manageable level. I invested in a special SAD specific lightbox, which has made a tremendous difference – the light produced by the light box simulates the sunlight that's missing during the darker winter months, and I use it while having breakfast for around 10 minutes a day, which has had a dramatic effect!,I also have found that listening to my favourite music helps a lot, and so does writing, either creatively or in poetry – getting how I feel down on paper is really good for my mood sometimes. I go walking in nearby nature spots or parks, or even just around the block for 20 minutes, and combine this with my other passion of photography, and find it really calming and uplifting to listen to the world around me, although some day I have to almost force myself outside for a walk because I know if I don’t then I’ll feel a lot worse for not doing so. Having someone to talk to that doesn’t try and fix you is incredible, or even one that just listens to you."
"Edwin, ","Before I was diagnosed with depression, anxiety and severe ADHD, I was quite oblivious to mental health issues. Since then, I have gained a much deeper insight on how society views and deals with these issues. I have also come to realise how my words effect the way people interact with me, and how they view me as a person. Words are powerful. Which is why I have said publicly, “when I keep quiet, stigma wins – and I can’t let that happen”.,Stigma is something I have had to deal with on an almost daily basis – especially in the workplace. Over time, you learn to deal with it, but the scars stay with you. They act as a reminder that the stigma attached to mental illness is real.,I would say the biggest drivers of stigma in my country are a lack of awareness / information and harmful stereotypes. In Kenya, common misconceptions include ideas that people with mental health issues cannot recover, that people with mental health issues are violent, that we are incompetent and that we are to blame for our illness.,There are many negative economic and social ramifications attached to having mental health conditions – which can serve to further add to the stigma.,I am naturally a very vocal person. Before becoming a Champion with this global anti-stigma programme, I had spoken out about mental health on social media and I had also taken part in mental health advocacy.,However, now, I am part of a group of Champions who are challenging stigma on mental health issues. It feels like being in a big family that understands you – during bad times and good.,What is even more encouraging is the knowledge that in other countries the same thing is happening. I had the chance to meet with Champions from Ghana, India, Nigeria and Uganda. This event in my home city of Nairobi brought together five different cultures and languages, but the most inspiring thing was that we all found a common language, the language of anti-stigma.,This language knows no race, religion, gender, creed, or political allegiance. This common drive to end mental health stigma, bound us together as Champions and friends. We are moving forwards together to change the world.,For everyone reading this toolkit, I hope you can share this common language too. I think one thing we all need to embrace is that learning never stops. Amazing work is happening around the world to end mental health stigma.,Exchanging ideas and sharing the challenges faced in different countries will make all our work stronger.,The one thing I would love everyone reading this to know is this: Stigma hates conversations that challenge its’ existence. So, let us start having raw and candid conversations about mental health conditions and the stigma we are facing.,When we all start to do this, we will see a world where people with mental health problems are treated as human beings.,---, "
"Michelle, ","I wish I could give 2018 me a look into this year. I feel like a completely different person, and my whole attitude towards mental health has completely changed. ,A year ago I was stuck in a job I couldn’t stand. My mental health was in ruins. And I could barely get out of the door. Every day I would sit in my local coffee shop and question whether I had the strength to get through the day. There came a time when I couldn’t sit at my desk for longer than a few hours without gasping for air in fear of what was to come. ,I opened up about my mental health to my boss, and sadly this was where the situation got much worse. I was constantly belittled, told my mental health was having a negative impact on the team, and that I couldn’t work flexibly in case I was seen to be receiving special treatment, even though my office had a flexible working policy.,When I was off sick, I was sent emails of a bullying nature, and on the day I was diagnosed with depression, I was told I was making my boss’s job harder. At a time when I was finding it hard to see the bigger picture because I was stuck in the black hole of depression, I took this incredibly seriously and it made my condition much worse.,I didn’t receive the help I deserved at work, until I eventually, after months of comments on my mental health, I made a formal complaint of harassment and bullying. Had my boss, and my workplace, had training into supporting someone with a mental health problem, I might still be there.,I will never forget the fear of going to work for what my boss would say to me that day, or the feeling of not wanting to wake up the next morning.,To feel like I’d gone from someone thriving in my career to being told I was failing to make a contribution, was shattering. I eventually got an apology, and my boss soon left the company. ,I finally got the help I needed to help me move on from the experience, and I developed the tools I needed to manage my condition at work. I’d be deluded if I said the depression was gone. It hasn’t and there are days when I feel the dark cloud coming over me, and I feel suffocated by my own thoughts. But I’ve learned to accept them, and deal with each day as it comes.,I can now look back on my negative experience at work as a learning. It forced me to grow up and accept my condition rather than fear it, and to take the confidence in knowing what was best for me and standing up for myself and what support I needed.  In coming out of the hardest year of my life, and through my mental health diagnosis, I have learnt what true resilience is. ,I wish my work had been given the support they needed to support me. Both me and my boss gave up our careers at an incredible job because neither of us knew how to cope at the time. Education and training are key. We all deserve to feel safe at work.,When we feel weak, we need the support of our workplace to give us the flexibility we need to be well as well as productive. Without an understanding of mental health at work, stories like mine will continue to be the norm. ,A recent survey of the charity sector uncovered some uneasy reading about bullying and mental health at work. Whilst this made me realise I’m not alone, it also made me realise just how important it is to speak openly about mental health and how we are feeling. We must all continue to call out the injustices people with mental health conditions face at work if we are to make real change for future generations. ,Nobody should be belittled into thinking their condition is a burden because their manager doesn’t have the experience or training to support you.,All mental health conditions are difficult for you and the people around you, but with the right tools, and the right help, you can have a career.,We’ve a long way to go. But there is hope. I didn’t feel it then, but I certainly feel it now. It really is time to change"
"Candice, ","Growing up in my household was a bit of a struggle. Around the age of 12, I was bullied quite severely, which in turn had an impact on my mental health. I began to experience symptoms of anxiety and depression. I was always a reserved, quiet person but I built up the courage to talk to my mum about how I was feeling.,I went into the kitchen to talk about being bullied and how it made me feel. I was expecting some understanding and comfort but that is not what I received. To this day, I remember exactly what she said to me, ""You're too young to be depressed. What do you have to be depressed about?”,The response made me feel like my feelings did not matter as I was ‘young’ and had not experienced life yet. At times, I believe that I was not taken seriously due to my age. I was young, so perhaps my mum believed what I was feeling at the time was temporary. I felt sad for some time as I hoped that I could at least talk to my mum and get some encouragement. The topic wasn’t discussed for some time and I was always the one to bring it up.,As my mum didn’t understand me and how I was feeling, I turned to my cousin who understood my feelings completely. I expressed how my mother’s response made me feel and she assured me that her response is ‘typical’ of the older, west Indian generation. Mental health is somewhat of a taboo topic within West Indian culture; some people with mental health disorders are often referred to as ‘crazy’ with little acknowledgement of what the person may be facing.,Not only was discussing feelings and topics that are sensitive in nature rarely discussed, when it was eventually brought up, most of the time the topic was dismissed or the issue was minimised.,If I could turn back time, I wish my mother reassured me and comforted me insisting that what I was feeling was valid regardless of my age. Depression and anxiety can affect all ages regardless of creed, religion, or colour. I wished that she was able to understand that symptoms of depression and anxiety can overlap, life experience can create these symptoms and that you can’t just pray mental health conditions away.,I tried countless times to talk to my mother about it, but she told me repeatedly to just ‘pray about it’. I took her advice, but it did not help me. I guess that was the best advice she could offer and that may have been taught to her.,For those who have a loved one who may be struggling with their mental health, reassure them that you are there to support them. Providing an individual who may be struggling with their mental health with a support system can have a positive impact on their wellbeing. Be cautious when you talk to them and don’t force them to talk to you about issues they may be facing. If you provide a safe space for them, they may be willing to talk to you in their own time. If they do decide to confide in you, please be mindful with your responses. Listen to understand and try not to judge them.,Everyone has a different way of dealing and coping with issues that they may be struggling with. My family doesn’t always understand me, but I am ok with that. Going to therapy has taught me that I am only responsible for me and no one else. Some people may underestimate how much mental health has an impact on our day to day lives.,I aim to try and talk about mental health more often with my family regardless of the response I get. Now, my mum has become more open with regards to discussing mental health which I am happy about. We are all just taking it one day at a time and counting our blessings in the process."
"Claire, ","I’ve lived with anxiety and depression along with an eating disorder pretty much as long as I can remember, but understand that that doesn't define me: I am ME.,I have never really felt stigmatised because of this, and I’m very much a 'take me as I am' person, at least on the outside. Recently though, I had my first blatant experience of stigmatisation, and I’m so angry and shocked I feel I need to speak out about it...,I went on a date with a guy, we had spoken for the previous week and he knew pretty much from the offset about my mental health issues, and I knew his ex had similar problems to me. At the end of the date he said he thanked me for the good evening and I said I would message. He told me not to, which I was taken aback by but let go over my head. I messaged him yesterday to see how he was to which he responded I 'wasn't the lady for him' because of my anxiety and depression. ,I was nice about it (as always) but it has left me with such a bitter taste in my mouth...here’s what I wish I had said to him:,“Do you know what – I’m actually angry that I apologised to you. How dare you stigmatise me because of my mental health?,I am ME, not my condition, and I can tell you that you have missed out on someone and something amazing.,I am one of the most loving, compassionate and dare I say it, AWESOME people you will ever know, and I refuse to get down because of your small-mindedness. ,I know you have had a bad experience in the past, but I told you from the outset about my issues. To carry it on and go on a date, almost out of pity, is not on. I wish you luck on finding someone as good as the woman your small-mindedness just lost you.”,I live with anxiety, depression and an eating disorder, but I am me, I am unique...and a pretty awesome unique at that. Your loss mate!"
"George, ","I’ve always been open about my mental illness in most areas of my life, but until last year I’d never spoken about it at work. I was concerned that if I told colleagues I struggle with general , disorder and ,, it would hamper my progression and I wouldn’t be taken seriously.,
I was diagnosed a few years ago, and there have only been a few periods where my mental illness has affected my capacity to work. Last summer, my responsibilities increased dramatically in a short space of time, creating a lot of anxiety. It began to affect my mood at home; I was irritable, unable to relax and constantly low, which was a big warning sign.,So, I decided to say something. Talking about my mental health with my loved ones has always made things so much easier, and I realised that I needed the same at work. During a one to one with my line manager I ended up explaining my mental illness and the struggles I have. Her reaction was incredible. She thanked me for being honest, assured me I’d have the support I needed and even spoke about her own mental health. It felt so good to have opened up in such a huge area of my life, and my manager’s warmth and compassion dissolved any worries I’d had about being judged.,This went a long way to helping when my mental health took a turn for the worse just before Christmas. I started struggling badly with insomnia - something I’ve dealt with before due to childhood trauma. It made me extremely anxious and depressed. I felt ashamed, but also petrified that I’d never be able to sleep properly again, and that this would completely erode my sanity.,The festive period gave us a week and a half off from work and things seemed to improve; I was sleeping well and my mental health was evening out again as I got used to the course of antidepressants I’d recently started.,My problems returned as soon as I went back to work in early January. I couldn’t sleep and the anxiety and depression swept back in. Suicidal thoughts flew into my mind. I went into the office as much as I could, but my mind was consumed by fear and panic all the time.,My manager sat me down and told me to have a serious think about taking a few weeks off work. I was worried that it might do more harm than good, so took a few days to think about it. Both my manager and her line manager gave me all the information I needed and went out of their way to assure me that it wouldn’t cause problems for the rest of my team.,When I told them that my GP had signed me off for two weeks, they were incredibly supportive. In fact, they essentially ordered me to not think about work at all while I was away - they wanted me to completely focus on getting better. This lifted a huge weight off my shoulders and allowed me the time and space to properly recover.,Before I started my break, several colleagues sent me messages of support and let me know they were there to talk. Depression can make you feel completely alone, but knowing that people have your back is so empowering.,My two weeks off ended up being extended to a full month, and in that time my colleagues sent me a card and regularly checked in to see how I was doing. To know I was in their thoughts made me feel worthwhile again and saved me from feeling cut off. It also helped me return to work; there weren’t worries about how people would react. I knew they supported me, and it was liberating to have them know what I was going through.,I had a phased return, but what also helped was how my manager and colleagues pulled together to support me once I was back. I was allowed to take things at my own pace, and no one made me feel inferior. In fact, they all treated me just as they had before I took time off. I wasn’t seen as a special case, or broken in anyway, which helps to normalise things. It also meant that when someone at work asks how I’m doing, I don’t just have to say ‘OK, thanks.’ I now know that if I’m having trouble, I can be honest about it, and that is a huge help.,Being open about my mental health at work has been a vital part of my recovery, and to have such a compassionate reaction from my friends in the office made things so much easier."
"Aparna, ","It’s hard to tell if a person is depressed unless they break down in front of you or manage to tell you themselves. , doesn’t leave scars, not always. And it’s hard to say how bad it is if you can’t see the wound.,If you know someone who’s going through a difficult time, if you have even the slightest doubt, reach out.,Even if you think it wouldn’t help, do it. Even if you think bringing it up could make it worse, or that it wouldn’t make a difference at all, even if it makes you uncomfortable, do it.,They don’t need much from you.,First, understand that their state of mind, the place they’re in, is on a different dimension. Depression is not just an extreme version of the sadness that you know, it’s sadness on a whole other dimension, one that is comparable and yet is entirely different, so different you can’t even begin to imagine it.,So, let me tell you what you can’t see. You can’t see they’re numb inside when they laugh at your jokes, that they haven’t eaten in three days, that they wish they won’t wake up when they go to bed every night.,It is important that you do see it, that you at least show that you want to. Because that person needs you. They need someone, anyone, to tell them it’ll get better. They might get through it alone, they’re strong, no doubt. They’ll talk themselves out of harming themselves, cry themselves to sleep, drag themselves to get help, and convince themselves to keep going another day. And they just might. But maybe they won’t. The illness bends their mind, tells them to stop fighting, and convinces them there’s nothing left to fight for.,In those times, they will need you to say that it’s all a lie. That they deserve to see the other side of the darkness, and that you will sit by them till they no longer need to fight. That the little hope they have is real. That their dark thoughts are nothing more than chemical imbalances – it’s not them, just a temporary tarp covering their light, that a beautiful life is waiting for them at the other end, waiting for them to get through some more time. That it’ll be worth it. Say it over and over again. Till they believe it. And then say it again.,If you don’t know what to do, ask them. Even a “You okay?” means a lot.,It could make me take a break from crying into a pillow to watch Netflix for a bit. It could slow down an escalating bad day, make me feel just a little less lost, enough to get through the rest of the day. Ask them if they ate anything all day. You don’t need to come up with some speech. You don’t need to say anything at all – sit next to them. Hold their hand while they try not to break down.,And for those who are going through any version of a difficult time right now, or ever have, know that you deserve such support, and you might already have it. You might even have the best possible people in your life and still not have quite the support you need. That’s perfectly normal. It’s not that you don’t deserve it, or they don’t care enough, they just don’t really know what you need. It’s sad and unfair, I know. But that’s okay. Take all the help you can get. Or ask for it. I swear they’ll want to.,You’re capable of getting through this. But you don’t have to do it alone."
"Phil, ","I was first diagnosed as having depression in 2004 following the death of my father, nothing overly surprising there. In time, my mental health improved.,I had some ‘ups’ and ‘downs’ over the next few years, but I was relatively stable. Until, that is, my second son was born. Looking back now, it’s quite easy to recognise that I was suffering from ,, but at the time I never considered it could be a possibility. I felt a panic build inside me, and afterwards I just found it difficult to bond with him. My wife at the time was breastfeeding and so I was left out, and whenever I asked if I could do anything to help, I was usually met with sarcastic comments.  Things got worse as time went on, and my inability to develop that bond, made it seem to her that I wasn’t trying to help out.,I failed to understand what was going on. I was struggling with low mood, short term memory loss, and general lethargy and lack of motivation – but she saw me as being lazy and awkward.,It built to a head. My wife found me in tears and when she asked me what was wrong, I told her that I had figured out that her and the boys would be better off without me. Her response… “Don’t be so stupid!”,It was at this time I went to our GP and was put back onto anti-depressants for the first time since my dad had died.,I told my boss what was going on at home, and he put me onto the company Employee Assistance Program, and I started receiving counselling.  My wife took offense to this.,It would just have been nice to have a “How are you getting on?” or “Are you okay?” but I felt very isolated and alone, unable to talk to anyone for fear of getting the same reaction from others.  I was definitely made to feel “less than a man” by her and it was most certainly a concern that I would be viewed as weak by others.,Ultimately, this led to our marriage breaking down and I had to move out.,I’ve spent the last 7 years essentially hiding from everyone – and most importantly, from myself – that I was still suffering from depression. This has affected my physical health too, and I now have IBS and migraines associated with anxiety and depression.,I’ve had a great deal of time off work sick, and nearly lost my job because of it. But it was the thing that gave me the kick I needed to admit what was going.,I can honestly say it was one of the hardest things I’ve ever had to do – admit I need help!,As it transpired, when I finally opened up, I was surprised by the number of people who then turned around and said “I know what you mean. I went through something, some years back…”  That and finding out people I know quite well, who have also been diagnosed with depression, that I had no idea about either.  I still feel a bit “odd” talking so openly about it now, but it is getting easier and less uncomfortable.,I’m now involved in a study of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) and I’m starting to get the help I so badly needed. Unfortunately, having waited so long, I’ve got 10-years worth of depression and anxiety to overcome. It’s become part of my normal day-to-day routine to lie about how I’m feeling and hide it from everyone, a cycle I’m finding hard to break.,I wish I had asked for help much, much sooner. But that said, there was much more stigma around mental health 10 years ago and were I to have said something, would I have gotten the help I’m receiving now…? Who knows! But the fact that there are organisations like Time to Change around has made things easier for those of us who are suffering and need help, to step forward and ask."
"Fern, ","I love summer. Lighter evenings, longer days, warmer weather, summer dresses, perhaps even some sun if we’re lucky. Generally speaking, as seems to be common with most people I speak to –  when the sun is out, I’m in a better mood. However, as someone who also experiences periods of depression, I’ve found that this isn’t generally the case when it comes to my mental health.,I’m fortunate that I’m currently in a much better place at the moment but, when I think back to a few years ago, I found the summer months to be an immense struggle.,When the clocks sprung forward, it all felt a little bit daunting. The things I’d usually look forward to about the change in seasons now served as reminders that I really wasn’t ok.,The lighter evenings and longer days meant more time counting down the hours until it was dark enough to go to sleep. The warmer weather meant more plans to cancel and, as a result, more excuses to make up. I couldn’t even muster up the enthusiasm to decide what to wear each day – something which would ordinarily bring me a lot of enjoyment – and so the summer dresses stayed at the back of my wardrobe.,Perhaps depression is a little easier to understand in the winter. It’s dark, it’s cold, most people are spending evenings at home not really doing much. If I was having a particularly bad day / week / month, it didn't feel so wrong to get home from work, change into my pyjamas and just go to bed.,Yet when summer rolled around, it seemed as though everyone was out and about having the ‘best time ever’. ,And then there I was, struggling to get out of bed.,For someone experiencing depression, it can be difficult to watch those around you enjoying themselves. I'd mute group chats so as not to be met with the constant barrage of plans, I'd excuse myself from after-work drinks, and I'd invent reasons not to attend BBQs and family gatherings.,“But it’s such a nice day…” people would say, “you should get out the house, it might cheer you up."",Yes it was a nice day but, whilst their words were well-meaning, they simply weren't helpful. I already felt as though I was wasting my summer and I knew I should get out the house, but it just didn't seem possible. A nice walk on a sunny afternoon might do wonders if I'm just having an 'off day', but depression is so much more than that, and a sunny afternoon isn't a cure.,Depression doesn't care about the weather, your weekend plans, or the birthday coming up that you'd do anything to be able to enjoy. It doesn't think to itself ""summer is here, time for me to disappear for the next few months."" That isn't how it works.,I'm in the fortunate position of having friends I could be honest with. Friends who would still keep inviting me to things 'in case I felt up to it' and didn't judge me when I stopped replying to messages for days or weeks on end. They'd suggest shorter periods of socialising that felt a lot less daunting, and remind me that they were still around if and when I felt up to going out.,In more recent years, I've managed to enjoy my summers without the weight of depression casting a shadow over them to quite the same extent, and for that I'm incredibly thankful. I think my own experience has also made me more aware of how others might be feeling, and I'd encourage anyone who thinks a friend might be struggling to try to understand and have a little patience. "
"Jack, ","I work in a large factory, so I meet a lot of people with very different attitudes and opinions about mental health. I was diagnosed with severe depression just over 8 years ago. At that time I had a few months off work, had counselling and went on to medication. My employers were good and understanding. But the people I work with are a different matter. ,I don’t advertise that I have depression but I make no secret of it. If someone wants to talk to me about it, I will talk. And a few people have genuinely been interested.,I’ve had a few bad episodes where I needed some time off. I’ve tried to keep these to a minimum but sometimes just getting out of bed is all I can manage. All my efforts are spent fighting off the suicidal thoughts and just coping through the days.,I had a good working relationship with my manager and she was very supportive. It was during one of these episodes that the conversation happened. My manager was telling two of the crew members, who knew about my mental health issue, that I wouldn’t be in for a while. The two guys had always seemed to empathise with me. One of them, who had been in hospital years earlier because of a mental breakdown and depression, asked my manager: what use was I to anyone if I was going keep having time off?,My manager defended me, and told them: if I was fighting a physical illness, they wouldn’t be saying that.,A factory is a place where everything gets around - and when I got back to work I heard about it. Knowing that a factory is also a hive of gossip too I chose not to believe it, putting it down to rumours. But it ate away at me every time I saw them. ,I challenged my manager about it, and to my surprise, she confirmed that they had said it. Since that day I have been very wary about the false empathy and empty gestures that people throw out. It has made me very jaded and even more guarded than I was previously. ,It’s hard to know when people are genuine, so I now try not to discuss mental health with anyone. A very backward step for me but stigma and attitude, I believe haven’t changed. People are often just learning the right phrases to say, paying lip service to the buzz words of the moment. Where I think things have moved forward is that people that have these illnesses of the mind are coming together and supporting each other.,One of the crew members that said these things has a son who is now suffering from depression. He comes to me for advice on what his son should do. I inwardly hate this person and their ignorance but wear the “I’m ok” mask every day. I wouldn’t wish this illness on my worst enemy so I genuinely help the best I can. ,In my experience people don’t learn about mental illness until it hits them square between the eyes and they are forced to.,On a negative, you never know what tomorrow will bring - on a positive, you never what tomorrow will bring. Stay strong."
"Molly, ","I have been fighting depression for more than 10 years. Over a decade of late nights and toxic behavior and having to pretend the next day that nothing is wrong. ,I never know how to explain depression to someone. It’s so different for everyone and comes in so many different forms. Some people describe their depression as a weight that holds them down, ever-present and demanding of their time. Others describe it as a shadow that looms in the back of your mind, always taunting and jabbing and trying to tear you down. Some days, you just have thicker skin. And then sometimes, depression is described like drowning. It’s wading in an ocean of poison and barely catching your breath before you’re dragged back under. ,I don’t think people understand that depression is constant. Some days it doesn’t feel as heavy, it doesn't tug and pull as hard. And other days, it knocks you down before you can even get out of bed. ,I am always fighting this constant battle with myself. I may smile and laugh and seem happy, but know that, somewhere, in the back of my mind I'm struggling. The happy interludes, the in-between where the weight doesn’t feel as heavy, are simply vacations from the reality that is my depression.,It makes me feel like a failure, no matter my successes. I feel worthless and like I’m a burden on everyone around me.,My depression is a beast that lives inside me. It whispers horrible things in my ear, tells me that I am waste of space. And all the while, I have to smile and pretend I’m okay.,That life isn’t beating me, no way. I’m too stubborn for that. I have to pretend that there isn’t some rabid animal inside of me, clawing to get its grip around my throat and snuff out my life. ,People who don’t have depression don’t understand. But they can still be there for people like me. When they say something that scares you, don’t yell. Don’t get angry because you don’t comprehend how their mind works.,My mind is a scary place. I shouldn’t need to open up and spill my darkness for your compassion.  ,Support people with depression, even if you don’t understand. Just be there. "
"Natalie, ","Ah , and ,, my two controversial friends that have placed me in a non-consensual three-way relationship which is often very difficult to deal with. I can wake up some days and feel like I’m ready to take on anything. But on one side of the bed, I’ll have my anxiety badgering me about the million and one things that will go wrong today. And on the other side of the bed, my depression will remind me about the social event that I’ll be taking part in later that evening and casually reminding me that no matter how confident I’ll appear to be, that the people I think that love me in fact don’t, they’d rather I not be there, and that I’m weak and eventually push everyone I love away from me. And then I get up and get on with my day, after crying on my pillow, and admitting defeat.,Some would call me over-emotional. Some will tell me, and have told me before, to simply move past my problems and carry on. Some people just don’t understand how you can’t just put the thing that’s worrying you, or dragging you down, in the bin and never look back. Sometimes I am able to do this, and I feel better. But when I can’t, please understand that it’s not that I don’t want to feel happy or stop my brain racing. Believe me, if I could do it all the time, I would. But I am constantly battling my anxiety and depression, and sometimes they win, and it can be hard to control. Imagine playing your favourite video game and you have the controller, but sometimes, the controls will bug out, not work like they should, and it starts ruining your game. That is what my anxiety and depression feel like to me.,I don’t blame people that don’t understand my anxiety and depression, I really don’t. From an outsider looking in, it may just look like I’m over-reacting, that I’m dramatic and attention seeking. I’m very aware of what it may look like, but I promise it is not that. I take antidepressants to help keep my anxiety and depression on the low-down, but that doesn’t mean that I am ‘cured’. It also doesn’t mean that I am sick, or that I can’t be like anyone else, do things that everyone else can and live a relatively normal life. Because I can. I just occasionally put my training wheels back on when I feel like I need them.,I don’t need you to tell me to ‘stop worrying’ because I will always worry, even if my face and body language says otherwise. I sometimes need that reassurance that everything is ok, that I am loved, and that you won’t leave me when I need you the most, even if in the depths of my brain, my depression is telling me it’s not true. But I also don’t need you to be afraid of me, because underneath the dark cloud that my anxiety and depression form, there’s a normal human being who wants to be loved, is kind, understanding, has a sense of humour (or so I’d like to think) and always tries to put a smile on her face and on other people’s, even if it feels like I’m losing my battle.,Today has been a day where my anxiety and depression defeated me but writing this is my way of taking back control. It is temporary, and I have accepted that, but I’ll bounce back because I always do."
"Frances, ","I saw a lot of employers posting about Mental Health Awareness Week. It is absolutely crucial we start conversations about the realities of mental illness and it’s great that it’s happening, but I wish some employers would stop kidding themselves.,I’ve worked all my adult life, before, during and since my diagnosis and treatment. I was diagnosed with moderately severe , and , and , in 2007. I've had CBT (cognitive behavioural therapy), and am currently seeing a private therapist weekly. I never got so much as a displeased look… until I disclosed my mental health problem.,I have disclosed twice in corporate environments. Both times my employment became a cycle of letters requesting meetings asking why I was sick? Why did I get the flu so easily? My situation isn’t new. Since sharing my story, I’ve encountered many separate accounts detailing variations on my own experience. ,I’ve found employment nothing but a minefield of misunderstandings and complete unwillingness, (despite the initial platitudes), to actually accept and support employees with a mental illness. And now suddenly all these employers are declaring their “awareness” on every social media platform available to them; welcoming us into the workplace. As if they’ve always been there and I’m just too afraid to ask. Not that I can speak for anyone else, but there’s a reason I’ve become reticent, and it’s not fear of judgement; it’s experience of it.,It isn’t just about talking. Support is an ever-evolving process; the process of accepting who we are, without judgement and acting accordingly - and that isn’t limited to what your own idea of “equality” dictates. “Awareness” is something you can get from our application form. In my experience, this is where it gets uncomfortable for employers. They have all these policies for “work/life balance,” and still create an environment so pressured it becomes impossible to complete your workload without working through lunch. Let on that you’re struggling, by all means, but prepare to be asked the question: “is this a legitimate concern or is it just a symptom of your condition?” That’s a quote from an ex employer. The only conclusion I could draw from it at the time was “you have anxiety, so your concerns aren’t real.” This, in turn, caused more anxiety. I can’t think why.,Here’s another one:,This nugget of wisdom was imparted to me by a manager in a work setting with, I think overall, good - if fatally misguided - intentions. Implicit in their words was a very serious underlying problem: acceptance of potential discrimination as part of the infrastructure of the place of employment without open acknowledgement of its injustice., As I re-read this passage, I’m a bit indignant. Just try replacing “mental health” with any other condition and see how that sentence comes out:,I have remembered that sentence - that sentence and many others from people with more ""professional"" power than myself, who ""can't understand why a counsellor would advise"" this that or the other; who ask of my occupational health record: ""is it really relevant to the case?"" having not read it before calling me into a meeting to discuss whether to take punitive action over a flu virus: - (In this instance, it was particularly relevant as I was a recovering bulimic at the time with a compromised immune system).,I’ve been asked, (by a manager), ""how does your boyfriend deal with this?"",1. It's not relevant ,

Why am I something to be “dealt with?” I’m not a slug that turned up in your bathroom!,The answer, (not that I am obliged to share it), is unabashedly - ""he makes me a cup of tea and we get on with it.""  Their surprise at my answer denotes another significant lack of understanding and/or willingness to accept that what is being said is normal. There’s that word again: Accept. ,Allowing me the luxury of disclosure is not acceptance. Acceptance is not saying ""it's OK if you leave early for a counselling appointment."" That is a reasonable adjustment. Reasonable adjustment is the law. You're not doing us a favour by observing our human right to exist and be ill. ,Acceptance is going beyond the law and taking us out of the box we ticked. It's remembering we are human - more so than your average - and yes being uber-human is frightening because it magnifies the onlooker's vulnerability. We get it's scary to look at us being scared.,We cannot change the condition. Fact. So it's on you. You've posted your posts, you've tweeted your tweets. Congratulations. You're aware.,Now what are you going to do with it?"
"Conor, ","Two years ago, I started to experience mental health difficulties for the first time. What I mean by that is, two years ago I first became conscious of my own mental illness. My close friends will tell you that this all started long before two years ago. They are probably right but my own awareness only began when I was forced to retire from sport with injury in June 2017, aged 20.,Sport was a massive part of my life. It gave me my edge, a place to release my competitiveness, my aggression and my energy in a healthy way. To lose that before I hit my peak broke me. After finishing playing, I started to feel different almost immediately - less in control of my mood and my energy. I was due to go travelling with friends soon after and I used that as my suppression tool. I thought that partying and travelling would bring me back to myself.,I was sure all I needed was something to take my mind off things. Instead, the travelling, drinking and partying made things worse. Panic attacks and anxiety fits took over from fun and excitement. I’m a confident person, I’ve always been successful in academics, sport, my career, but that all felt very far away. Within weeks, I’d gone from an unstoppable person who could achieve anything, to someone who was scared to face the world. Suddenly, anxiety and depression surrounded my every waking moment. All I wanted to do was go home, I wasn’t me. I would wake up scared about having an anxiety attack, tension headache or down day. Sleep was the only relief, which as part of a despairing irony, became harder to come by as the condition continued.,I went to counselling when I returned from my holiday. I thought, “I’ll go for 3-4 sessions and I’ll be good as new, it was just that I was away from home and a bit shook”. I went in hoping for a magic cure for my , and ,, but I quickly realised that this doesn’t exist. Over time it became apparent that this was more serious than I first thought. Over-exercising had allowed me to push down my issues and losing sport was not only a grief in itself but it also meant that I wasn't able to forget anymore, I had to deal with my demons. ,I found it very difficult to accept what was happening to me. I was used to being numb to my emotions or at least not letting them get in my way. Now I was dealing with the idea of carrying this label of anxiety and depression everywhere I went. I felt overwhelmed, weak, powerless.,When I first told my dad about my anxiety, he said “What are you anxious about?”, and when I first informed him of my depression a few weeks later he said “I can accept the anxiety but I don’t think you’re depressed son”. It is a difficult enough journey of self-acceptance as it is, never mind feeling judged or unsupported by family or friends.,Most of my friends and family were great - my Mam is a counsellor and my girlfriend is a nurse. They understood what was going on and they talked to me with compassion. They helped me normalise how I was feeling.,To anyone who knows someone struggling with mental illness, don’t let them feel like they are “crazy” or that what they are experiencing isn’t normal. Having someone to speak to without judgement helped me feel safe and like I could actually manage. With their support I decided to challenge my dad to learn more about what was going on with me. I sent him videos, articles and books. Over time he began to accept my journey. He was scared his son might be “broken” and that he let that happen. Sometimes older generations label mental illness as being “broken”. That isn’t even close to the truth. In fact it has been the catalyst for me to open up about my struggles, to share the load and build closer bonds with my parents, friends and girlfriend. Sometimes it takes that.,My illness has encouraged me to analyse my life. Anxiety and depression have been a wakeup call. My lifestyle was burning me out. I worked myself too hard. Whenever I wasn’t working or studying, I was socialising or playing sport. I left no time to check in with myself or to talk to people about issues in my life. I created an environment for myself where personal issues could be hidden behind walls of work and activities. If I didn’t have to think about issues, did they even exist? If they didn’t exist, what was there to talk about?,It’s tough to change that thought pattern. We live in a world where working ludicrously long hours means we are “committed” or a “hard worker”. These are things that employers, teachers, parents and peers all praise. My family instilled an unhealthy work ethic in me, one that would earn me huge success and plaudits in school, sport and career, but one that burnt me out to the point of collapse. Being busy is rarely called out as a negative. It wasn’t until I went to counselling that I was questioned as to why I do so much.,Now, I’m trying to push loving myself to the top of my agenda. It’s difficult because for 90% of my life I’ve hidden from allowing myself to feel exactly what has been going on with my mental state. Be it my parent’s separation, my forced retirement from sport, heartbreaks or deaths, I suppressed it all and used activity as my therapy. Sitting with it is a lot scarier but I’m starting to feel the benefit, I’m starting to heal.,All I can say to people going through something similar is - this is scary, there is no denying that. If you can love yourself and completely experience your mental illness then you’ll be OK. Just hang in there."
"Vicki, ","I’ve struggled with mental health problems for 4 years now. I started my first year at college, being that independent person my parents always wanted me to be, but then everything just came tumbling down. My family and I all went through a very traumatic time and that’s where it all began.,I lost my way a bit. I didn’t want to go to college, I didn’t want go out and socialise like every other teenager would be doing. I locked myself away. Over the following months I found myself rapidly getting worse. I didn’t want to speak to anyone about how I was feeling, especially my family. I always felt like the glue in the family, holding everyone together, so I kept silent with my problems.,At the age of 18 I decided to move out and live on my own. At first I was loving life. Having my own place, my own pets, doing what I wanted when I wanted. Then I slowly realised how lonely I was and how much I was struggling. I was working somewhere where I was getting paid minimum wage so I couldn’t afford anything apart from just about managing to pay the bills. I pushed all my close friends away because I just didn’t want to leave the house. This is when I realised I’d slipped back into depression.,After 3 years of pretending to be this happy, bubbly, energetic character, I just broke. I was tired. Tired of pretending. I pulled myself together and reached out for help. I was finally diagnosed with ,, , and an,. I felt free in a sense, a massive weight I’d been carrying for 4 years had been lifted off of my shoulders.,Throughout the process of getting the help I needed, I heard typical comments like ‘just be happy then’, ‘stop worrying so much then and you’ll be fine’. But I also heard things like ‘I didn’t realise you were struggling so much, you hid it so well’. That was the issue, I shouldn’t have had to hide it. I wouldn’t have needed to if people had a better understanding about mental health.,I found it so difficult to admit to myself and others around me how much I was struggling. I had and still do have a brilliant support network from my partner, family and a few friends. I knew telling them would be difficult, but I also knew they love me know matter what, which I am so grateful for. It’s the rest of the world that’s scary. The lack of understanding and knowledge that people have towards those with a mental illness. If someone breaks their arm, everyone jumps to them to sign their cast. If someone has a mental health problem, people run because they think we’re unpredictable and strange.,I’ve come across a mental health champion scheme and I’m now making it my task to help people understand and talk more about their mental health. Don’t be ashamed of who you are.,People shouldn’t have to lie about taking medication. People shouldn’t have to lie about doctor or counselling appointments. Those with a mental illness should be accepted and treated the same as anyone with a physical health problem. I’ve learnt that it is ok to be a little different. It’s ok not to say you’re not ok. Everyone needs to learn that not every disability is physical. The happiest person you know in life could be the one who is also struggling the most. Make sure they’re ok. It’s time to talk and it’s time to change."
"James, ","Leading up to the day I opened up about my mental health I had struggled with , for many years. It affected me in many ways and eventually opened the door for , to come in, which would then take hold of my life for over a year. Throughout that time trying to deal with my anxiety and depression brought with it a lot of negative habits. The build-up of these bad habits would eventually get me to the point where the thought of doing something I used to enjoy would set off negative feelings about myself and my life. Now because this would repeatedly happen, I became too scared to even try and be happy for such a long time.,I lost all interest in the hobbies I would have enjoyed in the past. And this was because of that internal tug of war that I was having to go through every day. On one side I would know that I had stopped doing what I enjoyed, and it would make me feel so ashamed and angry that I was letting this get the better of me. But on the other end, if I did try to push myself to something, it would be met with immediate anxiety because I knew those feelings of guilt would soon follow.,Either way, I couldn’t win so I would be losing days and weeks due to this internal battle and by the time this had been going on for so long, I had eventually convinced myself that I didn’t deserve to be happy anymore. If I wasn’t at work, I would just spend my time stuck in this tug of war. Never giving myself the time to relax and feel truly happy.,The internal hatred I had for myself had reached what felt like a peak, but somehow still felt like it would continue to get worse. I felt lost, scared and that the potential for me to have a good life was over.,Throughout all of this, I was able to hide it from the people in my life. I would do this because I did not want to push these negative feelings on anyone else because I didn’t think anyone would take it seriously, and they have their own lives to deal with so why care about this.,However, the day I did find the courage to open up I had not planned on doing it. I was on my way to see a movie with my girlfriend. On the way there the guard I'd had up for so long to hide my internal struggles just crumbled out of the exhaustion of it all and I couldn’t hide it anymore. My girlfriend noticed something was wrong with me and I realised that I had to tell her what was going on, so a little later this is what I did.,It was very scary, and it was one of those times where I just couldn’t find the words to describe how I felt and what had been going on. I’ll admit that the guilt of passing this on to my girlfriend and my parents the next day was there. It was scary, but their incredible understanding and support made me feel safe and comfortable, something I had not felt in such a long time. Opening up to them and then my GP would be a great help for me. I am forever grateful for the overwhelming support they gave and continue to give me.,If I had not expressed how I was feeling I don’t like to think about what could have happened. But they guided me in the right direction to find myself again and experience real happiness again. It’s still a work in progress, I’m not perfect and I will sometimes make the mistakes I would do in the past. But when all is said and done, the gratitude I have for the continued support will always trump those bad days!"
"Victor, ","I was diagnosed with depression during my final year of medical school. Since then it’s been a struggle of relapses and recovery. Sharing my story makes things easier. If I tell you my experience it’s easier for you to share yours.,I remember I wrote a sort of suicide note when I was 12. At that age I self-harmed as well. I didn’t speak to anyone about how I was feeling. What was I going to say? ,That was the first time I started feeling something wasn’t right, but I didn’t know what it was. Even at medical school, I still couldn’t figure it out.,I didn’t go to see the doctor out of choice. I was talked into it by my friends. I always think I’m one of the lucky ones - I had friends who knew the signs of depression. A large percentage of Nigerians don’t have access to people who can help them at the early stages of their illness. Most people have to really get in a very bad state to get help.,My diagnosis has helped me to accept what’s going on. All I asked for from my friends was to be treated the same way. I'm not fragile - I didn’t want to be treated like an egg. ,I founded an organisation, ,. ,In Nigeria we have so many issues with people resorting to spiritual means, cultural practices and traditional mental health healing centres.,When stigma exists, discrimination happens. People don’t want to be associated with anybody that has anything to do with mental health issues.,We try to make people understand when we talk about mental health issues, this spans from depression, which is not even seen in Nigeria as a mental health issue - to schizophrenia, which is seen as a ‘curse’. ,Support from family and peers makes recovery possible. Society has the power to help you accept your diagnosis and seek help. If we create environments where people know its fine to talk about mental health, help-seeking becomes easy. People realise they can walk into a psychiatric hospital without being tagged, ‘mad’. Most people who come to a psychiatric specialist travel from far away to avoid being seen by their neighbours.,The stories we were told by our parents and their parents before them affect how we perceive mental health now.,If you want to get married your parents do a lot of research into your partner and their family just to find out if anyone has had mental health issues. If there has been, they’ll call off the wedding. This still happens even in this day and age.,People believe if someone has mental health issues, they have been cursed. Or people say the person is not in tune with their God. Or they’ve done something really evil. Everything is blamed on mental health.,In politics, if someone does something bad, people say, “that person is mad, get him checked out.” Because society says mentally ill people are crazy and they do all the bad things in society, it is hard for someone like me to accept, actually I am mentally ill. ,The discussions are increasing, especially among young people. We are seeing a change. We know a lot of young people have issues to deal with and we know they are interested in speaking about it and now they know there’s a community that accepts them.,We’ve had people who’ve called to say they don’t want it on their employment record that they have a mental health issue. They ask us to recommend a psychiatric hospital they can go to which won’t record this. Even if it means they have to pay out of pocket.,We hear from people who have had to deal with it in psychiatric hospitals where even the doctors have stigmatising attitudes. Some therapists tell people, “why don’t you just get better – you’re too young to be mentally ill.” Some psychiatrists let their spirituality influence them. They’ll tell a patient, “I have a pastor who can help you”. ,You find more Nigerians in churches and mosques than anywhere else. Especially in rural areas, churches can be very judgemental about mental health. They say, ‘a child of God has no business being depressed’. You end up feeling worse. Now even your church, which is supposed to be a support, doesn’t accept you. You’re told you’ve let the devil in and that’s why you’re coping with the darkness of depression. ,Churches and mosques are such important communities. We want to have conversations with these influential people and ask them, do you think mental health is just a spiritual issue? We don’t want to dismiss the spiritual totally because if you do that you won’t get anywhere. We need to see how we can combine both spiritual and medical recommendations to make sure people get help.,Across Africa we have the same sort of issues when it comes to stigma. African parents’ way of raising their children often relies on fear. There is a lack of communication. Children and teenagers are not listened to which makes mental health issues worse.,Children of 10, 11 and 12 have told me their parents are going to take them for deliverance sessions or to the mountain for prayers or exorcism because they think they’re possessed rather than mentally ill. Parents need to be friends with their kids so they can talk about mental health.,At MANI, we know working with young people can help change attitudes towards mental health.,..."
"Charlotte, "," and , is a part of my life. I recognise now that it has been for the majority of my life. But it took a long time for me to realise and accept this. I didn't want to be ""ill"". The stigma surrounding mental illness was built within me, passed down through generations of people ""pulling themselves together"". I'd hear some of those close to me talk about victims of suicide, they would reflect on stories they had heard and use words like selfish and crazy. I remember feeling so much empathy and pain at those words. I understood feeling like my family would be better off without me. Like there wasn't going to be a future that I could play a part in. I thought that was my fault, I thought I was “selfish” too.,It wasn't until I was 18 and at university that I knew it wasn't just ""teenage blues"" and I wasn't ""shy and one day you'll grow out it"". I had reached the point in my life where I finally felt some independence. It slowly dawned on me (with the help of a lot of online research, cheers Google), the sweaty, breathy unsuccessful attempts to walk through the door of my uni seminars and the eventual slow tearful walk back to halls, were not just because I was ""shy"". Neither was my ""awkwardness” the reason I would have to ring my friends to come and open their front door, when I arrived at their house, for crippling fear of knocking and not knowing who could be behind it when it opened, having not planned out precisely what I would say and then freeze unable to articulate myself.,I would sleep through the daylight, not eating, not doing anything, just being trapped to the spot and drifting in and out of consciousness. That wasn't because I was ""lazy"". I wasn't just ""heartbroken"" because my boyfriend and I broke up. I was depressed and self-sabotaging, misusing substances and driving people away because I felt unworthy and broken.,Some of them did walk away but some stuck around and I'm thankful for both because I know it's difficult to support someone who is unable to admit there is something wrong. The fear of ridicule or claims of ""attention seeking"" made it feel impossible.,Right now I feel incredibly supported but that hasn't always been the case. It's been about 10 years from my initial realisation and I can see things are shifting slowly (due to campaigns like Time to Change). Mental health is being discussed on the news, people are coming forward with their stories and I no longer feel shame for my struggles but we've still got a lot of work to do.,It took me 10 years to build up the courage and support to get a diagnosis and start on a road to recovery but that wasn't for lack of trying. At times of crisis, I went to those closest to me, I broke down to them to be told to ""get a grip"" or ""just try and be happy"".,A couple of hours before I got my diagnosis I was asked by a relative ""Are you sure you want to do this? It will be on your medical records, people will make assumptions about you, it might affect your job prospects"". I was furious. It had taken so much fight and feelings of guilt to get to a point where I was ready, I’d felt I had the support of my family, that they finally took me seriously.,However, on this occasion, I'm glad they asked me that question because I defied it, it stuck with me and I found strength from within it. Now I talk openly about depression and anxiety. I ask the people around me how they are and then I ask them again. I still see members of my family wince when the neighbour pops over for a cup of tea and asks how I am and what I've been up to. I answer them honestly and await the awkward silence but I also see how proud they are of me for challenging that stigma and for how far I've come. I still dread those kinds of questions some days.,I want the people that have touched on those feelings of nothingness or pain, the people who feel it totally consumes them and the people who blow it off as us being ""snowflakes"", to know our feelings are legitimate, we all deserve to be listened to and we are all in this together."
"Sophie, ","To describe what living with , and , is like to anyone who doesn't understand or hasn't experienced it before is to imagine a weight pulling your body down, so heavy that every day you have to summon up the strength to push against it and to lighten the impact. Some days I'm just about able to ease it off a little and get on with the things I need to; there's still a strain there but it's manageable and I can stave it off for a little while if I’m distracted.,However, other times I just don't have the strength and energy to push against it and I feel powerless, completely worn down and unable to move forward. That's what it feels like for me, so intense and so unavoidable.,Of course you can't actually 'see' depression and anxiety the way you might do a physical ailment on the body. On the surface, I smile and talk about the normal things you're supposed to talk about with others and answer 'how are you?' with the expected 'fine thank you, and yourself?'. It can feel like to tell someone you're struggling is to place a massive burden on them, to make them feel uncomfortable, or even worse, there's the fear that it will make them walk away from you.,And whilst if the tables were turned and a friend was telling me they were struggling I wouldn't think any of those things, depression and anxiety can make you second-guess everything and feel unworthy of compassion and understanding from others. What people don't see are the days when leaving the house seems like an impossible feat, when just the process of getting dressed is exhausting and distressing, the days where I can't seem to stop crying, when sleeping is the only way to get away from my thoughts, or alternatively when I feel numb.,Being depressed isn't something that anyone chooses or something that can be solved just by thinking positively (as nice as that would be!). The reality is that you can be a positive person but be consumed by mental illness; you can be seemingly 'fine' on the surface but may have spent hours and hours trying to work up the courage to face another human, even if that’s just going to the corner shop or the post office.,It’s debilitating and complex and no one experience is the same, but we're trying really really hard. There’s no one-size-fits-all when it comes to treatment either. Medication becomes a game of trial and error and quite often the combination of meds and talking therapy is more beneficial; I’ve found that it’s a process of figuring out what works for you.,Because of my personal experiences, like many others, supporting campaigns such as Time to Change are so important to me. For a long time I’ve worked hard to conceal my struggles from the people around me, but being passionate about wanting there to be more understanding and empathy around mental health issues, writing this feels like a small step in the right direction."
"Caitlin, ","I’ve always been rather private when it comes to my mental health. In 2019 I am willing to change that. I really wish mental health wasn’t such a taboo subject and that people did not feel ashamed to speak of their struggles, because it’s not our fault. But that’s the issue with mental illnesses, they cause you to overthink and you end up thinking it is your fault. It’s not.,I owe a lot to my counsellor (who has dealt with me week in and week out for over two years). I think that it’s important to stop antidepressants and counselling being such a taboo topic. People are ashamed to admit that they take these daily, or are ashamed to even ask for them. I have been on antidepressants for five months now and when I was placed on them, I was too scared to even tell some of my closest friends because I was scared of being judged. It’s important to recognise that pills aren’t a magic cure for mental illnesses, but that they can help motivate you to take the steps toward feeling better.,As a society we need a better approach toward mental health and we need to stop making assumptions. For one, mental illness is different for everyone. Not everyone experiences it in the same way. That also means that people’s problems should not be dismissed just because they don’t present them in the typical form that we expect. Someone can have , but go on a stage in front of thousands. They have overcome the fear, but it doesn’t mean that their anxiety doesn’t exist, or it is less important than someone else’s.,Someone can have depression but spend their day laughing and smiling. People with , can have good days too, and they’re also great at faking a smile for the benefit of those around them.,You may think someone is “fine” because they’re posting on social media, but social media is fake. It’s usually a presentation of the best parts of our lives and very rarely includes the worst parts.,We also need to stop saying things such as “it could be worse”, “you’re overreacting”, “get over it” or “snap out of it”. These are the kinds of statements which tick over and over in people’s minds and can lead them to think that they shouldn’t speak up. People are afraid of judgement. Don’t make people feel as though they are being judged.,We need to stop saying that people are “attention seeking”, because speaking about your struggles is something that most people find very difficult to do. As someone who struggles a lot with anxiety issues, I often feel I am being judged when in retrospect it may have been a harmless comment. It is so important to be kind to anyone, at any chance you get, because you have no idea how much your words and actions can impact a person’s mental state. This goes for both positive and negative acts or comments, they can both have a lasting impact.,Oh and PLEASE, if you notice someone has scars or wounds which you believe may have been caused by self-harm, do not ask them about it in public. By all means, ask if they’re doing okay, but do it in a one on one situation. Asking someone about this topic when they’re with a group of people is likely to make them clam up, not start a conversation about it which could help them get the help they need.,If you think someone is struggling mentally, just check they’re okay, let them know they matter to you. And to anyone struggling, it is OKAY to want to be alone, alone time can be great , but being in a comfortable environment with friends and family can do a lot of good as well.,A simple “how are you doing?” can go a long way, to let someone know that you are thinking of them. You don’t have to understand what they’re going through, you just need to be there for them. ,And if someone tries to open up to you, let them. Sometimes they don’t even need you to say anything, they just need to feel like someone is listening and they care.,I hope that everyone, and I mean everyone, not just my close friends, knows that I am here. I know it is an overused statement but I truly mean it. I admit I’m not always great at giving advice but I take myself for a great listener. Don’t be afraid to speak up."
"Rosalind, ","It’s interesting trying to explain the agony that , brought into my life to people who are not depressed. I find that people who haven’t fought that particular battle have difficulty understanding what I mean when I say I was not in physical pain per se but I was in excruciating torment nonetheless. Physically, I’m sure my body showed no signs of peril.,And publicly, I never let my guard down for fear of judgement. But emotionally, I was aflame with terror and self-hatred. As someone who has struggled with eating disorders and anxiety since I was twelve, I am somewhat used to intense personal turmoil. Depression was something else. It was as if there was a cavity in my soul that was sore and inflamed with sorrow and loneliness. I had to clutch myself, my arms wrapped tightly around my torso, to keep from disintegrating. It was as if I had been punched in the chest by an iron-clad fist. A hole in my heart yearned for healing and love. And after so many years of fighting to make my body smaller, more frail, devoid of life, I was stunned to once again realize that the option of death seemed more logical than any attempt at life. Reason failed in that moment. Depression’s perversion of reality trumped the truth.,I did not take my life. I survived the moment where I was my most lethal enemy. But whenever I try to tell people about what happened, they don’t seem to understand where my desire to end the pain would come from, unless they also have fought mental health battles. The power of depression is remarkable. It can effectively convince you that despite your connections, your family, your ability, or your friends, you are worthless and alone in the world, that you will never be loveable, and that your existence is a colossal mistake. I want others who don’t battle depression to understand that you will never be able to tell that someone is depressed just by looking at them. I hid my struggle so well that my own family, a loving, wonderful support system, were blindsided. Making the disease invisible was a personal pride of mine, because then I could convince the world that I was not weak or pathetic.,The stereotypes of people with depression are extensive. They range from people not being able to get out of bed, shower, eat, or leave their house. And while these are definite truths for some people, depression is like snowflakes: No two are the same. My depression has its own ways of manifesting itself in my behaviours and thoughts. But someone else’s could be the polar opposite. Which makes neither more or less valid than the other.,Asking for help does not make a person feeble. In fact, it does the opposite. It fortifies you. It demonstrates your willingness to fight for yourself. It makes you the hero of your own story. One day, I hope we can unite on the idea that depression is not a disgraceful condition. And for people who do not experience depression but may know someone who does, be a friend to them. Be gentle and patient. They are fighting every day to overcome an invisible barrier. You don’t have to understand what they’re feeling, just that a little empathy can go a long way.,I no longer carry shame for what I experience. I hope many others do in the future so that isolation due to mental health might one day be an object of the past."
"Holly, ","I remember the first time I vocalised and admitted the fact that I was struggling with , and ,. Following seven years of sporadic periods of chronic anxiety and panic attacks induced by both smoking marijuana as a teenager and my parents’ break up, I was at university, 22 and suffering a reactive bout of depression triggered by the break-up of a tumultuous relationship.,The university referred me to a counsellor and during my first session, I cried and cried. I felt incredibly exposed and ashamed about how I felt and for the way in which I was dealing with anything disrupting my life and mental health. He ultimately delved very directly into my childhood, where my issues and insecurities may have stemmed from. My father’s affair and subsequent parental divorce, the breakdown of my family unit and loss of my childhood home, my own striving for aesthetic perfection (after being put on a pedestal to perform and entertain by my well-meaning parents), my body dysmorphia disorder and my anxious outlook on the world stemming from an over protective parent all arose.,It was a minefield of information and facts, which were both overwhelming and numbing. Slowly I started to process and understand how immediate circumstances, upbringing and ingrained deep-seated damage all contributed towards the way I felt in general, and how I reacted to certain situations. Fifteen years later, this is still a work in progress!,Many of my early mental health conversations actually took place with my wise, incredibly open and beloved late grandmother, following my counselling. Not only were we very close, she was also not a direct parent and slightly removed from my household so she could give me a more objective viewpoint. Despite our 58-year age gap, she had the mind and attitudes of a person of my age and even though she never professed to having suffered from much emotional strain in her life, she was an empath and very interested in psychology / anthropology. She listened and gave measured, kind advice and allowed me to talk without interruption.,Because of how this made me feel, I am now especially keen to encourage others to talk, and embrace the benefit of being open and unashamed. Just by being open, intuitive, sensitive and encouraging, people without mental health problems can provide a safe platform for others - friends / family / colleagues - to open up when may not have done so if nobody had recognised their behaviours, signs and symptoms. I always reach out if I sense or see that someone is in need, and give them the option to talk to me if they so wish. I know how important and meaningful this is to some who feel they do not want to burden others with their ‘problems’ having been on the other side of it.,I still get bouts of the black dog and I feel it is important to recognise if there are any catalysts or triggers (including hormones) and this makes it easier to understand and thus to work through. Talking in small social groups, a phone call with a friend or writing down how I feel all help me to ‘emotionally vomit’ or ‘do a wee out of my eyes’. I draw these humorous yet strangely accurate comparisons to being poorly with food poisoning or a bug, or needing the loo – the toxins need to exit the body in order for you to begin your physical recovery. It is no different with emotional illness. I refer to the latter particularly when people need to cry and try to stifle it. It is important to listen to one’s body. Humour and self-deprecation often help me to help others and myself… of course considering another person’s boundaries and approaching things with discretion and sensitivity.,Trying to break down a mass of issues into individual challenges rather than perceiving things as one huge lump of problem also really helps.,There has been far too much stigma attached to admitting we are struggling with our mental health, let alone opening up enough to talk about it. It is positive to reason out and rationalise things with others; and ourselves - verbally or written. This is especially important when people are not struggling with a mental health problem to be educated and familiarised with the concept; the reality that so many have to live often form an hour-to-hour basis just to get through. There are still barriers to mental health whether it be ignorance, lack of information and understanding or lack of first-hand experience but I am confident that day by day, week by week, month by month and year by year this is dissipating within society.,Now I have opened my can of metaphorical brain worms, I will never seal it again."
"Lottie, "," has been a part of my life for over 10 years; yet I still don’t fully understand it. So, how do I explain what “it” is to someone who has no experience of depression in their life?,
In all honesty, I’ve rarely been asked to explain what depression means to me. You say the word and people either turn away in fear or they try to relate in attempts to console and/or fill the silence. When really, all I need is for someone to ask “And how does depression affect you?”.,
Depression, for me, is another soul taking over my mind and body. It cohabits day in day out in attempts to knock my confidence, whispering insults in my ear. And I can live with this; I know it is a part of me and I’m grateful to merely exist – so if I have to share with depression then so be it.,
The struggle comes when depression really takes over, and I forget my strength, vitality and the love I have for those around me. Every word, action, or passing glance is an attack. My body aches and all I want to do is sleep until the pain goes away. If someone tries to ask me how I’m feeling or what’s going on in my head, I can’t answer them. I become so overwhelmed by the pure negativity that I shut down to protect myself.,
In the first few years, my coping mechanism was ,. I didn’t do it to “feel something” or to punish myself. I self-harmed so that the pain would stop – in the brief moments afterwards I felt a sense of calm and control. This was fleeting, and as with any addiction, I needed more of it to achieve the same results. Before long I was hurting myself “just because” and to this day there are months of my life that I cannot remember – my brain has shut off the memories because they are too harmful.,
The scars act as a reminder that I may have lost some battles, but I’m winning the war. When strangers stare in confusion, or whisper to their friend who turns in shock – it hurts. I vividly remember parties when other girls would gather, laughing and pointing – the world can be a cruel place. But when someone approaches me with kindness and asks about my scars, I feel hopeful, and explain that “I have depression and that’s how I used to cope, but I’m okay now”.,Kind words can open the door to a conversation that not only helps me to understand my depression, but potentially helps others to understand it too.,If you know someone who might be struggling, I ask that you give them your time and patience...,Depression makes me feel worthless, insignificant and burdensome, I won't ask you for help, because I don't have the strength. Please could you sit down with me, and let me know that you are 'here'? I might not be able to talk about feelings, but ask ""how do you feel today?"" and I'd know that you care.,Please don't be offended when I don't respond - sometimes the only way of coping is to shut you, and everything else, out. I might snap back at you, or say ""I'm fine""; when we both know that's not true. Stay with me, even in silence, tears, anger and irritation - don't ask ""Why? What? How? When?"" Just tell me you're here when I'm ready to talk, and maybe one day I can.,Find something that brings me back to moment, and allows me to escape (however briefly) the depression. My favourite food, film, a walk with the dogs, making plans for the holidays, a tub of Ben & Jerry's! Hope that I might be able to share what's going on in my head - but give me time, don't push for answers. Ask what I need from you, and one day I might know.,If each person reading this held out their hand to someone in pain, it might start the conversation that helps, even just a little bit."
"Dina, ","Many people might think of a period of poor mental health as being incapable of getting out of bed in the morning, or a severe lack of motivation and reluctance to do anything. Certainly, for many people these symptoms are prominent at times.,However, some who are living with a mental illness, or generally struggling with mental health, are high-functioning. They still live out their day-to-day lives like normal. They go to work, socialise, and function like anyone else.,Unfortunately, because they seem perfectly ‘normal’ on the outside, when they choose to be open about their mental health, they’re often met with the phrase, ‘you can’t be dealing with that much if you’re still able to get out of bed in the morning’.,A terribly frustrating sentence that I, as someone who is high-functioning, and others with similar conditions hear far too often. Although I’m sure (well, I hope!) these comments aren’t intended to cause harm, and likely descend from ignorance around mental health in general, they really need to stop.,Having a high-functioning mental illness does not put you in a category above others dealing with mental health. It doesn’t mean you’ve got a strong grasp of your condition and understand how to manage it. It doesn’t mean your struggles are less than those who cannot function in the same way, and of course doesn’t mean yours are worse. Everyone’s issues are relative.,What it does mean is that you are trying to get on with your day, doing your best, all the while struggling to keep the impending anxiety, depression or other mental health issues hidden away.,I remember in 2016, I had an assessment with a mental health practitioner to discuss types of therapy I might benefit from.,During the assessment, I was asked a series of questions around how my mental health affects me on a day-to-day basis. I remember half way through the assessment she said, ‘So what help do you need exactly? People with mental health issues can barely get themselves out of the house, they have no motivation to do anything. Are you sure you’re not just having a bad few weeks?’. I understand she’s the professional, but unfortunately, she completely invalidated my mental wellbeing.,I panicked and immediately started backtracking. I felt like I had to lie about my symptoms because they didn’t seem ‘good’ or ‘correct’ enough to actually get any help, and that I was stupid for finally taking steps to get help.,Now of course, I’m not saying all mental health practitioners are like this; it’s just that in this instance, I didn’t have the best experience.,Thankfully, I pushed forward and was put on a waiting list to receive some help. Flash forward a few years and I was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Depression and Generalised Anxiety Disorder.,What if I walked away from that assessment? Accepting that I had to have x, y and z as symptoms in order to be valid in what I was feeling? I might have continued living with mental health conditions that I didn’t understand, and no idea that I needed help.,From speaking to many who live with mental health issues and are high-functioning, I discovered that feeling invalidated is a common theme.,The stigma is slowly breaking as more of us are speaking out. I believe it’s incredibly important we erase this idea that you must behave in certain ways or display specific types of emotions and symptoms to truly have a mental health issue.,Every single person on this planet is unique, and so is their experience with mental health. If I was put in a room with several different people who had been diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder, we wouldn’t all behave in the same ways. It doesn’t mean each symptom associated with this mental illness will affect each and every one of us in the same way. The same applies to any mental health issue or illness.,I think we need to challenge the idea that we must tick a stereotypical box to have a ‘real’ mental health problem. Let’s not dismiss those who share their struggles, even if it seems they are functioning. I believe we have to stop invalidating people because we are conditioned to assume mental health appears a certain way, and we have to continue breaking the stigma."
"Tara, ","A couple of years ago I was diagnosed with , (BPD). When the symptoms and potential causes were described to me it made a lot of sense and in hindsight this is something that has followed me since my childhood.,An unwillingness to seek help due to fear and shame meant I wasn’t diagnosed until I had turned 30, had a few failed suicide attempts under my belt and a history of self-harm and eating disorders.,
 ,
It took me a while to come to terms with my diagnosis and I continued to keep it secret for a pretty long time. I’d had a lifetime of keeping my issues a secret and it hadn’t got me anywhere. But by opening up to medical professionals I was finally getting some support.,So I decided to try to be more open with other people in my life. But it’s hard opening up; it takes guts to tell someone about the thing you hate most about yourself – so their reaction means everything! At its best opening up can leave you feeling empowered, heard and hopeful, but at its worst it causes real damage. ,I try not to focus on the bad experiences, but it’s a struggle not to. When I hit a rough patch a while back and needed some support from a previous employer I had an experience that really scarred me. ,
 ,
I was in the midst of a prolonged period of , and my , levels were sky high. I spoke to my manager about it as I was getting increasingly worried about my low mood and ability to balance my workload. When my anxiety is at its worst I struggle to make even the simplest of decisions, I agonise over every possible option and outcome and it can make being productive at work impossible. ,
 ,
When I told my manager that I was struggling with depression and anxiety their first response was to make a joke about it: “well, we’d better get you carted off to the loony bin then”. At least I think this was an attempt at a joke, if it was it didn’t land!,
 ,
This crushed me. I felt stupid and ashamed, but perhaps worst of all I felt like I couldn’t rely on my workplace for support when I needed it. There were countless other occasions where my manager made jokes about my mental health, both when it was just the two of us and in front of my colleagues. ,When I requested to work from home on days that I didn’t feel well enough to commute and be surrounded by people all day - but I felt able to work – I was told no, I’d have to take sick days instead.,
 ,
So, I kept working, I kept ignoring my body and mind when it was on the verge of spiralling, until eventually I ended up at rock bottom. I couldn’t leave my bed, let alone my house. I was consumed with impulsive and harmful thoughts about hurting myself or ending my life. I was signed off from work for six weeks, had a few emergency trips to hospital and was put under the care of my community mental health team.,When I came back to work (because I wouldn’t get sick pay if I was off any longer) I was immediately given a formal disciplinary for being off sick, despite having a letter from my GP.,
 ,
Shortly after returning to work a new manager started. I thought things might get better, but they became worse. My new manager had a similar approach to dealing with people with mental health problems as the last one. They made jokes and mean remarks, and at one point I was taken aside and told “I heard rumours you’re a self-harmer and tried to kill yourself, if that’s true you need to tell me”. ,
 ,
At the time I was a manager myself, and I still am, and I can’t understand how so many managers could have such a poor understanding of mental health and lack even the ability to treat someone with compassion and understanding. I’m hoping I was just unlucky and that others aren’t getting the same treatment when they tell their employer about their mental health problems, but I imagine I’m not alone.,
 ,
I have since moved roles and now work somewhere that I can be open about my mental health, work flexible hours so I can make my therapy appointments and take some space when I need it. The best thing is feeling able to talk frankly about how I am feeling without the fear of being stigmatised. Being open is still a work in progress but every day it gets a little easier.,
 ,
Before I left, I recommended that my employer provide some training for managers on how to manage people who have a mental illness, or just how to compassionately support people when they are having a hard time! I also referred them to the resources on the Time to Change website – I’d like to think that they used this but who knows., "
"Anita, ","I had never heard of the word anxiety. I had heard of depression but didn’t understand it, and at that point, I never thought it would hit me.,In 2012 I graduated with a 2:1 degree, made amazing friends and I was working for a company I loved. Unfortunately, things didn’t work out where I was working and I decided to leave my job and search for another one. It was a hard decision walking away from the company I loved but I knew I had my education and experience on my side.,In February 2013 I attended a football match, I was the biggest football fan in the world! I watched games from all different leagues regardless of who was playing, but visiting this particular stadium was a big part of my life, it was like a dream. What I didn’t realise was I was gaining anxiety. I was sat in high seats and had an overwhelming feeling, I had no idea what this was - all I knew was that I felt light-headed continuously, which lead to me experiencing my first ’fight-or-flight’ sensation. I ran to the closest tube station and went home confused and emotional.,After this episode, things just got worse. I didn’t leave the house, I constantly felt paranoid and emotional, my confidence had completely gone. I become completely unsociable. I was unemployed and applying for at least 10 jobs a day doing anything.,It took someone close to me to see the signs of depression. My idea of depression was an older person who had lost everything, not someone who’s just graduated from university with their whole life ahead of them. This goes to show mental health can impact anyone at any age, at any stage of their life.,I was lucky - I gained medical help and eventually got a local job at the same time. The hardest thing I had to do was tell my new boss I had a mental health issue. There's a lot of negative stigma surrounding mental health, especially in the Asian community, but I was lucky I had an understanding manager and team who helped me gain my confidence back.,I eventually went back to work in the career I loved but I still wasn’t myself. I was quiet, I had no confidence and had to do ‘rituals’ to get me through the day. For example, I would sit and do exercises from my desk to keep my mind occupied and anxiety down.,This is where I believe understanding of mental health in the workplace is severely lacking. Looking back, it also shows how untrained my manager was; advising a colleague ‘try to make her more talkative’ was the wrong approach. Hopefully, in time there will be a movement towards ‘we have a new starter who isn’t settling in too well, let me see how she’s adapting to change’, and more understanding about anxiety and depression.,Luckily, I met someone who I was able to open up to, and this was the real start of my recovery. I felt comfortable confiding in what I had been through and how I felt. Instead of thinking, “I’m taking a risk and being judged”, I felt I could comfortably be myself again.,The conversations didn’t feel difficult; it felt like a genuine conversation where I could talk about my stress and anxieties. I gained my confidence back and become sociable. Importantly, I become happy again, and I started travelling which I would never have done without having someone to confide my fears in.,The biggest achievement was going back to passion, my football. Never did I think I would ever attend a football match again in my life - and here I was sitting among 90,000 people at Wembley.,I thought my anxiety and depression were beyond me…but they came back. The difference this time was that I knew what anxiety and depression were, I knew what was going to happen, but most importantly I knew I wanted to fight this.,I did slip down a bad path and my behaviours and actions were not me at all. However, I was open and honest to my friend who helped me through before, and it helped me realise I had motives to continue and get back to being myself.,This is when I decided to become a mental health first aider. Since I've been open about my mental health difficulties, people have been able to open up to me in the same way I was able to open up to my friend. For that reason, all the training I have done has been worth it.,I believe we still have a long way to go for society to understand how to deal with mental health, but there is positive movement towards better mental health awareness."
"Nadia, ","I was told that my reason for being depressed was “pathetic”, and that I “had plenty of things going” for myself, but depression doesn’t work like that. It doesn’t look at what you have going on in life and avoid you because it doesn’t want to ruin that. ,I wanted the people I care for and confided in to open their hearts and minds to understand that depression isn’t a choice. I didn’t want to be depressed - nobody wants to be depressed. ,Being told I was wrong for being depressed, made me feel even more hopeless and incapable of overcoming it with the ‘’weak mind’’ that I was being told I had. I felt like a burden to those I cared about and as if I had let my family and friends down, for letting what was considered “a bad mood” get the better of me. I was told that I had a history of being depressed for so long, that I’d probably be depressed forever - and that it was only a matter of time till there would be another thing that happened to trigger it all over again.,When I sought therapy to prevent that from happening, the person I trusted enough to confide in made me feel like my reasons weren’t worthy enough to seek professional help over; they would have been able to get over it all easily or not let it bother them.,However, I still went to therapy, and it wasn’t a pointless road to go down. My reasons were just as valid as anyone else’s, and without help, my mind would have been stuck in the same place forever and the hopeless thoughts would have taken over me. It took strength to battle my depression and courage to grab the bull by the horns.,I think it’s easy for someone who has no experience with it personally, to assume that people who are depressed or experiencing thoughts of suicide are weak - but that’s wrong. They aren’t weak, they are alone in their thoughts and tired of battling it till they’ve lost their ability to think. I think it’s important to let people experiencing suicidal thoughts or any level of depression know they are not alone and give them positive energy to feed off. Show them that there is support available and there is still beauty in life!  Even if you don’t understand or can’t relate to people in these positions, it can help just to listen.,If you suffer with your mental health or know anyone who does, remember that depression can start at any time and can happen to anyone. No one is immune to mental health issues like anxiety and depression, and what triggers you may or may not be the same as what triggers someone else. You’re still strong and there’s still a solution to the problem. It can be cured.,I want others who are struggling with their mental health to trust that there’s light at the end of the tunnel and to encourage themselves to face the reality of how they are feeling. Accept that it’s not anything to be ashamed of – and it can be overcome."
"Sorayya, ","Mental health awareness is being raised everywhere at the moment. It is a vital step towards ending the stigma surrounding mental health. There is still a lot of work to be done, but it is a start. Stigma is still out there and it is silencing people struggling who need our help!,
I spent a lot of my adolescence numbing the pain. I'd get wasted most nights, it meant I didn't have to face the reality of my existence and the 1001 thoughts running through my head would be temporarily slowed down. I was on top of the world, the sadness and pain would be pushed down but then the hangover would kick in.,I actually did try to reach out for help. I remember standing in front of the people who society tells you would help you no matter what and saying what I did and why. The response: uncomfortable glances and shifting and ,. Then it was buried and to this day no one has ever mentioned it. Once, I asked to see a counsellor and even went to the doctors to get the ball rolling. But because I felt completely unsupported and isolated from those closest to me I couldn’t go through with it.,Those experiences made me feel ashamed and that I had to keep my mouth shut. I felt that I should never burden others with my problems or make them uncomfortable. I was made to feel that someone more important had it worse than me and they were the priority and I was the problem.,I remember feeling terrified whilst uttering the words and terrified that someone knew my secret. I learnt to smile on the outside and fall apart on the inside. And no, I was not an addict. I only did this when my illness showed up, hung about and refused to leave. I was self-destructive and thought I deserved what was happening to me.,
Mental illness stigma can make things worse for those struggling and can delay or impede them getting the help they need. The misconceptions still exist that people with mental health problems are dangerous, violent, criminal and unable to live a ""normal"" life. The media often doesn't help with these views either.,
Here are some of the things that have been said to me, and people I know, when struggling with a mental health problem.,
The list could go on......,
Unhelpful and harmful comments like these are still being said to people who get up every morning and dread facing another day.,If you're sat there gossiping about Susan who has had it rough lately but needs to pull herself together and get over it, then you're belittling someone’s mental health. The person you're speaking to could be struggling in silence and you are reinforcing their belief that they should be.,The advice of opening up and asking for help is well meant. But we don’t want to be a burden. The shame and guilt are overwhelming; the fear of being rejected is suffocating. Being thought of as selfish and believing them, being made to feel worthless and struggling in silence is hell. Yet being belittled and having every bad thought confirmed isn’t any better., can have a bad end game. People never really understand that until it happens. More than one life is affected when it does happen and there aren’t always signs. Yet if there is even the slightest hint that someone is struggling or if they have outright told you, then step up. There is no shame in having a mental illness. Don’t wait until someone’s asking for help. Someone struggling with a mental health problem may never ask, not because they expect your help, or don’t want it, but because they don’t want to burden you.,The world still needs to catch up. Hidden illnesses are still illnesses and no matter what they are, these people deserve empathy and understanding. Think before you speak.,One of the best ways to challenge the stigma, is to talk to or hear from people with experience of mental health problems. Be part of the solution."
"Nayena, ","Hi I’m Nayena, a young champion for Time To Change. I love writing, art, and music. Nothing makes me happier than good vegan food. My friends say I’m a calm, witty, and positive person. I’ve also been diagnosed with , and ,. For too long, I’ve been terrified of speaking out about my mental health. But here I am, telling my story.,What’s changed? Mostly, I have accepted myself. I’m not ashamed of my depression, nor my anorexia. I refuse to feel shame for something that has sculpted my life, widened my horizons, and shown me to be stronger than I ever thought possible. Yes, mental illness is awful, but it has made me the person I am today - I have met so many incredible people and I have discovered a passion for mental health activism that has opened so many doors for me.,Mental illness does not discriminate. It can affect anyone, whether you’re a person of colour or white or gay or trans or male or female.,You were likely surprised by my diagnosis of anorexia, due to the very specific picture of the disorder portrayed in media. Unlike the image of anorexia so often represented, I am a person of colour. Unlike the image of anorexia so often represented, I don’t look emaciated. Unlike the image of anorexia so often represented, I never did. But I had my struggle, and it was made unnecessarily harder by people who were too blinded by their own ideas of anorexia to fight for me. Friends, family, therapists: none of them took me seriously until it was very nearly too late.,My disordered eating started when I was 13, as a way of coping with a world that I felt I didn’t belong in. It worsened for two years before someone reached out to me. Those were the most isolating and exhausting two years of my life.,At first, I convinced myself my fear of food was nothing to worry about, purely because of the internalised stigma I had surrounding eating disorders. I thought eating disorders couldn’t happen to people like me, much less deserve help when they were suffered by people like me. When I thought of anorexia, I thought of young, white, skinny teenage girls who took a diet too far and landed themselves in hospital. While that may be one story, it is one of millions. And somewhere in the millions of stories is mine.,When I became ill with anorexia, I was not trying out a diet. I did not make a decision one day to just ‘stop eating’. I didn’t ever go to hospital. When I became ill with anorexia, it was a way of coping. I was extremely depressed, although didn’t know this at the time. My home life was unstable, and I clung to this illness with all I had. I did all I could to ensure my family didn’t notice, and although my school friends noticed, they said nothing. They were too blinded by their own idea of what an eating disorder looked like, and dismissed mine for a long time. After a year or so I realised I had a problem, but still didn’t believe I was sick enough to seek help.,The reason no-one noticed my eating disorder is that to the outside world, I just looked ‘healthy’.,I was praised by my friends for my willpower to exercise every day without fail and never touch junk food. I looked a healthy weight, was technically a ‘healthy weight’ (whatever that means), and yet I would faint whilst working out and fall over if I stood up too quickly. I looked healthy and yet I was a shell of a person, whose life revolved around calorie counting and obsessively exercising. I have vivid memories of my legs shaking as I walked into the exam hall to do my GCSEs - not because I was anxious, but because every step further took energy my body no longer had. All I could think about was food. At my lowest, I was suicidal, self-harming, spending weeks in bed. It was a time of my life that is so odd to think about because I was not myself at all. The memories are so vivid but they don’t feel like they are my own. I was really, very lost. What has stuck with me, this entire time, is this feeling of invalidity. This feeling of not being ‘sick enough’.,After years of struggling, in early 2018 I finally decided I was sick of being sick. I decided I would give recovery my best shot and see where it took me. Where it has taken me has been incredible. I would love to tell you that I woke up the next morning and did yoga and everything’s been fine since, but that is not the reality of recovery. I live with my depression every day and my eating disorder is still always there. I am a firm believer that things don’t just get better, but that you get better at dealing with them. I am infinitely stronger than I believed myself to be a few years ago. I have grown so much, I have learnt so much, I have laughed so much. Recovery for me is still struggling sometimes but knowing that I can pick myself back up again the next morning.,My message for Eating Disorders Awareness Week is that you are ‘sick enough’, the moment you do not feel 100%. There is no measure that can determine whether you need help; only you know how you feel and what would help you. And sometimes, you don’t even know what would help. But acknowledging and expressing how you feel is invaluable.,What did help, for me? A combination of things: therapy, medication, writing, music. And also friends, family, cats. Somedays what has helped most is a friend calling me up and asking if I want to go for coffee and have a chat. Somedays it’s been a family member cooking for me when I couldn’t myself.,Mental illness is complex but supporting someone with it doesn’t have to be. Just make sure you look after yourself first, because you cannot pour from an empty glass.,What I can’t emphasise enough is that there is no standard of sickness for you to deserve help. You deserve help when you doubt you need it. Also, your worst days in recovery will still be better than your best days in your illness. Talking helps. People are far more understanding than you think they’ll be, because there really is no shame in whatever you’re going through. All you need to do is give yourself and those around you a chance."
"G, ","I love learning. Particularly about the mind and behaviour, in both humans and animals. This was my reason to go to university, to pursue the desire to learn, coming out with a better understanding of a topic I was passionate in. I knew it wouldn’t be easy, but I didn’t know it would be this hard.,Before I started university, I spent my gap year trapped in ,, ,, and social anxiety. This unfortunate combination made me only desire to go to learn, keep my head down, and hope that people wouldn’t dislike me. I didn’t consider making friends or growing personally, as I thought this wasn’t obtainable to me. I was wrong.,University has pushed me both positively and negatively. It made me do things that my mind told me I couldn’t do but would have to do for the pursuit of academic success. Sitting in large lecture rooms, having seminars, group projects – all things that seemed impossible I somehow accomplished. I’ve grown a lot in confidence and my social anxiety has lessened, mainly thankful to the wonderful people at university. Opening up to other people about struggling with my mental health and them doing the same has provided me with rich and wonderful relationships.,However, university has been extremely challenging and many times I did not think I’d make it. The stress that results from the pressures of; assignments, finances, the impossible work-life balance has greatly damaged my mental health. Feeling consumed and overwhelmed everyday was awful, while also feeling I was the only one feeling the pressure making things worse. I can’t count the amount of times I have cried endlessly from the pressure or told myself that I have to drop out of university or even life from due to feeling such distress.,Being a perfectionist has made all of the above much harder than it needs to be. Getting good grades, attending every lecture, looking “together” – all aren’t people’s stereotypical view of an individual with mental health problems. If I was struggling, then I should show it behaviourally, or have nothing to worry about as my grades were good. Yet none of this matters when you are feeling so distressed. The fact that I had to be a certain way to be deserving of help made it very hard for me to try and ask for help and has prevented me from asking many times.,What has bothered me the most about my experience of university while living with mental health problems is the ideas that are imposed in academic culture. I distinctly remember being told that “Everyone feels this stressed but you have to learn to manage it to be able to do other things in the future. Everyone feels this way”. Not feeling alone is helpful, yet without the resources, how is anyone meant to cope? Academia seems to suggest that we should be stressed, devoting all our time and energy to studying, working towards burn out. Through any means, focussing on university should be paramount to everything else, regardless of your circumstances.,That should not be the way. For students to do well and be able to manage long-term, mental health must be considered. Not all students have mental health problems, but all of them have mental health, which in such a culture is not prioritised. I have seen on a wide scale how my peers have struggled and been let down. Services at university are overwhelmed, with advocating looking after student mental health rarely being mentioned, when it should be a priority. Feeling like universities don’t care is one of the hardest things to come to terms with, especially as students are dedicating their time and money to these institutions for years.,Regardless, I am somehow nearly finished with my last year at university and I’m not sure how I got here. Things are still extremely hard, I can recall a panic attack that nearly made me pass out when writing my dissertation last month, yet I’m still managing. I am extremely proud of myself for continuing, and only could do so through; therapy, supportive friends/family, and recently medication. I have learnt so much, both academically and personally, and I am glad that I stayed.,What has really pleased me is that my university is participating in University Mental Health Day, which shows me that they do care and are encouraging discussing mental health. To all students that are struggling: You are valid and deserve help regardless of the level of distress that you are in. Be real with yourself and other people, as being vulnerable is not a sign of weakness, but is a,
strength.,If someone you know at university is struggling with a mental health problem be there for them and encourage them to talk just by asking how they are. It doesn’t have to be a lot, but showing you’re in their corner really makes the difference."
"Charlie, ","I remember when someone first spoke to me about my mental health. I'd had a , in college, something that happened quite frequently despite me not realising what a panic attack was at the time, but this time a tutor noticed and advised me to visit a doctor. At this point I thought nothing of it since I'd put my anxiety symptoms down to a physical issue rather than a mental issue, despite struggling with it for two years already, and so I agreed to book a doctor's appointment the following day. It turned out this would be the first visit of many and that a lot of my mental health I had been in denial about was about to come to light.,This blog is the first time I've opened up about this on such a large scale and I was very hesitant about doing it, until I realised that being hesitant is the reason mental health has been such a stigmatised topic for so long. If talking about my story helps just one person to start a conversation then I guess it's worth it.,In February 2018, at the age of 18, I was admitted to a psychiatric unit for the first time. I was struggling with ,, , and an ,. Along with weight, I lost all hope of ever getting better. The next two months that followed in my first hospital admissions were the most difficult and scary months of my life and led to me being sectioned under the Mental Health Act for my own safety.,Over the past year I was admitted three times in total to two different psychiatric units, kept overnight for observation on two other occasions, received home treatment on three occasions, and attended A&E a further three times for assessment following crisis. All of this led to me making the decision to defer my entry to university to focus on getting better.,During this time, talking to the people close to me about my mental health has kept me going. My friends have been my rocks from visiting me in hospital to supporting me in my return to college. My tutors were amazing during this too: if they hadn’t taken me to hospital I may not have been able to sit my A levels and get the grades I did. I now have an even bigger support network helping me from people in work, the support workers at the hostel where I live, and the mental health professionals in charge of my care.,Through my experience I learned that discussions about mental health are so important, and my situation could have been so different if people hadn't stepped in to talk about my mental health. I'm still struggling a lot and have lots of appointments and a care and treatment plan in place to try and avoid hospital admissions, but I've got a large support network around me that are there to look out for me when I'm too ill to look out for myself.,There's so much stigma and misconceptions about mental illness when you compare it, for example, to physical illness. That needs to change. Talking can make such a difference, it's so important that people are able to open up about how they’re feeling."
"Rachel, ","I can’t quite believe how much my life has changed since my , in 2015. I left my science communication job to become a science technician (never leaving science education, obviously!), and my personal life has had some massive upheaval too.,One thing that hasn’t changed is the effect of my work on my mental health and, conversely, the effect of my mental health on my work. I didn’t tell my new manager about my depression until my circumstances changed so drastically that I knew it would affect my work. I’d already been in my current role for a year by then so I knew and trusted my department, but I still didn’t feel I could “go public” about my depression. ,A few months later, it got to a point where I’d started having panic attacks at work, and just my manager and HR director wasn’t enough. So, very nervously, I told the rest of my department one lunchtime. They were so supportive and wanted to do whatever they could to help me. They don’t treat me any differently, and they take a genuine interest in how I am. I finally felt like I’d found a workplace where I could feel valued and settled, and it meant so much to me.,That all fell apart when my manager told us he was leaving: it came as a total shock. ,It was terrifying telling my new manager, someone I’d known for one day, about my depression - I had no idea how he’d react.,I’d needn’t have worried because he handled it brilliantly. I told him I’d had depression for a long time, I was managing it with my GP and that it wasn’t really affecting work at that point.,However, within a week I’d been told to book an emergency appointment with my GP because I’d been experiencing suicidal thoughts, and that I should consider reducing my hours at work. It turned out to be the start of many weeks of informal catch-ups, meetings with HR and occupational health, counselling and breakdowns before being signed off work and coming back on a phased return. But my department, my manager and HR director have been fantastic, and with their support I’ve got a Wellness Action Plan in place.,Being back at work, and feeling so empowered to talk about my mental health with my colleagues, has had such a positive impact on my life. I’ve got amazing support at work. My colleagues are now used to me commandeering a glorified cupboard so that I can listen to music and do some colouring in when life feels a little overwhelming. ,It’s nice knowing that, slowly but surely, I’m getting well again. I had an amazing moment this week when I compared my occupational health report from just before I was signed off work three months ago with the one from last week - it’s unreal to think how far I’ve come in that time, thanks to the support I’ve had from my friends, family and work, and my own hard work.,My friends and family have been amazing during this turbulent time as well. They’ve encouraged me to speak to my GP and to my manager, spoken to me on the phone at stupid o’clock and dealt with me turning up unannounced on their doorsteps. They’ve reminded me of who I am when depression isn’t clouding my judgement, and that they’ve always loved me and always will. ,My life has changed so much - I’ve lost people who were my rock, but I’ve made some fantastic new friends along the way. ,I’ve learned a lot about myself, and what I need to stay well. ,Self-care isn’t all cake and bubble baths - it’s about survival. Some days it’s remembering to brush your teeth, to eat and drink.,I’ve discovered new hobbies like singing in a choir and going to the gym. I thought they were extravagant, but I and others noticed how much my health deteriorated when I stopped doing them. I’ve also started meditating - originally I’d pooh-poohed the idea, but taking time each day to just “be” is so grounding.,In my previous blog, I said how one day I’d be more open about my mental health. I’m so glad I’ve reached that point, even if it took me a few years to get there. I’ve taken ownership of my depression, and I’m proud of how much I’ve achieved. The fact that my openness has encouraged others to seek help for their mental health issues, or even just think about mental health, is incredible. I always said I’d have my “small but perfectly formed” support network to thank, and I do - it’s just now it’s a different group of people, and it’s a lot bigger."
"Robyn, ","As I psych myself up to write this, I contemplate how many things I have had to psych myself up for already today...getting out of bed, getting washed, brushing my hair, eating, driving to work, focusing on conversations, meeting deadlines, remembering what I have to do and in what order, and this is all before midday. This has been a part of my 'routine' for the last 15 years and it is exhausting.,I have always been an anxious person but this developed into an eating disorder when I was 15 and I was diagnosed with depression at around 21, when I knew I needed to talk to somebody about the severity of my mental health issues. Nothing in particular triggered my anxiety and depression; a fact that made it harder for those around me to understand. I hid it for years and thought I was coping through self-harm. I was wrong.,When I finally told my parents, after 7 years of gradually growing apart because of this unspoken truth that lay between us, I thought all my problems would be solved. It turns out, talking is only the beginning. What I didn't realise was how hard it is for loved ones to come to terms with such devastating news, and I realised that they had no idea how to treat me once they knew that I had been struggling in silence. They blamed themselves, they referred to it as a phase, they suggested remedies, they trod on eggshells. Just when I thought I could breathe again, the air was sucked out of me by all of these overwhelming reactions, making me feel I had to hide again. They needed support as much as I did, which is partly why I am writing this blog. It took another 5 years to tell them that the problem hadn't gone away with time; it wasn't a phase, and that I am now medicated to help me cope.,The thing is, those with mental illness don't need a quick fix. We don't need lots of presents. We don't need to feel guilty that we didn't speak out sooner. We don't need to be reminded of how lucky we are and how it could be worse. We need you to listen, to check in, to educate yourself, to accept this part of us. To understand that what we are going through is real and the longer it is hidden away, the longer it takes for us to bring it into the open and get support.,It's been two years since I have self-harmed, but not a day since I haven't fought with my own thoughts and felt exhausted after playing the part each and every day. I have since told some of my colleagues and those who have understood have made me want to be here longer. My best friends who call just to see how I am doing that day, have made the worst days bearable by making me feel safe to talk. My mental health disorders haven't vanished and still cause me no end of pain, but I can finally see a light at the end of a very dark tunnel.,The times I have felt most supported have been over a cup of tea, talking freely about my conditions, without fear of judgment. There is such a long way to go, and not everyone in my life is as supportive as others. I still have days when I am looked at in pity or told to 'Smile, it’s not the end of the world'. If nothing else comes from this, I hope one person chooses to ask and listen to those of us who are begging internally for support but are terrified to say it out loud. Those who did saved my life. Be those people."
"Abbie, ","It all started as just a few thoughts. ,But over time, I started having extremely bad anxiety and was becoming more depressed. School was using the little effort I had left. I gave up all my after-school clubs, all sporting events. I wouldn't eat at school or at home.,After a few months, I reached out to my friends about what was happening. But sadly, at that time they just came out with remarks about how I was being ungrateful and it was all for attention.,I felt extremely judged. Their comments made me feel worse.,I started self-harming and had suicidal thoughts. I was angry at myself, at everyone. I felt isolated even though I was sat with a big group of friends each day.,By the beginning of next summer I had hit rock bottom. I kept thinking that suicide would be a way out whenever something bad happened.,In the end a friend noticed something was up and reached out to me. She supported me all summer and helped me work my way through my thoughts. She spent time just talking and it made me feel better. A few days during the summer she came to my house and we just watched funny movies, cooked lunch together and just had a laugh. But it was as little as asking how I was feeling that made me feel like someone cared about me.,I told my parents and they helped me, and I got the help I needed from professionals.,Now I'm doing well in school. I can say I'm happy, and while I still have my bad days, I have the support I need from my friends and family. I feel like my past is behind me and now I just live life as good as I can.,If you’re struggling with your mental health, don't be afraid to talk to your friends, teachers, parents, guardians, whoever you trust about anything that is happening to you. Chances are, someone will support and help you through it.,And if you see someone who looks like they are having a bad day or they look a bit stressed, just ask them if they are okay, it could make a big difference to them. Don’t be afraid."
"Jemma, ","Today, any of my friends would tell you that I am more than happy to talk about mental health openly and without shame. In fact, it's one of my favourite topics of conversation, and I think sometimes people might wish I would give it a rest. But I refuse to stop talking about it, because I know exactly how much impact a single conversation can have, and what it feels like to struggle alone in silence.,At the age of 15, I was studying for my GCSEs, like every other teenager in the country. I achieved well at school, lived in a wonderfully loving home with my parents and younger sister, and was surrounded by great friends. And then I became unwell. ,, ,, and everything else that came with it. Suddenly, everything had changed, and each subsequent day felt increasingly torturous. Although, I believe people in my life suspected something was wrong, for a long time no one asked me what was going on in a way I felt able to answer.,Looking back, now aged 21, I can see that this was partly due to the fact I was terribly ashamed that I wasn't able to 'just get on with things' in the way I thought many of my peers did. I decided it was easier to say I was fine, than attempt to explain what I was feeling. After all, I had no idea what was really wrong, so how could I possibly explain it to someone else who doesn't really seem to have the time of day? One teacher demanded to know why my grades had dropped, and when I couldn't find the words, they told me I wasn't working hard enough; another told me they were sick of my excuses: they said it was ""disappointing"". And I wondered, if the adults in my life thought this, then what would my friends think? I heard words like 'mental', 'crazy', and 'psycho' being used in the most derogatory way in every day classroom chatter. So, I was silent, and this carried on for months.,This was until a particularly wonderful teacher changed everything with a single conversation. She invited me into her office and asked me if there was anything I wanted to talk about, because I hadn't seemed quite myself. She told me there was no pressure to tell her anything, but I could talk if I wanted to and she was there to listen for as long as I needed. For the first time, I was able to tell another person about some of the thoughts, feelings and behaviours that I had been living with for months. It is hard to explain the feeling of having this weight lifted from your shoulders, but if you can imagine the relief you might feel when you catch a glimpse of a lighthouse after spending months lost in a storm at sea? Well, I don't imagine it's dissimilar to that.,This conversation was the first step on the long journey of recovery, a journey I am still on now, and probably will be to some extent for the rest of my life. It was the first step towards having an honest conversation with my parents, going to see my GP, and getting referred to CAMHS where I was able to access a psychiatrist to get an accurate diagnosis and specialist treatment. This conversation was my beacon of light in the darkest of storms, and the person who started it saved my life.,There is a misconception that people shouldn't, or even can't, have conversations about mental health because they're not 'professionals', 'counsellors' or 'therapists', but this couldn't be further from the truth.,No qualifications are needed to offer a vulnerable person a safe space and time to talk. Often the most meaningful conversations are those in everyday life, where simply a listening ear is offered: over a cup of coffee with a friend, cooking dinner with a family member, or on a lunch break at work with a colleague. When you start having these conversations, you realise that usually no advice is needed or wanted, but rather the opportunity to chat without the fear of judgement.,If you're not sure how to start a conversation, I would volunteer the words offered to me by my amazing teacher: ""Is there anything you want to talk about? You haven't seemed quite yourself lately."",On Time to Talk Day 2019 (and every day after, of course!) I urge you to remember that one conversation can change a person's life, whether you realise it or not."
"Alice, ","So you’ve decided to have a conversation about mental health? That’s amazing! Whether you’re the person being brave enough to talk, or the one taking the time to listen, you’re doing a great thing.,
I’ve attempted to talk about my struggles with ,, , and panic attacks more times than I can count, to varying degrees of success. I know there can be so much pressure and expectation surrounding this conversation and I’ve come to realise - through lots of trial and error - that four key things can help make this conversation as good as possible.,
The first? COMFORT.,I’ve talked about my mental health in many uncomfortable settings: in the deputy head’s office at school; around the dinner table with my parents; in a cramped, grey meeting room on campus. It doesn’t have to be this way! It’s crucial that everyone in the conversation feels physically and emotionally comfortable throughout, but keep in mind that different things work for different people. I like being in my own house so I’m in control and it’s a familiar, quiet environment. Others may like being in a more public yet still relaxed setting, like a coffee shop. Some may find comfort in holding the other person’s hand throughout the conversation, or being given the occasional hug, but others won’t want to be touched at all - perhaps start by laying out boundaries.,I’d argue there’s one universal rule: if you’re the one listening to someone else’s experiences, please put your phone on silent and ideally keep it out of sight. I find that if someone’s phone keeps going off or they’re often looking towards it, my walls go up because I panic that they don’t really want to be talking to me, or would rather be elsewhere.,
 ,The next key thing is TIME.,This is vital. If someone is willing to talk to you about their mental health, you should be honoured that they feel comfortable enough with you to share what’s on their mind. But please don’t expect them to sum up their experiences in a five minute, well-rehearsed, easy-to-digest speech. There will be pauses, stuttering, muttering, tangents, tears - or even a good few minutes of silence whilst they work out how and where to begin.,
So, it’s really important this conversation takes place when all participants have a decent chunk of time to spare. It’s also a good idea to manage expectations from the start - by warning the person that you have, say, until 3pm to sit with them. This helps to avoid the risk of the person sharing their story feeling like a burden or a nuisance for taking up your time.,
Next, let’s talk about REFRESHMENTS.,What may sound trivial can actually be one of the most important ingredients in a good conversation. I’m always more open and expansive (and honest) with a mug of tea or coffee in front of me. I suppose this is partly because of the warmth a hot drink gives, making me feel instantly more comfortable (and as I’ve already outlined, comfort is key). But I also think just having something to do with your hands, and a secondary focus, can assist in easing nerves. Plus, taking a sip from your mug gives you a chance to pause, breathe, and really consider what you’d like to say.,
Of course, if you’re not a hot drink fan and you can’t be tempted by a biscuit, you could have something else nearby to fiddle with if necessary – a pen, a piece of jewellery or a soft toy are all good options.,
Finally, consider your NEXT STEPS.,If you’ve listened to a friend or loved one talk about their mental health, you might be upset, or unsure what to feel - that’s understandable! Please remember that, although you’ve been someone’s confidant, you’re entitled to seek help yourself. Check in with how you’re feeling, and use the Time to Change website to find out how to seek support.,
If you’ve just shared your experiences, it’s ok if you’re unsure what you want to happen next! Ask your loved one whether they’re happy to continue to be a listening ear, accompany you to future appointments etc.,Neither of you should make firm promises or resolutions - this could cause upset in future if they can’t be met. In one of my lowest moments, a friend suggested that from then on, we should think of ourselves as a team, facing everything together. I think this is a brilliant next step to take: agreeing that, whilst neither of you has immediate answers or solutions, you’re a team, picking up the slack for one another where necessary - because a problem shared really is a problem halved."
"Christopher, ","Just before Christmas this year I began to have thoughts that weren't entirely to my liking. I put it down to the usual feelings I get around that time. They'll pass.,
Christmas came around, the thoughts were getting worse. The nagging thought that something isn't right. I was deeply unhappy. It was only Christmas Day afternoon that I found myself at peace. As a family we were all enjoying time together.,
The 27th of December I was back at work, this will help, I thought, the job keeps me busy and focused. Then the thumping heart beat would start. ,? Why? Stupidly I ignored it. I began to feel sorry for myself, and it began to manifest in to something much darker.,
New year, new start. Yup pretty much, but not a new start I'd wish on anyone. Looking back now it all seems so clear. I was irritable, looking to pick fights, writing incendiary tweets to get the reaction I wanted. Bad vibes.,The days passed and I became focused on finding a way out of my darkness. This is the bit I find hardest to write, but I feel it needs to be put out there, for people to understand it can happen, and something can be done to stop it.,
I began to Google ways to end my life. I began planning when would be the best time to do it. I knew it would destroy people's lives so what date would be the best to lessen the impact years down the line. My heart is thumping as I write this now. It's a matter of when, not if. I needed out, I couldn't see my life improving, or even staying the same. It was getting worse.,
Thankfully I slipped up, something totally unrelated to my own battles opened the flood gates. My reckless nature almost destroyed the woman I love. It all came rushing out. How I'd felt for weeks, how quickly those feelings developed, my worries and stresses, my plan to end it all. My wife was destroyed, she'd heard it before, other than attempting to take my own life. I couldn't do this to her over and over again, my brain was screaming ""get out, get out now, there's no way back"". Mrs G had other ideas, basically calling me an idiot. Putting others before my own mental health. Home truths. They hurt but everything was brought in to a very sharp focus. This woman would do anything for me. I needed to realise that. We talked, hugged, listened and laughed.,
By talking I could suddenly see a future. I wasn't on my own. Rather than tumbling over a cliff, I was now hanging on, and in weeks to come, I can camber to safety. It's not a fairy tale. It isn't just a case of me talking and everything being fine. I'm still very capable of misinterpreting something and thinking the worst. It's learning that it's not the case.,
The support from people on Twitter, people I barely know, friends and colleagues has been overwhelming. It will be incredibly embarrassing meeting these people next time, but at least there will be a next time.,Struggling with mental illness can be very isolating, and the fear that brings with it will often lead to someone becoming closed off. Starting a conversation about mental illness will help 'normalise' those feelings. You begin to feel like someone is listening, that somebody cares.,Talking is the most powerful treatment for mental illness, if gives you an outlet, it helps people understand and it lessens any stigma. Yes I struggle with pretty severe , at times, but I also enjoy many of the things you do, don't alienate me, include me.,
Time to Talk Day is February 7th, I implore you to take the time to start a conversation about mental health.,
Peace and thank you.,

"Bernice, ","Sometimes, a little push is needed to get the ball rolling. ,Despite the fear of being perceived as nosy or intrusive it’s important to remember that when it comes to mental health, checking in with someone reminds them they aren’t alone when they’ve gone quiet. ,In the summer of 2018 I found myself struggling with , more than ever before. Work became increasingly difficult to show up to, I feared confiding in anyone about my mental health because I saw myself as a burden.,I felt like I’d be draining to listen to, not worthy of being cared about. With my self-esteem at rock bottom, I couldn’t even begin to appreciate the empathy of others. ,Depression had completely changed my life.  ,All my friends were enjoying the long bright days, maximising the warm weekends, going on adventures, getting engaged, and house hunting whilst I became increasingly isolated, on the outside looking in.,Days passed wishing someone could see me and my pain.,I wanted to talk about how much I was struggling but didn’t know how. ,I feared scaring others, it became excruciatingly routine to just ignore the phone.  ,Depression became my world, I couldn’t imagine anyone else wanting to see inside so I pushed everyone away. I didn’t want to drag them into my own turmoil. ,I’d experienced periods of low mood but depression in its entirety overwhelmed me, I felt trapped in my loneliness, convinced that no one wanted to hear the truth about how I was really feeling when they asked. ,It was easier to shut people out in and outside of the home with the classic “I’m fine” when in truth I was falling apart, bereft with the fatigue of life becoming progressively joyless.,Inside I knew that if a friend was having a tough time, I’d want to know how they were really doing just so they knew they had a friend on the other side of the walls around them. I’d never been in the habit of giving up on people but struggled not to give up on myself. ,I’d spent my life giving my time, energy, love, and patience to others yet couldn’t imagine getting back in return. ,I didn’t know how to accept help because I couldn’t believe I was worthy of it. ,Weeks of avoiding social contact had passed, and a colleague turned close friend reached out again. She wanted to see me, catch up and see how I was, we’d formed a really close bond at work, and though my walls were still up I let her in. ,She thankfully wasn’t buying it when I said I was “fine”. ,The fact that she was persistent with communication despite me being consistently unresponsive pushed me to realise hearing from her really added to my willingness to at least try and open up. ,It reminded me that I had a real friend out there, that I was cared about. ,Despite the walls depression encouraged me to put up, I’d learned it’s okay to take a few bricks down and talk to the person on the other side. ,We’d been sat over dinner talking about work, summer plans, and books we’d shared an interest in. I mentioned not having read much recently because I couldn’t bring myself to do it. Then came the dreaded question.,“So, how are you?”,I sat there speechless, eventually telling her I couldn’t answer that. ,It felt like a loaded question. ,As a society we’ve become accustomed to seeing conversations about negative thoughts and feelings as something to be ashamed of yet talking about having the flu is seen as normal.  ,“Seriously, just say whatever comes to mind. I want to know how you’re feeling.”,That push right there, her asking me for a second time led to me opening up about feeling low, desperately unhappy, and not enjoying life. ,It steered to me explain why I struggled to keep up with reading, about leaving my job I’d been away from on sick leave for a while, and what I’d like to move on to. I didn’t feel like I had to filter what I was saying so it all just came out; the dam of pent up emotion had burst its banks.,She never judged me, only listened. ,We didn’t spend the whole evening talking about my mental health, we just talked. ,The #AskTwice campaign is the push I wish I’d had years ago when I started to struggle with my mental health. It opened my eyes to really think about all the times I’ve said I was fine when I wasn’t, and when others around me have done the same. ,There are misconceptions about how to talk to someone with a mental health problem, but the truth is you don’t need to be a mental health expert, or try to “fix” someone, the only thing needed is your willingness to listen, empathy, and an open mind. ,A friend with a mental health problem is still a friend, a life with mental health problems is still a life. #AskTwice to remind someone that they aren’t invisible, and that they will be heard. "
"Rianna, ","You have bad days. Your car doesn’t start, you’re late to work, you miss a meeting – it’s a bad day. You just want to get home, put your feet up and write it off because tomorrow is a fresh start – an opportunity to reset your mind and put yesterday down to , ,Tomorrow you get to work on time, you go into a meeting and give an outstanding performance, your boss pulls you to one side and talks about a possible promotion. You text your partner who wants to take you for a celebratory dinner. You show up to the restaurant and he’s there with flowers and a ring – he proposes to you. Your day could not have gone better. But you go home, and you cry yourself to sleep. You wake up feeling empty. You feel heartbreakingly sad and you have no idea why. You convince yourself he doesn’t know you, because if he did, he would never want to marry you. If people at work knew what you were really like, they wouldn’t promote you. They would fire you. ,They would fire you, because you are worthless. He would leave you because you are fundamentally unlovable. But to the outside eye, your life could not be more perfect, and there is no logical reason why you shouldn’t be ecstatic. At your engagement party you fake a smile and tell everyone how incandescently happy you are, but it is all a lie. You smile because you should. You tell people you are happy because that is how you should feel. But you don’t. There is a gaping sadness in you, which is there for no reason at all. ,And no one can see it, so maybe it’s just you. Maybe something’s wrong with you. What possible reason do you have to be sad? And you feel ashamed. So you don’t say anything to anyone. Because when you have in the past, they’ve said –, , , , So you stay silent. You internalise the struggle. You fight it alone.  ,How do you explain something you don’t understand? How do you tell people how you feel when you don’t feel anything? And when you do feel, it is an onslaught of self-loathing and unparalleled sadness. ,You go into work the next day, and you don’t have the energy to lie. You don’t have the energy to pretend to be okay. So you excuse yourself and you go to the bathroom. You make sure no one else is in there, you lock yourself in a stall and collapse onto the floor, crying uncontrollably. You struggle to catch your breath and you panic because you cannot get enough oxygen to your lungs. You cry more. You panic more. You start to remember every bad thing that’s happened in your life, every negative comment, every failed relationship, every single thing that happened which is all your fault. You cry until your facial muscles cramp, until you can catch your breath long enough to remember where you are. ,And you sometimes even calm yourself down by telling yourself it won’t last forever, that you can make it all end. You pick yourself up off the floor, readjust your clothes, wipe your tears and open the door. And someone is standing there. Someone is standing there looking at you. But they are looking at you with compassion and understanding. They are looking at you because even though they don’t understand what you feel, they understand that you are in a lot of pain, and you cannot see a way out. That you are struggling. So they step forward, place their hands in yours, and ask for your story. ,I look up at them, fresh tears in my eyes. I prepare to confess. I prepare to hear the same responses that I have heard since I was 15 years old. But I take a deep breath and tell her. I tell her and I close my eyes. Waiting for the disappointment. But she says nothing. I look at her and she’s crying. And she tells me that she believes me. The weight lifts off my chest. The guilt and the shame I had been carrying around for 10 years had almost gone. Because I knew there was something wrong with me, and she believed me.,We go for a drink, and she asks me when this all began. We sit for hours. She asks me how I feel. She cares. She gives me her number and tells me to contact her when I need to talk to someone. It is a lifeline. It is renewed hope that with the help of someone else, I can be better than this. I can live a better life than this. I can overcome this. And it all started when she placed her hands in mine. "
"Jamil, ","People won't always know if you're struggling. Sometimes it feels like being silent is the only viable option. After all, why would you want to burden someone else with your problems?,When I was at sixth form college, I found it hard to balance college assignments with my part-time work. Evening and weekend shifts were taking up a lot of free time. I was burning myself out. The anxiety around achieving the right grades for uni was making me stressed. My workplace was not supportive when it came to my mental health challenges. Feeling depressed wasn't a choice. It was a natural reaction to my personal circumstances.,My GP recommended activities to help me feel better. Some of these involved going outside. Work penalised this by issuing written and verbal warnings. The reason being that I wasn't housebound during my sick leave. The worst moment was when I tried to confide in my line manager that I was experiencing severe ,.,My sick note had ""stress"" as the reason because that is what I asked my GP to write. I asked them to write this because I found it embarrassing to be honest about the true nature of my illness. My line manager scoffed when they saw ""stress"" on my sick note. How could someone of my age feel stressed?,When I said it was depression, they started laughing at me. This made me feel like a joke. My depression felt invalid.,I ended up dropping out of college during the second year. At this moment in time, it wasn't right for me.,It wasn't until a few years after when I moved on from my part-time job and started an apprenticeship in the public sector. This was a different experience. I found it easier discussing my personal circumstances with my new line manager. My circumstances included ongoing domestic abuse, and long-term consequences from historic abuse. This was affecting my performance at work, and even my ability to arrive on-time. I ended up sharing a lot with my line manager over the course of my apprenticeship.,They never laughed at my circumstances, nor any of my speculative diagnoses. My depression was not invalidated.,I learned something valuable from these two very different experiences. Both involved me opening up about my struggle with mental illness. Both involved line managers, who provided contrasting reactions. What I learned was that the reaction you receive says more about that person than it does you.,In 2017, I attended a mental health hospital as a voluntary in-patient. I am not afraid of telling you that the reason for my admission was acute psychosis. My anxiety was getting out of control and I was experiencing delusions. I believed that I was not safe outside. I believed that everyone was watching me. This time, I was honest from the beginning about why I needed time off work.,My line manager was understanding. They had the emotional intelligence not to penalise me for a lapse in my mental wellbeing. I was in hospital for over one month before being discharged back to my GP. I met with my line manager outside of work for lunch. We talked about the best way to help me return to work and college without burning myself out.,We agreed on a phased return to work plan. I received flexible time off to attend mental health-related appointments. I could not have asked for a more understanding and empathetic line manager during this time.,The same can be said of my college tutors. They were aware of the recent events, and had regular check-ins with me. I didn't always feel like I deserved their time and attention. I even said this to them at times. They always assured me that their job is to help me achieve the best of my ability. I am grateful for the time and efforts from my line manager and college tutors. It is thanks to them that I not only completed my apprenticeship, but also developed the skills to progress to a new position. I'm still in the public sector so that pension pot is still growing ;),You can't assume everyone will react the way you want when you open up about your mental health challenges. But you won't get any reaction unless you speak up.,Hold on. What if I’m on the receiving end? What’s the correct thing to say? What kind of reaction is right?,It might be easier to first tell you what kind of reaction I believe is wrong. It's one that dismisses what you've been told as nonsense or something silly. For example, I recently revealed some details about my anxiety to a work colleague. I told them that I am always on edge. No matter where I go, I can't seem to relax.,They told me to ""just chill out"".,This was a bad response and demonstrates weak emotional intelligence. In this scenario, it would have been acceptable, and intelligent, to ask questions like:,""Has there ever been a time when you didn't feel like this?"",""How do you manage those feelings?"",Or, and this one works in many situations,,""Is there anything I can do to help you?"",A simple offer of help can go a long way. It could even prevent someone from taking their own life. It's why I'm still here."
"Paula, ","As someone who has been combatting mental illness for many years, I felt it was important to share this. I have suffered two major , in my life and also struggled with three different ,. I know what it means when your mind takes control of every thought and distorts every single one into something upsetting, disturbing and self-destructive. I can honestly feel my head warp internal mind processes into an infernal torture where it seems impossible to go forward in life. ,I have professional help and it is the one thing that is helping me face my darkest side. I know I'm not ok sometimes and I can't seem to help those around me understand. They say, , but they have no idea what goes on inside my mind every day. ,There are days I can't get out of bed, where I could sleep for hours on end, where I feel like doing nothing, since nothing at all makes it better or go away. It's always there, my mind, full,
of auto-criticism letting me know I'll never be good enough in my business, in my relationships, in my personal achievements. It lets me know I'm worthless, useless, forever below the expectations of society, friends, family and most of all below the expectations I have of myself. ,It honestly does not matter what is going on around me. I have people ask me where I am, where I was, because I certainly wasn't present with them at that moment. I have exercised to the point of almost losing consciousness, I've binged on food to fill the emptiness, I have tried to starve myself to make it all stop, I have wanted to leave this world and free myself from the constant torture of my thoughts. ,If I ever try to share any of this I get very little understanding, as if I have invented these problems, that it is me that can control these thoughts, that I do it on purpose, that I'm trying to get attention, that I have ,. As though this isn't an acceptable part of me to show because I am meant to be a strong, beautiful and successful business woman who has to be first and foremost a partner, a lover, a friend, a daughter, a boss. This is who they want to see and who they want me to be always. ,And that is simply exhausting. Can we not accept that we are flawed, have more compassion, let people who are suffering from mental illness know that even if we don't understand, that we are there by their side, even in their worst moments. Just by being there and accepting our weaknesses, that we don't want to change the ""mind"" of mental illness by ""snapping"" out of it or by ""being happy"". Accept that negative emotions and thoughts are part of us, that it's ok for them to be there and to love us even if we are mentally ill, just as you would love and care for someone with a broken arm. ,Help someone with mental illness as you would someone with any illness, with compassion, love, care and closeness and help them get professional help, encourage them to share their problems even if it is hard to hear the darkest parts of us.,No one would hesitate to see a doctor about a physical illness or injury, so why is there still so much shame around getting psychological help for mental illness?,I have people ask me why I talk to a psychologist as if they know what is best for me and that I shouldn't need help for my mind, only weak or crazy people need that. We all need to wake up and make an effort to be more understanding, accepting and compassionate to those that suffer from mental illness. Only in this way can we help reduce suicide and offer other ways out., "
"Jonathan, ","Next time you hear someone say how far we’ve come in the fight against mental health, take a moment to consider that statement. 1 in 4 people suffer from mental illness in the UK – around 15 million people. That’s potentially 1 in 4 people you know - one of your close friends, a family member, or a colleague sitting at the desk next to you.,
But most of those people suffer largely in silence. Recent global studies estimate up to a third of people with depression receive no support or treatment at all. Why? Because despite what you may read in the media, there is still a massive stigma attached to mental illness. A stigma that prevents many from telling even their nearest and dearest, crippled by an overwhelming cocktail of shame, failure, inadequacy and hopelessness. ,
Most sufferers of , will have an experience involving a bad reaction, of some well-meant advice that had the inverse effect. Filed under “What not to say to someone with depression”. , Reactions that show while we may be talking more about mental illness, increased exposure doesn’t necessarily equate to a greater understanding of the condition.  ,
The fear of stigma is even more heightened in the workplace. If colleagues knew your secret surely they’d think differently about you, possibly questioning your reliability or your judgement. At best, they may just feel uncomfortable around you, not knowing what to say or how to say it.  At worst, they’ll doubt your ability to do the job. ,
All this means, for sufferers, divulging mental illness at work is a complex issue – a legal and moral dilemma I faced myself earlier this year, when I started a new job. The industry or sector is not important, because what happened next could have happened in many institutions or workplaces across the country. ,
On being told I’d got the job, I was invited in for an unofficial meeting to get to know my new colleagues and discuss schedules for upcoming projects. The department consisted of 12-15 people, all of whom seemed amicable, relaxed and funny. I could happily see myself working with these people and felt confident about my new role. That positive first impression lasted of all of five minutes.,
As the meeting progressed, the head of the department announced that a date had been set for a mandatory training session about mental health in the work place.  ,
With mock seriousness, the head of department noted that this was an important session, in light of what happened earlier in the year to Steve. For my benefit, she explained that Steve was a previous member of staff who had suffered “a mental breakdown” at work.  ,
I’d like to say it was one or two, and that it was frowned upon by the others, or swiftly shut down by the team leader, but that’s not what happened. Everyone involved in that meeting was in on the joke, some accessories only through a silent smirk, others outwardly laughing at Steve’s expense.  ,
The general tone was implicit. Steve couldn’t cut it. Steve wasn’t tough enough. No-one said it. No-one had to.  ,
One or two even voiced annoyance at having to give up their time to attend this awareness session, like the people who complain about rail delays when some desperate soul has jumped in front of a speeding train.  ,
And me? Well I was focusing hard to disguise the fact that my cheeks were blanching, and my throat tightening – the tell-tale signs of anxiety that would give my secret away. ,
Because I’m like Steve. Sometimes I struggle to keep things together. And as a long-term sufferer of depression, I was experiencing that all too common sinking feeling, triggered by the realisation that this was not going to be a healthy environment for me to work in.,
Attitudes like this are exactly why people are scared to confide in colleagues about their condition, myself included. In my working life, I’ve told perhaps 2 or 3 people about this illness since I was first diagnosed 9 years ago. I don’t want to be judged, treated differently, ridiculed or to make others feel uncomfortable in my presence.  ,
Instead, I choose to hide it. And I’ve been hiding it for so long, I’ve become an expert at concealing it from others. Although officially diagnosed at 34, with hindsight I now understand that I developed the condition in childhood, experiencing my first suicidal thoughts as early as 12 years of age. That’s over 30 years of hiding, pretending and lying. It’s become a part of who I am.,For the following month between that meeting and my first day in the new role, I could feel the dark clouds gathering. While I tried to fool myself and everyone else around me, I knew that I couldn’t work in an environment where people had such an obvious lack of respect and compassion for others suffering with mental health problems. They were laughing at Steve, but in a few months’ time they could be laughing about me.,
As friends and family wished me luck, I did what I do best – I put my gut instinct to one side and pretended everything was going to be ok. I went in for my first day, going through the motions in a robotic trance. ,
One of my first tasks was to complete mandatory HR forms. A formality for most.  Name, address, National Insurance number. Then the medical declaration form. A small tick box.  Asking me to declare any prior mental health conditions. Flashback to that room full of colleagues laughing. Would you tick it?,
I somehow got through the day, suppressing my emotions for later. When the inevitable breakdown happened on the drive home, it marked the release of a month of ,, worry and despair. I parked my car in a country lane, unable to face home, contemplating suicide. A frantic mess.,
But I’m lucky. When things get tough, I have the support of those who love me. Soon my phone was vibrating with texts and calls. My wife first. ,  A close friend. , My father. ,
And once the storm subsided, I did the only thing I could do for the sake of my health and well-being. I pressed send on my resignation email after just one day in the job. I didn’t mention the team meeting to HR. I wasn’t looking to lodge complaints and get others in trouble. This was about self-preservation.,
 ,
No-one is harder on a manic depressive than they are on themselves. Quitting as I did was another self-perceived failure that had to be explained away. There followed a string of excuses to friends, lies dressed up to help me salvage some dignity. , Anything other than the truth. ,
The whole episode triggered a complete relapse of my depression, which my GP informed me should now be considered a lifelong condition, requiring long-term medication. I was then signed off work for 4 weeks, from a job that no longer existed. “Do you need a letter?” – “No, I think I’ll be ok.” ,
So, the next time you hear someone say how far we’ve come, and how much perceptions of mental health have changed, ask yourself this. Would you feel comfortable telling your boss or work colleagues that you suffer from depression? Hearing those colleagues talking about Steve, I know I will certainly always think twice before opening up in future.,
And if by chance, you’re sitting next to a colleague who has divulged a mental health condition, instead of looking at him or her as the weak link in the team, consider what strength and bravery it took for them to share that information."
"Rosie, ","A simple gesture, a simple ‘Hey, how are you?’ can make all the difference in someone’s day. Talking about how the world around you is closing in on you, how you feel alone, how it’s raining gasoline and you’re trying your hardest to resist the urge to set yourself on fire can be very very challenging to talk about especially if you’ve never had that space to talk about it before.,
Having experienced anxiety and depression for a few years now myself, I know how self-debilitating it can get and feeling like you don’t have anyone to talk to. You’re afraid that if you let your guard down people will think that you’re weak, you don’t want to be vulnerable only to be left as a prisoner of your own mind, trapped with your demons, questioning your worth after giving away your secrets to people who you thought would be there forever.,
It’s not always easy to ask someone about their mental health and don’t ask if you’re not prepared to listen and will brush it off. It’s so important that if you do ask you actually care and try to understand what the person is trying to say. It won’t necessarily always make sense to you but for the person going through a hard time, I can assure you that they’re grateful that somebody is expressing a concern in them, have the time of day for them and are willing to listen to them. A listening ear, love and reassurance can save someone, trust me.,
You don’t even have to jump straight into mental health all the time. Regularly checking up on someone, whether they’re eating/sleeping well, making time for them, encouraging them to do activities such as sports with you can help. Sports can be a good way of releasing emotion and stress, and tends to make you feel better afterwards (unless you lose a game lol).,
It doesn’t always have to be talk, the little things you do for someone struggling which you don’t even realise make all the difference. Just knowing you have someone who you can speak to anytime and every time gives you that sense of support and makes you realise that you’re not alone and that there’s always hope. There are people out there who care and are willing to help you. However, I urge those who invest their time trying to support someone to only do and say what they can and will do. Don’t give someone your all only to wake up one day and abandon them. The fact that you have switched up after creating a safe space for them where they could be themselves freely without being judged now accumulates to fear that you will reveal their secrets to someone else and possibly even betray them - that can well and truly emotionally destroy someone more than you can imagine, so please only do what you can and are willing to do.,
Being able to speak to someone can take a big load off your shoulders, you naturally start to feel lighter as if the thing weighing you down has been lifted simply because someone listened to you, it’s so important you ask twice! If someone is acting slightly different, why not start a conversation and ask them how things are going? Always try to be understanding and approach the situation with concern and care.,
 ,Be the reason someone believes in the goodness of people."
"Sophie, ","I don’t think , can be summed up in one image. I think at times it’s a lot of images. I spent some time with my niece a few days after I had felt the lowest I have ever felt. My nieces and nephew mean the world to me. They remind me of the simple joys in life. I had just taken my niece to the park and she was so happy just sitting in a swing and it made me think “Why can’t everyone just feel that happy all the time?”. They make me want to fight for my life, so I can watch them grow up and be the best aunty I can be for them. ,I find it hard to explain to someone who hasn’t had mental health problems what depression feels like. It’s so many different feelings all at once, yet you feel nothing at the same time.,I have had , and , (Post traumatic stress disorder) in the past which I found I could hide from people more easily. Depression crept up slowly and completely wiped me out. It was my counsellor who first mentioned depression to me. Hearing it out loud hurt, but I needed the wakeup call. Looking back, I am glad it was her that noticed first. She has supported me ever since.,Admitting you have depression is such a massive step. It took me far too long to admit to family and friends that I was struggling. I felt ashamed and weak. I thought I could fight it alone, but the truth is you need their support more than ever when you aren’t coping. My family were starting to notice I was getting quieter and had lost my spark, yet I still pretended like everything was ok and tried my hardest to carry on as normal which eventually broke me. Don’t get me wrong, I have supportive family and friends, but I really struggle to talk to people about my feelings. It makes you feel so alone and such a burden on people even though they want to be there for you. It’s wanting to be around the people who love you, but also wanting to lock yourself in the house and cry alone. It’s having no energy to even get out of bed, but you have to get up and go to work, faking a smile to get through the day. ,I was blind to how depression can also affect the people that love and care about me. When you are in a dark place you might think people don’t care about you, but this isn’t necessarily the case. My family told me they feel helpless and don’t know what to do to make me feel better, but small things like just spending time with me, going for a walk and chat or just giving me a hug is enough to make me feel more human. You need to let people take care of you when you are down. It will make them feel better and having someone there to make you a cup of tea or something to eat can make you feel better too. When I did tell my family I was depressed, it was a small relief to no longer need to fake how I was feeling in front of them. I slowly started to see that I needed to accept help.    ,There is such a negative stigma surrounding mental health and that’s what I was most afraid of; people judging me and not understanding what I was feeling. Some people see mental health problems as attention seeking or a sign of weakness, which is why so many people choose to hide them. I feel frustrated that mental health is not talked about enough today. ,The way I see the journey of recovery is like a tree, leaves may fall and weather may rock a tree but the roots remain and new leaves will always bloom. My leaves and branches may have fallen, but I have amazing people in my life that will help me to grow and keep me rooted and I am thankful to them for being there for me when I needed them most. I have good days and bad days, but I now know I am stronger than my black dog and I will keep fighting for myself and for the amazing people around me!  "
"Emma, ","I am not good enough. I am not worthy of love. I am not smart enough. I am not successful enough. I am not slim enough. I am not pretty enough. ,
 ,
I am one of the 1 in 4 people who suffer from mental illness. ,Though mental illness is at the forefront of the media today, there are still many people living in ignorance, fuelling a stigma around mental illness that still hasn’t lifted. Everyone has a different life and therefore a different battle to fight every day. We have no idea what is happening behind closed doors or even worse, inside closed minds. Our minds can be a scary place at times. When they don’t allow us to function in our day to day routine we start to see the cracks in the perfect exterior.,Remarks like “Get over it"" or “Everything will be ok"" do not compute in the mind of those with mental health problems. They can come from those closest to us, like our parents, or the friends and colleagues who have never experienced mental illness. They try to be sympathetic but the words they choose to use can sometimes feel like a knife in the back. There are certain chemicals overloading our system that shouldn’t be, that can make us spiral into despair within our own minds, like a row of dominoes pushed to fall, it’s inevitable and more often than not, we have pushed them to fall ourselves.,There are definitive moments and decisions in my life that have led up to my diagnosis of , and ,. From peer pressure at the young age of 8, to my father leaving as a teenager then abuse in my first serious relationship at 18. For some time I have been able to overcome my illness but in that time what I didn’t realise was that I was suffering in silence. It may come as a surprise to some people but those like me with a mental illness can have the ability to be strong willed. However, this is the quality in a person that leads to silence, the “I can sort this myself"" or “No one needs to know"" voices in your head. This is also the quality that means there will never be any substance abuse, alcohol, drugs or even eating disorders, because these can be seen by others, your change in character noticed by those close to you.,More and more this illness has affected my life. Though unknown to others, it made me retreat into my own mind when I was younger, making me an introvert. I constantly tried to seek approval from those around me. Tried to make and keep friends by impressing them. Tried to show I was worthy of their friendship. It made me strive for perfection in everything I do but if I didn’t receive the acknowledgement I put myself down, to the point where I wondered if I should even be breathing. ,
 ,
Stigma can exist in all areas of life. Recently my employer was unfairly treating a colleague who was off sick and taking medication for a mental illness. When I challenged my employer’s behaviour and told her I was taking the same medication for depression and anxiety, she looked at me as though I was suddenly worthless. ""So that's what's wrong with you, that's why you're always spaced out."" I felt so many mixed emotions, the first of which was anger, which is why I responded with my resignation letter but then after a while, I started blaming myself. Thinking that there was something wrong with me and that she was right.,
When the one who claims to love you can make you feel so alone, in despair and unworthy of life; there’s a small part of you that disappears into darkness that you can never get back. It still affects me today more than I'd ever wish to admit. It took one special person to walk into my life and break down the walls I'd built so well. He held my hand whilst I crawled out of the shadows and I will love him forever for that. He still encourages me to this day to speak out about my experiences and my mental health and I know he'll be so proud of me, reading this. In a way I've helped him understand mental health more than he ever did before. He understands now that mental health is serious and our own dark thoughts sometimes can't be avoided. But he also understands that everyone's mental health makes them who they are, makes them unique.,
 ,
If I didn't speak out, if I didn’t reach out to those around me, I don’t think I’d be alive today. I am overly ambitious and want to be successful but sometimes pain can cloud the determination, can make the path towards a brighter future arduous and impossible. In my recent revelations I have learnt that sharing my story and talking about my mental health has helped others. I think it’s time to share my story with everyone so that something good can come out of something so dark.,To anyone reading this, remember it is ok to not be ok. It is ok to seek help. It is ok to speak out. Please do not suffer in silence. Silence is painful, soul destroying and will never help you. You are not letting your parents down if you tell them you’re struggling. You do not become anything less to your true friends when you tell them you’re not doing so well. You will always have someone thinking of you because those with mental illness are never alone. If there are 7 people in a room with you, chances are one of them is struggling too.,Break the silence. Break the stigma."
"Jordan, ","When I figured out something was wrong it was too late. It consumed me. I was so close to going through with it until someone rang and snapped me out of the way I was feeling. At the time I thought I had no one, no family or friends. I felt like I couldn’t speak to anyone about my mental health. ,
 ,
I had already lost a close friend to suicide. I’d heard about the high suicide rates amongst men which made me think “why is there no help for men to talk about their mental health” - because at the time I didn’t know how or where to get help from. ,
 ,
When friends used to ask how I was feeling, I just used to say “I’m alright thanks” and nothing more. The stigma around mental health made me think I would look weak or stupid for talking about my feelings. So I didn’t. ,
 ,
I felt trapped and alone, like no-one would understand what I was going through. One day the thoughts going though my head became too much. I lost a job because I broke down and couldn’t handle it anymore. I didn’t get out of bed for weeks because that was my safety area and nothing could go wrong if I stayed there. ,
 ,
When that was happening, my family started to notice and took me to the doctors and I got help. If it wasn’t for this I’m sure I wouldn’t be here anymore.  Sometimes you don’t know what’s going on behind closed doors but all I can say is be there for people and help them find someone before it’s too late. I have now lost another male friend to suicide but there were no signs or anything noticeable to give off something was wrong. ,
 ,
All I can say is be there for one another because just someone to talk to when you’re struggling can go a long way. Now I’m feeling a bit better about myself, don’t get me wrong I’m still a bit scared going out to places but I’m getting there with help. ,
 ,
I decided to share my story because there are still so many men and women out there who still need someone to help them and to talk to. My depression and anxiety was so bad at the time. I was snapping at everyone, I had no feelings towards anything, I didn’t want to do anything. It cripples you so much that I thought what’s the point in life. ,I have a wife and son and I used to think they were better off without me, that they could do so much better without me in their lives. I also thought that about everyone else in my life but now I know that isn’t true. I opened up to friends and family about my mental health and they are all supporting me. Now I’m trying my best for myself to get better. To be honest I didn’t think I would end up like this. It all hit me at once because I bottled everything up for a very long time. Until I couldn’t cope anymore, but with the help I’m getting I’m finding myself again and learning how to deal with things better. ,
 ,
Now, I always talk to someone if I need help instead of hiding it away and keeping it to myself. It can be hard to talk about mental health, but if we all get better at talking about how we’re really doing, we can help to break down the mental health stigma."
"Khali, ","Despite publishing a hundred books at the age of 19, I have been struggling with , and Asperger’s Syndrome for a very long time. It wasn’t until last year that I decided to speak up about my struggles with mental health. Prior to that, I talked about my issues with mental health in many of the books that I’ve written over the years, but I never addressed it publicly.,Thankfully, I found many resources that got me going. I got on Google and started doing the research on ways I could be able to share my story, and many things came up. I reached out to lots of people and did lots of writing, of course. Once my story started getting out there, I felt a weight being lifted from my subconscious. It felt so great to talk about my struggles so openly. I got so many positive comments. I got so much support from fans and loved ones, commending me for my courage to talk about something not too many people are willing to discuss so openly.,I feel like people who have, or have had, gripes with mental health problems are reluctant to tell others for many reasons. Everyone has their own different opinions on this topic. I wanted to tell you what held me back. Initially, I was afraid of being judged. Because of the things that I struggled with, I faced a lot of , from people that I knew. I was called very derogatory names pertaining to my mental health struggles. I never liked that. I was picked on in , because of it. Somehow, the struggles that I never asked for were always being used against me. It was to a point where I was embarrassed to even show my face in public because I was afraid of being judged.,Plus, society has placed this stigma on people who struggle with these conditions, labelling them “ill” or “retarded,” or something demeaning like that. Therefore, if you make someone who’s going through mental health problems to feel that way, it’ll only add to the struggles that they’re already dealing with. Would you tell someone who bashes you all the time your deepest, darkest struggles?,Another thing that held me back was the pain itself. Depression is not just some fad. It is a real thing that people go through. People have lost their lives to this affliction. It would be some days that my depression got so bad I didn’t want to do anything. I couldn’t pursue my hobbies. I didn’t even have enough motivation to get out of the bed in the morning. I had to force myself up. I felt like nobody could understand what I was going through, so I would just keep it all to myself. The more I did this though, the more the problems began to eat away at me. You could only take so much before you lose it. Everyone has their breaking point.,Also, in a sense, I did feel a bit too proud to ,. That sounds odd but let me explain. Since everyone else around me started to shrug off my struggles, by telling me that I have “no real problems” and I’m “too young to stress,” I started to do this too. On some days, it fazed me. Most days, I tried to act like it didn’t, but it was fazing me all along.,I wanted to put on this front, so people could quit teasing me by calling me “retarded” and “stupid”. Of course, this did more harm than good. However, I just got tired of pushing my problems to the side. I decided to embrace it by talking about it. I never would have thought that my struggles would be able to inspire someone else. I always saw my struggles with mental health as insignificant, not worthy of sharing with others. People around me made me feel that way about my mental health issues and who I was as a person. I’m now on the path to correct this level of thinking. I want to end this by saying…,If you, or anyone else that you know struggles with any kind of mental health problems, it’s okay to get help. Whenever people ask us how we’re doing, we’re quick to say “fine.” It doesn’t necessarily mean we’re fine at all. All it takes is that second question to open up the door toward the process of understanding.,For the month of October, please , if someone you know tells you that they’re “fine.”. It’s okay to talk about it. It’s okay to feel. The first step to healing is acknowledgement., "
"Lucy, ","‘Morning’,‘You alright?’,
‘Yeah, you?’,
‘Fine’,
I think we all have this conversation every day and we go away having no idea how the other person really is. It’s an English pleasantry, a well-rehearsed and ritualised exchange ingrained into our lives. Every time I have this conversation, I say I’m fine. The thing is, I’m not.,
It can be so hard to have that conversation, to say, actually, I’m not ok.,
The thing is, I assume that the person asking doesn’t really want to know. They aren’t really asking, they’re being polite, right? And even if they really want to know, am I supposed to talk about it here; in the office, in the supermarket?,
I have suffered from , and , on and off since my teens. Now I’m almost 40. I have a career. I’m a senior manager, the breadwinner in my household. People rely on me and I have responsibilities both at work and at home. I am strong, I am reliable, I am there for the people that need me.,
I am also lost and I am tired. But I don’t say this.,
The thing is, I worry, and in that worry I feel hopeless and helpless. My thoughts are dark and full of fear. If I tell you how I feel then you will worry too and I can’t stand the thought that you will feel the way I do and that it will be because of me. So I say nothing, and the moment is lost.,
However, the conversation doesn’t have to go like that. What about if we ask, ‘how are you really?’, ‘do you want to go for coffee and have a chat?’ ‘How about we have an honest , in a safe place?’,I can only wear my mask for so long. If you ,, there’s a good chance I’ll let it slip and you just might be able to help me to find the light again."
"Adam, ","October 10 marks World Mental Health Day and this year’s focus is on ,. As someone who was diagnosed at 16 and struggles with mental health problems in my daily life, both with , and ,, I welcome this news and firmly believe youth mental health needs more focus and attention in the media and public eye.,There’s still an attitude amongst many that people can be too young to experience mental health problems, and struggles are frivolously labelled as “phases” that people will grow out of in due course. I have been told by some that my mental illness is not serious, therefore it is clear that stigma remains amongst some people. No matter what your age you can suffer with a mental health problem and no struggle should be seen as invalid on the basis of age. ,From my own experience, I only realised I was struggling when my mum picked up on it and I really wish the education was there. Throughout ,we had countless assemblies and talks around drugs, alcohol, internet safety and sex education, however absolutely nothing around mental health. The chances are many students, like me, were and are struggling without even knowing and not getting the help they need. Only now because I am aware of my condition do I understand how it affects me and how to cope.,Mental illness affects my life on a daily basis and particularly the decisions I make. My anxiety means I struggle to go out, meet new people and subsequently form friendships with people. This is turn makes me more isolated and continues that vicious cycle of feeling anxious and depressed. While now I am more open, so many people suffer in silence when struggling with a mental illness and I want to use my experiences to raise awareness and encourage those people to speak out themselves. Nobody should be ashamed to have a mental health problem!,If youngsters are given no information about mental health, we simply cannot expect them to take mental health seriously or know when themselves or someone else is struggling. My school also followed the same trend: there were no lessons, assemblies or even conversations about mental health. It’s no surprise that the people who were open about their struggles were “frowned upon” and discriminated against for talking about their emotions. Schools, teachers and parents should make sure that young people are talking about mental health, and aware of it, from an early stage., With the year’s focus on young people, I am hoping to set-up a stall in a local college and use an interactive activity to engage with students and staff around the campus. My plan is to gather a number of Time to Change resources, including tip cards, posters and banner and start conversations that way. Let’s use this year’s World Mental Health Day as the springboard for increasing conversation around mental health and making it easier for young people."
"Ryan, ","Today I am going to respond to a social media post about me. I'm going to do it with dignity, and not resort to name calling. I am not going to name the person, or show the post, as I don't think that would help. I will say that it is someone who knows me and doesn't like me. ,
Simply, I must write this. I must put my thoughts down to help me process my anger, process my sadness. But also, it highlights again the , around , and mental health in general. This is how I am choosing to deal with it. So, I thought I would answer each of the points in turn, again, not just for me but also for all sufferers:,
“It’s embarrassing to be 50 and you don’t work.”,Yes, you're right, I don't ,. If you count work as a job you get paid to do. By that definition, I don't work. But I do, I work. I work every day. I have been ill for four years now, and I have worked every day; worked to cope, worked to carry on, worked to try to get better. Sometimes it is a big thing, sometimes it is a little thing. I do as much as I can do, every day. Sometimes I don't do anything, and that's because that is all I can do that day.,But even when I am not doing anything, I am still working. I am working to drown out the thoughts that say horrible things. I am working to drown out the , thoughts. I am working to find ways to ignore the thoughts that tell me I have nothing to look forward to in life. And I don't get a day off. I don't get weekends off, or holidays, or a sick day for being sick. ,
I have tried so many things to get better. It is important to me that people see that, even if I don't get better, that I have tried. I have tried counselling (five different counsellors), peer support groups, CBT, exercise for health, mindfulness, guided visualisation meditation and been in an adult mental health hospital. Some days I couldn't attend because I was not well enough, but I have always tried my best. I have not just sat at home waiting to get better or given up on ever getting well.,
I also volunteer. I work; for free. I don't have to. I choose to, in the hope that it will help my recovery. I do it because I like it - it gives my life purpose at a time where that's in very short supply. ,
So, I take it back. You are wrong. I do work. A LOT. ,
“Crying in your room at 50, lol.”,Yes, you're right. I do cry. I cry a lot actually. It's not something that I am particularly proud of, but also, it's not something I am necessarily ashamed of. I cry at more things than I used to, but I also have more things to cry about than I used to. Sometimes it's too much. Sometimes life is too hard. I struggle every day to cope with even the simplest of things. I am SO tired. Four years, non-stop. Relentless. I cry in despair, I cry in anguish, I cry in hopelessness at a situation that I can't see a way out of. I cry in frustration at the things I can't do anymore. I strike myself because I am so frustrated, and I cry when I do that. I cry at the pain I cause myself. I cry because I hate myself and then I strike myself because I hate myself. ,
But I also cry because it's good for me to let out all those emotions. The feeling of letting them go is a release to me, even if it is only for a small moment. Because I must. Because doing it saves me. Doing it drags me from the edge, makes me stop tumbling into oblivion, allows me to breathe for a bit. Instead of the edge of a cliff, I sit on the top of a mountain and catch a breath of fresh air. ,
So yes, I do cry.,
So, please don't judge me. You have no idea what I am going through. Actually no, please do, because I will use this to get better. Your ignorance and stigma will inspire me to continue to fight, to continue to get better, so that one day I can throw it back in your face. , "
"Ola, ","Just because it’s called a mental health problem, it doesn't mean that I’m ‘mental’. ,
I hate the word mental. There are so many , that surround it; to call a person mental is to call them mad, or out of control, or ludicrous. Yet, unfortunately, I have a condition that is defined as a mental health problem; I have ,.,
In reality, I knew I did long before I actually got diagnosed. Let’s be honest, it’s hardly positive to have thoughts of wishing to simply not exist (or as I call them, ‘Bad Thoughts’.) However, because of the stigma behind the diagnosis, it took me years to even contemplate going to the doctors. I was so scared. From past experience, people would respond to the idea of depression as individuals simply feeling ‘sad’, or even just making up these emotions ‘for attention’. Then it would go to the other extreme of suggesting that I could be ‘crazy'. Trust me, it doesn't exactly instill confidence in those wanting to disclose this information to others.,
It wasn’t until a particularly bad time, that I decided I actually had to go and seek help from professionals. It had begun to affect my ability at ,, and it was getting ridiculous how long I had already left it. Always the procrastinator, I suppose. Nonetheless, and this is the important bit, I did go and get the help I so badly needed. I got a counsellor and began to actually start speaking everything through. ,
Before all of this, I literally would not really tell anyone about my feelings, but now…well, I would rather say it and be honest, than pretend to be someone else. Everyone needs help sometimes, and that doesn’t make them a remotely weak person. I sometimes still struggle to deal with that perception of myself, but trust me, a large reason for the continuous stigma is the lack of conversation about it. Once you , to ,, and family, you realise how many people have been through similar situations, or didn’t actually understand it in the first place. Since then, I’ve been asked multiple times about my condition and about what it involves. ,
I’m a normal person, a strong person and an able person. Yes, sometimes I can be affected when my depression comes in waves, but I have found ways, and am always looking for new ways, to cope. It is a medical condition and needs more understanding. You wouldn’t go up to an asthmatic, and suggest that they are making up their breathing problem, so why is it okay to do that to someone with any mental health issue? ,
 ,
Depression doesn’t define me, but it is part of me, and trust me, I’m not ‘mad’., "
"Zach, ","It’s a question I often ask myself. Should I be honest? Lay all my cards on the table? Do my closest friends and family need to know every little detail about my struggle? If I did tell them, would they even care? Or would they just give me the generic responses I’d heard my whole life? “Everyone feels like that”, “No one likes work, you just do it”, and the ever popular “Man up!” After all they probably have their own issues to deal with, right?,From as far back as I can remember, I’ve always struggled with my mental health. As a child, I suffered with insomnia brought on by ,. This would manifest in a range of worries; “What if my parents get a divorce?”, “What if I can’t pass that spelling test in school?”, “Will I ever develop super powers?”. As you can see these were some pretty serious concerns. Ones that a six-year-old boy certainly wasn’t going to answer.,Over time these concerns developed and became much more serious; “What if I die in my sleep?”, “What if I’m left on my own?” and “Do I deserve love?”. This little voice of self-doubt I had always lived with had done its job. It had managed to turn me into a self-loathing, angry teenager who wasn’t very nice to be around. I readily accepted this as the person I was and the person I was always going to be.,It wasn’t until my grandfather died, that the weight of the world truly became too much for my shoulders, and I finally crumbled under the pressure. I remember that day like it was only yesterday. I woke up from another restless sleep and after staring at my social media account for an hour, I headed downstairs. That day felt different. It was harder to move, my stomach hurt, and a wave of sickness washed over me. Then out of nowhere, tears began to stream down my face and the air failed to leave my lungs. As I fell to the floor in a broken mess, my ,flew in from out of nowhere. With a concerned look on her face - that look which only a mother can have - she held me and asked a simple question: “are you ok?”. In that moment those words, which I’m certain I’d heard before, felt like the warmest of hugs and I uttered the words; “I want to die” - I felt ashamed.,Before I knew it, I was sat in the doctor’s office, discussing my thoughts and feelings - not something I was particularly comfortable with at the time. So, what if I was depressed? That’s fine right? The doctor would give me some medication and then I’d be back to my normal self. I had to admit, I never thought I’d suffer from depression. After all, I’m strong willed and the people who suffer from , are weak right? Another shameful moment of my inexperienced mind. My , played a huge role in my recovery; a group of people who were loving, kind and understanding. If it wasn’t for those people, I wouldn’t be here today.,So, where do I start when it comes to talking about living with mental illness? For me, it begins with accepting myself for who I am. Sharing my thoughts and feelings, both positive and negative, with the people closest to me. Start small, after all you don’t have to share everything in one conversation. Believe me when I say I understand. I understand that opening yourself up, even to the people closest to you, can be scary. But it can also be an amazing feeling once you do. Mental illness doesn’t define who you are. In fact, it’s a very small part of what makes you, you."
"Natasha, ","If you'd asked me about my mental health a year ago, I would have told you I was fine when really, I was struggling. I had a mental illness and I was hiding it. I didn't want to tell anyone because I didn't want people to think I was weird, dangerous or ""crazy"". The stigma has resulted in me feeling excluded and unable to fit in. It has made me feel isolated and like there is something wrong with me.,If you ask me now I will tell you I have anxiety and ,, in some ways that's scary but at the same time I've accepted that I have a mental illness. I'll be open about it because I feel like by talking about my own journey I can help change the way mental illnesses are perceived.,
Battling your own mind is one of the hardest things you can do. People with mental illnesses are some of the strongest people you will ever meet. Life with depression is like the ocean - it's unpredictable, it can be frightening but there are moments of stillness.,
At first it was hard to talk about my illness because I didn't think it would happen to me. I often say that when talking about my mental health, because I didn't. I live in a great city, have a good job, close, and yet it happened to me. I turned into someone I didn't recognise and went from being content myself to being afraid of my own mind. No one ever thinks it will happen to them. They can spend so long fighting alone, living in fear of their own mind. I felt guilty because I thought others had it harder than me. I found it hard to come to terms with that, but I realised mental illnesses do not discriminate, they can happen to anyone at anytime.,
When I was diagnosed a weight was lifted off my shoulders because I didn't feel alone anymore. I felt like the bubble that was my mental illness had been popped and it was being addressed. The diagnosis made me realise that my mental health journey had really started six years earlier. When I tried to speak about my , I was told that it happened to everyone my age and I'd grow out of it. I tried again a few years later to talk about my anxiety and was again dismissed. I was made to believe what was happening to me was normal and I had to simply get on with it.,I don't want anyone to go through or feel what I have. No one should be ignored or turned away like I was. These last nine months after being diagnosed have been full of ups and downs but now I will openly ,. If I can help one person or change one person's attitude towards mental health through my actions then that means everything to me."
"Katie, ","This is probably one of the most powerful phrases about mental illness that I have heard. For anyone that thinks , is a temporary emotion, just like happiness or anger, think again. Depression is an illness and nothing to be ashamed of.,
I admit that growing up, I did not fully appreciate what it was like to be depressed. I assumed that it was said when you were extremely sad, because I think that is the impression given from the media and everyone around us. What I didn’t appreciate, is the feeling of emptiness. It is great that there are a lot more campaigns around mental illness these days, but I would still say that more should be done to raise awareness from an early age. ,I can be a lot more open about my mental health now, however, I think to some degree there is still an element of shame. Just recently, I was asked which medication I took. Knowing that the individual most likely wouldn't know the name of the medication, I said Sertraline, rather than saying I took anti-depressants. It was nothing to do with not trusting the individual or wanting them to know, but more a natural response due to the perceived stigma attached with mental illness in society. By being more open, I find that it actually initiates a conversation and there are definitely people out there willing to talk and offer support, which is really encouraging. I have learned from my mistake!,
Depression is not the only poorly understood mental illness. Another illness I suffer from is , (OCD), which too has a lot of misconceptions. Living with OCD is like living with a monster inside your brain, that controls the way you think. Similarly, to depression, OCD is not a trait. Many people use ‘OCD’ as an adjective, which can be degrading for someone living with the disorder.,I have had first-hand experience of someone using ‘OCD’ wrongly in a sentence, even with them knowing that I myself had OCD! “That’s my OCD” should NOT be used in a sentence regarding a personal preference, such as always using a ruler to draw lines. This is an example of a stereotypical assumption that OCD is a trait whereby you like things to be neat. I like things to be neat and tidy, that is my personality. I would be neat and tidy whether I had OCD or not – this is an example of a misconception that needs to be realigned.,Society on a whole see the compulsive rituals of hand washing, cleaning and checking and think that that is all there is to it. What people don't see or understand, is the obsessions that cause the overwhelming anxiety. One symptom I previously experienced was intrusive thoughts whilst driving. I would have powerful thoughts and images of myself swerving my car into pedestrians or oncoming traffic, forcing me to talk to myself, tap on the steering wheel and check the mirror multiple times, in an attempt to get rid of the accompanying feelings of anxiety. I would find myself crying at the wheel and becoming increasingly distressed, due to the feeling of being out of control and swallowed up by the OCD inside of me.,
OCD I guess could be likened to an iceberg. The tip of the iceberg, visible to all are the compulsions such as; tapping, counting and washing. Under the surface of the water, not visible but still a big part of the structure, are the obsessions such as; fear of contamination, fear of causing harm to others and the feeling that something bad is going to happen. It is very easy to focus on things that are superficial and visible, but it is what is anchoring these behaviours, that are the main problem – and this is what the general public should be educated about.,
I hope this blog can provide a useful insight into living with mental illnesses such as depression and OCD. Most importantly, I hope it can be shared with others with the purpose of eliminating stigma and educating society, so those with mental illness don’t have to live in shame."
"Andy, ","“Men don’t get ,”.,
Wrong.,They do. I should know.,My name is Andy. I’m married to my wonderful wife, Sam, and I have a two-and-a-bit year-old toddler, Ben. And for the first year of Ben’s life, I suffered first post-natal depression, and then full-blown clinical ,.,It’s easy for men to be somewhat ‘forgotten’ in the whirlwind that is becoming a parent; the pre-natal classes focus on childbirth, the early weeks of parenthood - and for dads-to-be, on how to help your partner through the experience. All of that is useful information, but nowhere is there any guidance on how your life will change utterly as a new father. You are, to some extent, ,. To ‘man up’, in other words.,At the time Ben was born, I was working a high-stress job in public relations, renting a flat in an expensive London borough, and struggling to pay the bills; all while saving for a wedding.,And then, seemingly overnight, we went from two full salaries to one. The number of mouths to feed went up to three, over two, and I went from one demanding job, to two: PR Account Manager, and father. Because, be in no doubt, in the early months, being a father is a job. It’s challenging, demanding, and requires long hours and many sleepless nights. ,I didn’t feel the magical ‘connection’ to Ben that the books say you should. I got in from work to the sound of a baby screaming, and spent the next 12 hours helping my wife feed, change, and quiet my boy. Then, I got a few hours of sleep, and went back to the office. I was exhausted, stressed, stretched - and pretending like everything was okay. I had to ‘man-up’, after all.,I didn’t notice my mood becoming darker, or that I would dread going home just in time for my boy’s ‘witching hour’, when he would yell and cry for no reason. My appetite was off. I didn’t want to socialise. I laughed it all off as the ‘fun’ of being a new father. I had post-natal depression. But men don’t get that - do they?,By the sixth month, my , was suffering. My employers were calling me into meetings; feeding my ,. I started to feel targeted as being a low performer. And then I’d go home, and help Sam look after Ben. Then back to the office, to face more meetings, more criticism, more perceived nit-picking. Eventually, it got too much. ,I took a look at my email queue; watched five more arrive within a minute, and broke down. I ran to a downstairs office, curled up in a corner, and sobbed. I had a panic attack. I clawed at my skull, until a little blood stained my fingernails. I didn’t call my wife, or my parents. I had to ‘man-up,’ after all - right?,That was my mistake - and one I’m hoping telling my story will help other men avoid. I should have told Sam sooner. I should have talked to my doctor sooner. Instead, I hid it all. And as a result, it got worse. Sometimes, I felt like running away. Eventually I was caught sobbing at work. I broke down again and again that day. I was ‘too far gone’ - I was depressed. I needed help. I felt like an utter failure.,So, I got some help. It took two months before I could access much, though. If only I had , sooner...I took a course in cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT); I went onto anti-depressants. Things got better. I quit the poisonous atmosphere of my job in PR, and returned to a previous employer in a new, and less high-stress position. Things got better. I worked hard to be the husband and father my family deserves. ,And I did it. I beat depression. I locked the monster away in my mind, and I watch for its return. But, more than anything, I wish I had acted earlier. I didn’t need to ‘man-up’, or endure. I should have asked for help.,Don’t make the same mistakes I did.,If you’re to become a father, or know someone who is, remember these facts, and act: men do get post-natal depression. Men do suffer tremendous pressure when they become fathers. Men will try to hide it, in an attempt to ‘man up’.,So, , - and then ask again when the automatic reply is inevitably: “I’m fine”. He might not be, but with your help, he could be."
"Malcolm , ","Through all of my life I have wanted to help people, whether that be in a physical way or a psychological one. It has been my goal since recovering from depression, and will always be my goal for as long as I am alive, to help people understand mental health, and to remove the terrible stigma which still surrounds mental illness.,For some people is like a black cloud which sits over them and they are always being rained on. For others it could seem like they are worthless and do not fit into society, either because they choose a different lifestyle to which their family and friends have adopted or maybe it is just because they are unable to express themselves.,When I was going through ,, my work would suffer: I would feint an illness so I could have a day off just because I was unable to face that day, the problem was when I was due to , the next day , would make me panic. I never felt able to talk about my mental health: I would find another excuse not to go or get someone to call for me to say I was still unwell. The problem of course got even worse and I would end up either losing or leaving my job.,Because I was genuinely unwell, my doctors would always write the sick note, but until I actually got that note in my hand I would panic in fear that they would say I was ok to return to work. I would find a job, I lasted 3 months or so and then it would all start again.,In 2008 after a long period off sick with serious mental health problems and numerous visits and stays in mental health units my life I believed was over. I went and stayed with friends for a few months and then decided to try again. I got a job moved back to my house and started to rebuild my life.,Unfortunately, within a few weeks I badly injured my back, so I was off work again but this time it was a physical injury and all the people from before who didn't understand seemed to be more sympathetic as they could see what was wrong.,I awoke one day looked out of the window and thought to myself, why are you doing this to yourself? Was I to blame for your father dying, no. Was I to blame for my wife passing away? No. Was it my fault that most of my family had gone? No. Then why was I punishing myself?,I found a cleaning job in a cricket club. Then I started working the bar, then doing maintenance work. One day someone asked if I could paint their fence, which I did, and more people asked if I could do some work within 3 months I had started HandyMacs gardening and small job business, it ran for 6 years and I ended up with regular customers and 4 contracts.,I had survived, I had another chance and I was not going to waste it. Although my small business came to an end because I just couldn't physically do it anymore, I found full time work with a cleaning company, now I am still working, my bills are paid on time and I can honestly say I take no medication and I’ve been depression free for 8 whole years.,The reason I am telling you this is because there is still a stigma surrounding depression. It has to stop! We have to learn to understand what it is like for someone who feels they are worthless and mean nothing.,Remember disability is not always a loss of a limb or a terrible incurable disease.  Depression can be a disability. It is unseen: there is no bandage, there is no plaster cast, but it is a serious illness. People who have depression are sometimes unable to function in daily life.,If you know someone who is suffering and maybe you have shied away, go to them, listen to them, talk to them. Yes, it’s hard to do, but it doesn’t take much. The person who is suffering just wants you to listen, they do not want sympathy, nor expect you to understand."
"Georgia, ","Living with a mental illness can be extremely isolating and lonely. The relationship is two-way: others may not reach out as you have been understandably distant due to feeling unwell, and you may not contact others for the same reasons. It’s a vicious cycle.,
 ,
I find it very hard to open up and express my feelings. Having , means that I feel like I am worthless, carrying around in my head that I am “unworthy” of other people. If I feel worthless, I’m not likely to contact others as I don’t feel I deserve their attention.,
 ,
During my gap year I felt very, very isolated. I’d taken a year off as I knew I wasn’t well enough to go to university. All my school friends were doing other things and starting to live their new lives. Yet I was stuck, in some ways getting worse. I spent most of my year trapped in crippling social anxiety. I had little social contact outside my immediate family, even being too anxious to be served by cashiers. Life was very restricted. Friends were understandably busy, and I was slipping into feeling more worthless.,Although social contact was hard, messages from other people meant the world to me, but they were few and far between. It would have helped so much if more people had reached out and asked how I was, even if at the time all I could respond was “not great”.,
 ,
The #AskTwice campaign can have such a great impact, as the simple act of someone really asking how I was would have really helped me in my isolated year. It would have made me feel that I wasn’t alone, and that people did care. To me, the campaign requires action by both those who ask and the receiver. When I started to be more open about things I was struggling with, more people started to check in and find out how I was doing. ,
 ,
Sometimes it isn’t as straightforward as “How are you?”, as we are so used to saying “Fine, thanks” in response. I am naturally reserved, and one ask alone wouldn’t be inviting enough for me to talk about things that are bothering me. This is likely due to the stigma around talking about negative feelings and thoughts, ones that everyone has but feels too ashamed to share. My close friends ask how my weekend was, how university is going, what I did at the weekend. This invites me to start talking about anything so that I might start to open up about how I’ve been doing. They are able to show me that they do want to listen to me, leaving the door open to discuss what I feel I am able to.,
 ,
I’ve started to make a difference in my responses when people ask how I am. If I am having a rough time, I’ll try to respond that I am. It allows other people to feel more comfortable in knowing that they can share their true feelings too, breaking the cycle of the “Fine, thanks” response that dominates our interactions.,
 ,
The #AskTwice campaign can have such a widespread effect, as not only does it give a platform for those who are unwell to be listened to, but it makes us all aware that not everyone is “Fine” all the time.,
 ,
One reason the stigma around talking about mental health persists is that often people feel they don’t know what to say to someone who is struggling. However, all that is needed is the ability to listen – you don’t need to try and fix the problem. Check in with friends and make sure to #AskTwice to show that you really do care and are ready to listen."
"Karen, ","I feel like I’ve lost a lot of things to ,: time, energy, motivation. But none of these compares with the feeling that I lose myself and my identity when I’m depressed.,I’ve always been an over-achiever and a perfectionist. I would go above and beyond to help people. I rarely missed a day at my job. I was the responsible one and the one other people could count on. Except when I was depressed.,On the days when I was depressed, I could barely find enough motivation to take a shower. Achieving everyday things was difficult. Getting myself out the door to , felt almost impossible. Taking care of other people was almost out of the question because I could hardly take care of myself.,As the days of depression stretched on into weeks and months and years, it felt like I had lost the person I thought I was. I was the perfectionist, but now I couldn’t care about anything enough to worry whether it was perfect or not.,Who was I? How could depression change me so much? Would I ever be ‘myself’ again?,There was a lot of guilt attached to this feeling of losing my identity. For as long as I could, I pretended to others that nothing was different. I pretended to be the same person I always was because I didn’t want to disappoint anyone. I didn’t want to hurt the people I loved by showing them this new self. I still wanted to be the one they could count on.,Finally, I reached the point where I couldn’t pretend any longer. I was too lethargic, too hopeless, and just too tired to act like my old self. I didn’t know who the new me was or how people would react, but I couldn’t keep the mask in place any longer.,It was hard to ,. Depression isn’t pretty. Instead of telling people that everything was alright, I had to tell them that everything was about as far from alright as it could be. It was hard to watch their faces change as they tried to process these words coming from someone they thought was ‘fine’.,But opening up about my depression and letting other people see the real me was one of the best things I could have done. The burden of secrecy was gone, and I found that the people closest to me were willing to support me through my depression. They weren’t disappointed that I wasn’t the person I used to be. They just wanted to help me find my way back out of depression.,I wish I could say that all of this made my depression go away, but it didn’t. It’s better, but I still get depressed. It lasts for days usually and not months, so I’m thankful for that. The most important thing for me, though, is what I learned about my identity.,Depression takes a lot away from people and that includes a sense of self. I lost who I was through my depression and felt guilty for it. But it wasn’t my fault. Just like other diseases might take away someone’s ability to go on with life like they used to, depression takes away my ability to act like the person I’m used to being. My real self is still there, somewhere underneath my depressed self. Depression does not define who I am.,I also learned that I don’t have to hide my depression. I don’t have to pretend to be something I’m not. When I allowed people to see what I was really feeling, I found that they loved and supported me anyway. I wish I had done that sooner.,If you know someone who is depressed, please realize that it is depression that has changed them. , even if they don’t seem like the person you used to know. They didn’t choose depression, and they need you to be there for them. Allow them to be themselves, whatever that means, and remind them that you still care."
"Khali, ","Living with Asperger syndrome (AS) and mental health issues is not an easy feat. It never is. Imagine yourself in a room full of people. All those people are laughing and mingling. Meanwhile, you aren’t. You’re sitting there in the corner all alone, watching everyone make nice with each other. Nobody even acknowledges that you’re there.,You just sit there, crushed from the inside. You have trouble expressing yourself because you don’t know how to. Your fear of being rejected eats you up. Your fear or feeling inadequate to others eats you up. As you live with these issues, those whom you’re around can’t understand your pain. You’re constantly feeling glum and angry. You feel as if this condition drags you into an abyss that leads to no return.,Growing up, I never was able to fit in. As a kid, I couldn’t look an adult in the eye. I never had the capacity to. There was just something about looking at another person that made me feel very uncomfortable. In social situations, my heart would pound very fast. I always got nervous. I would often be left out because I couldn’t relate to the other children. Being bullied didn’t help curb my condition; it only worsened it. Every day, I would get humiliated. I would be made fun of because of the way I talked, walked, and looked. Imagine trying to answer a question in class and people mocked you. Every word you would say, they’d make this expression that tries to rob you of your voice.,As I was around my family, they couldn’t relate to my conditions either. I constantly sent them cries for help and they just rejected me. Nobody listened. This made me feel terrible. Growing up as a black man, mental health was something people around me chastised. They ,, so they tried to dismiss me by telling me that I’m ‘acting white’ and ‘retarded’. Truth of the matter is, mental illness runs on both sides of my family, so I don’t understand why they tried to shy away from that. During my therapy for anger management, I got diagnosed with , when I was still a teenager.,I attempted to , at 10 or 11 years old, but my mum stopped me. From then, I would use writing as my means to communicate. I loved it. In class, I would be the first person to get up and share what I’d written. I impressed my teachers with my impeccable writing abilities. My creativity was amplified. There was nothing limiting it.,That didn’t mean my issues with my low self-esteem and the inability to become proactive in social situations waned. The kids would call me all sorts of demeaning names, such as retarded, stupid, and many more. I lost my father when I was just a year old, and his loss alone has had a grave impact on how I grew up. As a black man, growing up without a father - that’s not easy. My father was very outgoing. Everyone loved him. He was so resilient. Everyone tells me I look like him, but I’m the complete opposite. I’m not as outgoing as he was; I’m reclusive and shy. I don’t open up too much.,These issues with my mental health, bullying and my bout with Asperger’s did not cease. At the age of 14, I was booked into a mental health hospital. They had me on medication for a while, in attempt to curb my depression and ,, but this didn’t help me. I stopped taking them in 2013. Once I got to high school, I was on the verge of giving up. I carried all this baggage. I bared all these wounds. Nobody understood my story but, I didn’t stop writing. I let my talent carry me to first base.,I let the arts influence me. Writing was my only escape. It was the only place I could go and not be judged. Little did I know, this escape pushed me to write my first book at the age of 15. That book marked my coming of age and how much I’ve matured. It was living proof that I wasn’t going to let my disorders define me. They told me that I wouldn’t be able to function once I got to high school. All these specialists who doubted me - I proved them wrong.,Fast forward to now, I have written over 80 books. I’m aiming to publish a hundred. I am now also attending a prestigious college. I have a message for you all. Never let your circumstances define who you are: you can be anything!"
"Shauna, ","When you look at this picture you probably see a happy girl enjoying a night out with her partner. What you don’t see is the story behind the picture. Three days before, I had a nervous breakdown and had just been signed off work with , and ,.,The theatre tickets were booked months in advance to celebrate our fifth anniversary, and my , thought that going might help me feel a little brighter. Before the show I had an anxiety attack. I barely remember the show itself but do remember looking at the exits and wanting to escape.,Four days before this picture I went to my doctors for a routine appointment. I had been suffering with depression for 10 years but had always struggled on regardless of how I was feeling. That day I admitted to my doctor I was seriously struggling to cope and although my doctor wanted to sign me off work, I declined.,The next day I went to , as normal but asked to speak to my manager as I was worried about my job performance and wanted to give her a heads up that I wasn’t feeling the greatest. In my 8 years with the company I had never let my depression affect my work and I was terrified of the thought of being off sick.,It was 3pm before my manager had time to talk to me and too me into a little room. My manager was in shock. I was happy and upbeat, and was the last person she ever thought would struggle with such severe depression and sit in front of her crying, calling herself a failure. I left work that day feeling relieved that, but also completely lifeless.,Both before and after that day I suffered severe suicidal thoughts and anxiety. Although I had lots of wonderful people in my life I no longer wanted to live it. The doctor described it as my head being broken, just in the same way as people break an arm or a leg. However, the issue with mental health is that no-one can see the extent of the damage. Without the support of my partner, family, , and manager, I am not sure I would still be here today.,The weeks and months that followed were extremely difficult and involved yoga, counselling and a change of anti-depressants but gradually I started to feel like Shauna again. At the start my aim was to try and leave the house on a daily basis regardless of whether I ventured to the shops or a little walk. The anxiety I felt while in crowds was overwhelming but gradually it started to get easier and I started to get my confidence back again.,Four months later I made it back to work. Everyone had been excellent and although no-one knew what the problem was, they know it was mental health related and that I will tell them when I am ready.,It’s now almost a year after my breakdown and feeling much more like my old self and have made plans for the summer and can see a future again. I still have my bad days when I just want to cry and stay in bed but, but I will tell my family, partner and my manager I am having them. I have also accepted that it is likely my depression will never fully go away and when I look back at how bad things got, I have a renewed sense of determination to live my life to its fullest.,I get asked a lot what triggered my breakdown but the truth is there was no one thing that triggered it. Lots of little things built up over time until one day I couldn’t keep going. I always hid my mental health issues, viewed them as my dirty little secret and thought if people knew, they would think I was a weak person and a complete failure.,My depression makes me more resilient but also more understanding of how people around me might be feeling. I don’t want sympathy or for people to feel sorry for me but I want to raise awareness for mental health and depression.,The picture at the start of my story is to show that just because someone looks ok on the outside, it doesn’t mean they are. If writing this makes one person sit down to ,, then writing this has served its purpose."
"Claire, ","When my very much wanted and precious , was born two years ago, after a difficult pregnancy, we both suffered from an infection and were in hospital for a week.,As overjoyed as I was to have my dear little girl, I felt numb and overwhelmed. I did not have a family support network, as my mum was ill with vascular dementia and my father was bedbound from a stroke.,The lack of sleep and effectively trying to look after a tiny baby by myself whilst my partner went back to work to look after us financially took its toll. I felt exhausted and lost. After talking to my doctor, I was diagnosed with , and they suggested that I took anti-depressants.,The guilt and stigma associated with PND is hard, and living in a rural area, I felt very alone, days would go by where I would only see my partner as well as my daughter. Having an adorable girl felt like such a gift, and I didn't want people to think I was ungrateful or didn't feel blessed. I also didn't want to be seen as someone who couldn't cope. At the time I just wanted to be able to speak to my mother and ask her advice but I could not. Leaving the house was also equally as hard.,All new mothers experience some , of course, but I was terrified, especially during the early days. I remember a van had parked on a pavement on a bend, which meant I had to walk in the road with the pram. That was a really hard thing for me to do, but luckily another person kindly stopped for me and watched the traffic whilst waiting for me to pass.,
I want to reach out to other new mummies out there who may also be struggling and, or be too embarrassed to reach out. It’s hard suffering from mental illness at any time, but it is absolutely nothing to be ashamed of. No matter what the situation or circumstances.,It took me a while to bond with my daughter but now I love her with all my heart. I have found that mindfulness sessions at the local women’s centre and practising gratitude regularly has helped. If a mum is struggling she may stay quiet and not talk about it. This is often because they fear being judged. They might think they will be seen as an unfit mum, as someone not capable of looking after their baby. They might fear having their child taken away from them.,I don't think the media helps by painting this perfect picture of motherhood, where it's all soft filters and roses! Motherhood is rewarding but it’s also hard. Sometimes more for others, and that's when a mum needs the support the most.,Because new mums often stay silent, it’s helpful to be aware of any signs that may indicate PND and be open about it. I think talking about it just gets it out there. I hope that the more we , the less taboo it is. We should not feel ashamed or weak to admit that we are struggling.,I would like to think that if I just reached out to one mum, then I have done what I have set out to do. And I would hate to think of others, like me, who felt like I did and battled it by themselves."
"Ruth, ","Some people with ,are made to feel like it is their fault for feeling the way they do and are told to simply ‘get out more’ and ‘snap out of it’. Similarly, those who have ,or ,are told to ‘pull themselves together’ and to ‘stop worrying over little things’. From the surface this advice may seem like it does little damage to the overall image of mental illness but, in reality, it generates stigma towards it and actually does more harm than good.,
 ,
I know this because it happened to me. When I was going through depression I had people telling me to get over it and wanting me to brush off what I was going through. But  it was extremely difficult to do that. It felt like there was a constant dark cloud above my head that wouldn’t go away no matter how hard I tried to ease my mind. There were days when I felt that it wasn’t worth it to get out of bed because all the energy and motivation that I once had had been diminished. Simply trying to carry out everyday tasks required a huge amount of effort due to the overwhelming amount of emotional pain that I was experiencing. ,
 ,
I experienced this period of depression for just over a year and a half. At first I kept it to myself because I thought it was just a short-term problem that would soon be over. But it wasn't. It started to hugely affect me and I soon found it difficult to cope. It began affecting various aspects of my life such as my relationship with my ,, ,as well as my progress at ,.  So one day I decided that enough was enough and went to my gp to get help. Although my family were not supportive when they eventually found out, I gradually picked myself up and started to become more self-aware. Even though I still find myself having some down days, I now have a higher level of emotional intelligence and I am much more conscious of the general concept of mental illness as I have gone through one myself.,
 ,
But this is only one story about a young person who has experienced a mental illness. In reality, mental illness is actually pretty common among youth. For instance, figures show that 20% of adolescents may experience a mental health problem in a given year. This increase in mental health issues amongst youth may stem from a range of issues such as being severely bullied, experiencing some kind of trauma from a young age or by having a gene that makes an individual more vulnerable and predisposed to mental illness.,
 ,
The fact that mental health problems amongst youth are on the rise greatly concerns me. As it happened to me I know just how difficult it can be. It can be difficult to tell someone close to you if they aren't aware about mental health and they don’t have a clear holistic view about it. My parents grew up in a completely different time and culture to me so they are not completely aware of the general concept of mental health and illness. Therefore, they were not able to give me all the advice that I wanted to hear and the courage that I so desperately needed. But from what I know now I know it’s not their fault and I’ve learnt to have compassion for them as they were not exposed to the knowledge and information that I’ve been exposed to today.,
 ,
So whether or not you feel that yourself or anybody that you know may be suffering from a mental health problem, do not simply ignore it. Do some research on mental health and ask yourself and others how they are because the mind is a powerful component and can manifest itself in many different ways.  "
,"""Crazy Eddie"" is a nickname one of my British , gave me when I was attending primary school in West Africa, in an end of term review. I faked laughing along as I was mocked, as I had become accustomed to it, and beamed a deceitful smile. It became one of the few coping mechanisms I adopted while in denial. However, the embarrassment I used to face at that particular school was not always humoured like this.,
A previous West African teacher felt they could embarrass me out of my condition, which of course made it worse. My father informed the teacher of my condition, which had been diagnosed as hyperactivity disorder when I was five. The teacher then broadcast it to the class in my presence. I was only 10 and it was the first time I had ever heard about this, as my parents did not inform me. Consequently, I became the ""class idiot"" and punchline by both teachers and pupils.,
Following this, we returned to the United Kingdom, where I was born. I faced similar bullying by schoolmates and teachers alike. Gradually, I dreaded the thought of attending school. Of course, I never articulated any of this. I internalised the stigmatisation I received, and with my ,. I didn't like or respect myself, and it led to me tolerating and complying with a lot of abusive behaviour directed towards me. I also became unexplainably anti-social towards those around me, not being able to articulate what was troubling me.,
As I matured, the embarrassments grew heavier and more evident. I'd remember back to when I was nicknamed ""Crazy Eddie"" as a child, and it seemed easier to laugh off without needing an explanation. Multiple exams were resat, I was let go from various jobs and I avoided social interaction wherever possible. ,
Then, I was diagnosed with , as an adult. Later when I was out of work, I was diagnosed with , and ,. The most recent diagnosis has been Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The real shame behind these conditions isn't mine.,It's my belief that had the ADD been diagnosed when I was a child, alongside the H, the other co-morbidities may not have developed. All it boiled down to was that I have a shorter supply of blood flow to the pre-frontal cortex of my brain. This part controls primarily personality expression, decision making, and moderating social behaviour.,
After finding effective treatment, I began to simplify my condition this way. I became able to voice it towards those around me; my relationships became stronger and my other co-morbidities decreased.,One of my relatives once said ‘it is a shame’ that I have ADHD. I don't feel the shame lies with me having this treatable condition. It lies with the people who used my condition against me, treated me abusively because of it and dismissed my various cries for help over the years.,
A major part of overcoming all of this was embracing being ""Crazy Eddie"", rather than feeling ashamed and angry about it. I then started to genuinely laugh and smile along with everybody else around me. I am now 34."
"Karen, ","A year ago, I was one of those people who, if someone was stressed or depressed, would probably have thought: “What do they have to be depressed about?”,Now, having experienced , first hand, I can see just how harmful those words can be, and yet I’ve no doubt much of the time they’re not said with any sort of malice. It’s an honest question from someone who doesn’t understand. Unless you’ve experienced this yourself how could you possibly understand it. I barely understand it myself and I know what it is.,My depression was triggered following a difficult period at work and it took quite some time for me to realise that I was experiencing stress and depression. I knew something wasn’t right, but I wasn’t initially sure why I was stressed. Then I realised it was about ‘control’, or, more accurately, a ‘lack of control’ in my current job. ,I had a return to , interview with my manager following a few days of absence with stress. I thought long and hard about whether to be honest about why I was off sick, but decided I should be able to talk about it. Unfortunately for me that experience was a negative one. It would be difficult for me to fully explain just how much this affected me, but at that time I needed some support and to feel that someone cared and got neither.,My symptoms have included being sad to the point where it has actually felt like grief, a physical pain, lots of tears, frustration, feeling alone, problems sleeping, feeling worthless and having no purpose and feeling exhausted. And my confidence and self-esteem hit rock bottom. ,I was at my worst between August 2017 and January 2018 (although it’s all such a blur). I went from not caring if I existed or not, to wanting to not exist, through to becoming very preoccupied with researching what I could do to not exist. I was in so much pain I just wanted it to end.,Then of course there’s the guilt, as on the face of it: ‘What have I got to be depressed about?” ,No-one has died, I have a lovely family, and others would say that I have a good job that pays well. But something’s wrong. Having previously been someone who would have thought “they need to just snap out of it”, I now realise it really isn’t that simple. If I could I would, no-one would choose to feel this way.,Now that I’m feeling a little better I’ve finally managed to ,. Mainly because they’ve disclosed that they have also been unwell and so I feel I can trust them not to judge me. I’ve struggled to confide in people as I think they’ll either not believe or understand me, or they’ll see me as weak. I also don’t want to be a burden or to upset people. So when people have asked “how are you?”, I always say ‘”I’m fine”.,I read something recently which was written by someone who has experienced depression. They spoke about the fact that if you’re depressed, you’re not necessarily crying and wailing 24/7. There are moments of genuine happiness and then there are moments when you appear to be happy.,Some of us put on a mask in order to get through the day, and therefore some people would be shocked to know that we are suffering from depression. “They’ve managed to come to work” and “they’re smiling and joking”. We smile and joke because we want to appear ‘normal’ and we don’t want anyone to know we’re suffering. Although at the same time we’d love people to understand that we are suffering and we need support! Keeping it to yourself is exhausting.,Explaining how you feel to a GP is difficult as they can’t see any physical symptoms. And because of this, we start to wonder if we are depressed or whether we’re just a fraud!"
"Andrea, ","There are so many things we learn when we’re younger.,We learn how to talk, how to colour in the lines and how to ride a bike. We learn the difference between a curly ‘C’ and a kicking ‘K’. We learn why we shouldn’t get the toast of out the toaster with a metal knife (if you didn’t learn this, don’t do it).,
As we get older we learn about love and ,, and explore the world a little more. We learn about the importance of money management and the importance of eating our five a day.,
However, one thing many of us don’t learn about is mental health.,Unless you’ve experienced struggles with your mental health, many of us aren’t taught from a young age how to look after it. Many of us aren’t taught how to discuss mental health in a respectful manner, or how to support our friends or family in their experiences.,
So many people I speak to aren’t aware that every single one of us has mental health, just as we all have physical health.,
I think if we were to do a survey regarding illness, it would be straightforward to name a wide range of common physical illnesses. In TV adverts we see a handful of products available to buy to alleviate physical illness symptoms.,Yet if I asked you to name a list of common mental illnesses, more people would probably struggle, and herein lies the problem. If we don’t educate then we will never rid these stigmatising notions, stereotypical views and common misconceptions. It is scary to think that a part of our body we all need to nourish, many ignore.,Mental illness is a broad term because it covers a whole range of illnesses, many of which are still deemed taboo. This has to change.,
When I think back to my experience of stigma and negativity towards my health, I honestly have to say the majority of views come from a lack of understanding. There are a handful of people who are just rude, small-minded and mean, but on the whole I believe that stigmatising views derive from a lack of knowledge. The more people could understand, the less they would fear and I’d like to think the more they would support.,Some comments I’ve had in the past include:,I do believe the majority of these views could be changed with some education. What are people expecting when they say I don’t look like somebody that has a mental illness? Somebody with their head clutched in their hands? Hair unbrushed and rocking in the corner?,These outdated ideas are only changed when we talk. When approximately 1 in 4 people in the UK experience mental health problems, I firmly believe we owe it to all generations to have this discussion now. The more we discuss these things, the less we reinforce these damaging views to younger generations and the more we can give older generations a new way of thinking.,When I was growing up, if I had heard others talking about anything that resembled the struggles I was experiencing then I would have opened up much sooner. I believe my , would have been more supportive and understanding. They would have known that my experiences weren’t rare or dangerous but just symptoms of an illness.,I have recently been diagnosed with , and , and I found myself confused and scared. I believe that by talking openly about my experiences, I can help others feel less alone and a whole lot more normal – because that’s what we are.,
Just because you may experience mental health problems does not make you strange or abnormal, it makes you human. Believe me, there are more people than you think that share these experiences. I may get things wrong sometimes, may not use the correct terms for things, but what I can offer is honesty and a promise that you are not alone in how you feel.,
Growing up, we may not have learnt much about mental health problems amidst our , of nouns and verbs but education doesn’t end at ,. I’m starting to learn about my new diagnoses, about the importance of looking after my mental health and just how common mental illness is. For anyone hiding their experiences for fear of being alone, the best lesson I have learnt is that we’re not.,The brain is complex, clever and often confusing but no matter how alone your thoughts make you feel, there is a big wide world out there with so many others that understand. Remember, it’s okay to talk."
"Sarah, ","I have recently completed a 7-week CBT group therapy programme and am currently taking medication for severe , and ,. However, it took me a long time to talk about my mental health issues. About 6 years in fact.,I was always the academic, “pretty” and friendly one. This put an enormous amount of pressure on me to maintain a certain perception of myself and to hide the issues and demons that I was struggling with, including difficulties with poor body image.,I have very supportive , and ,, but for years I felt that if I opened up about how my mind was suffering that I would be a burden on them. I never knew how to explain how or why I was feeling so low all the time, and how to ask for help. At ,, , or at ,, I didn't feel that there was a safe and comfortable environment to be able to talk. I didn’t think that anyone would understand me.,I felt that I had to hide how I was struggling because there was nothing for people to physically see. But my anxiety and depression had many visible effects, such as causing me to sleep too much, isolate myself from social interactions, lose interest in doing anything, have a poor appetite, and develop an obsession over my weight.,People seemed to misunderstand these behaviours for me being moody, miserable, boring and lazy, and some people’s responses to them were quite unhelpful: “Why are you so miserable all the time” and “all you do is sleep”. It isn’t easy to hear those words, because it’s so difficult to explain why you feel like the only thing you want to do is close the bedroom blinds and curl up under the cover in the dark.,I avoided any sort of social activities considered “normal” for a 19-year-old; to the point I moved home after my first year of university. Whilst my flatmates joined in with fresher activities, I would make excuses to stay in the flat alone. This was such a sharp contrast to the previous year where I would be out near enough every day at a different pub or bar. At this point of partying all the time I was acting out and trying to maintain a false image of myself. I felt so low and uncomfortable in the body I am in, I made unhealthy decisions.,As I continued to hide my mental health problems, I became very distance from my best friends and my , suffered. I felt so alone and that I was bringing everyone around me down with me. By pretending to be “fine”, it felt like a vicious circle that I couldn’t get out of for so long.,Everyone has ups and downs, and good days and bad days, and so I didn't want to sound like I was being dramatic. I was also worried that I would be judged or not taken seriously because I didn't think my mental illness was as bad or extreme as some people who suffer much worse. In some way I felt that mental illness was categorized into serious and not serious.,What you don’t realise, is that so many people do and will understand. The anxiety I felt about the initial conversation was much worse than the conversation itself. I was worried that opening up to my mum and doctor would be totally embarrassing and awkward. In fact, it felt like the whole world had been lifted off my shoulders.,Those initial conversations opened up the door to getting the professional help I needed, and on the whole, reactions to me talking about my mental health were very genuinely supportive. My friends are understanding and patient with my anxiety and depression. They may not all relate but they do their best to identify when I need some support, and just ask me how I am doing.,Negative labels and terms for mental health are often thrown around so lightly that it makes it difficult for someone to say that they are struggling. People need to choose their words more carefully, and stop to think why someone is acting differently, and make a point to sit down and have a conversation rather than assuming that someone is “being moody all the time”."
"Daniel, ","As a professional boxer, most people around me only see the finale – me stepping into the ring, in great physical shape and performing well under the lights and cameras. Amidst the occasion, it is easy to assume that everything is fine.,As my family and , watch me compete, my true state of mind is not really questioned. And so, I continue to war with my 'lower thoughts' just as I do in the ring, alone.,To be honest, whether I was asked how I was feeling wouldn’t hold much baring as I don’t want those close to worry about my sanity or keep a watchful eye on me. I don’t want to be wrapped up in a blanket. I don’t want to be treated differently or receive sympathy. I don’t want to be a cause for concern or considered vulnerable.,Going by the reaction of the public and my peer group to when celebrities or mutual friends are struggling with their mental health, I get the impression that people expect the individual in question to be able to maintain control of their sanity systematically. An inability to do so suggests a 'feebleness' and a 'failure' to pull the strings in one’s own brain. This can be frowned upon or even mocked.,I think this is what separates mental health issues with physical health issues. If an individual had an illness that we could see, sympathy and concern would dominate our emotions. Forgive the assumption, but I believe the general population are better programmed to accept them as victims as ‘nothing’ can be done for those suffering. The outcome is out of their control. However, when it comes to mental health, sympathy and concern can be found amongst other reactions. Such as teasing, exaggerating and pouring scorn upon those affected.,I make a calculation, and I decide I want to spread positive thoughts, optimism, smiles and laughter. So, I easily ignore any notion of sharing my true feelings even if I don’t completely shut them out.,Poetry helps me express myself to myself and is very therapeutic to me, a form of release that allows me to identify with greater scrutiny what exactly the underlying issue is. I find my poetry is more honest than my conversations, hence the darker tone of my poems.,I recall telling a friend I wrote poetry as a form of therapy. The response was being labelled ‘feminine’, along with a chuckle. These comments make people go further into their shell, facing the dark alone.,I also remember as a , I was depressed. I was told I knew nothing about , and was dismissed, swiftly. Maybe I didn’t know what depression was at such a young age but what I did know was that I was in battle with something within that I was struggling to gain a monopoly over. I managed to get through it, but there are numerous people who do not.,Mental health can affect you, your home, upbringing, work place, child. So, don’t be quick to dismiss someone. Just like double checking you have locked the front door, do that with your fellow human being. Double check they are ok before you proceed.,It is important for people going through things to realise they are not alone. I try to treat my negative thoughts like my opponents. I can't let them win, I refuse to accept defeat, I will persevere until I am victorious. Any previous wars with myself will only better prepare me and strengthen me for my next one.,It is a routine one-man process for me most of the time, but I am sure if I wasn’t against opening up, things would be a lot easier for me. Sometimes it is easiest for me to share with people that are not the ones closest to me, people I don’t necessarily see every day. I would rather avoid sympathy and people fussing over me. Extra attention is not my goal.,The more people that share their experiences the less people will feel isolated. , and building understanding could definitely save lives. My message to those struggling silently is to share it, but I can only speak for myself. Another’s remedy may differ to mine, whatever your outlet or release may be, use it."
"Rhiannon, ","I am ashamed to say that most of my life I have ignored mental health stigma. I am even more ashamed to say that what has woken me up to it, has been my personal experience.,Why so ashamed you might say? We all only tend to care about something once it affects us personally.,True, but it did affect me personally. My , battled mental illness for twenty years. That was twenty years of witnessing it up-close-and-personal. Twenty years of attempting to support her. Twenty years of seeing, hearing and feeling her pain.,Yet it’s only now that I am angry about the stigma that surrounds her illness and millions of others. It’s only through plunging into a severe depressive episode and coming out the other side, that I’ve realised I was a part of that problem. It’s only now that I’ve chosen to fight it.,I’m so sorry about that sis. But better late than never, I guess.,Fighting the stigma doesn’t have to mean placards or speeches or rallies. It doesn’t have to be the big, public gestures or brave declarations. ,: putting an end to that agonizing silence.,Although I supported my sister through many challenging stages of her illness, what I never did was openly talk to her about her experiences. I’ve realised now that the silence was compounding the stigma that already exists and adding to her sense of shame.,Having been through the hardest eighteen months of my life, I am now on the way to recovery from severe , and ,. In my efforts to reach out, to talk and to write about what I’ve been through, I have been met positively in so many ways.,Encouragement. Support. Gratitude. Admiration. I’ve been shown it all. And I’ve been so grateful for it. Every. Single. Time.,But there have been other responses that have surprised me. Intrigued me. And, yes, disappointed me.,When unwell, I was met with silence to texts or emails in which I ,. Nothing else. There was no drama in those messages. No desperation. Just simple suggestions. A walk. A coffee. A conversation. Anything to end the intense isolation and loneliness that comes with depression.,Having shared brutally honest articles I’ve had published on Facebook, I’ve had some lovely feedback in the comments section. Intriguingly though, I also get private messages. They are positive, encouraging and supportive. Yet private. I totally understand the need for privacy when someone shares something personal, but I find it difficult to understand when they are purely supportive.,I have been constantly congratulated for my courage in speaking up. Don’t get me wrong, I appreciate the support. Especially as it is hard to be so open, and it does take courage. But it shouldn’t need to take courage. It’s that damn stigma again making courage necessary.,We don’t all need to become self-declared mental health advocates who shout about it from the rooftops. But there are things we can do.,If someone talks about their mental health to you, be receptive, be open. If you don’t get it, fine. Just by listening you will show acceptance and help to reduce the stigma. And, unless they do it, don’t feel the need to shut the door or lower the volume of your voice. If they are happy to be open about it, don’t discourage it.,Make mental health a normal part of conversation with ,. Help them learn to name and identify their emotions. If they cry, avoid your protective instinct, and allow them to feel and express their pain. Discuss how they deal with anxiety or moments of stress. Model having time out when it all gets too much. Children observe and learn from our every move. If we show it is ok to talk about metal health, they will hopefully be more open.,If you connect with an article, a quote or a meme about mental health, like it, love it, share it, comment publicly and encourage others to do the same thing. It’s amazing how often I get a limited response until one person comments. That seems to open the floodgates and others comment too. Don’t be afraid to be the first person – take the lead!,When you ask someone how they are, really listen to their response. Look at their body language, follow your gut. If their “fine thanks” wasn’t quite right, suggest a walk, a coffee or a chat. And don’t be afraid to start the conversation:,If someone reaches out to you, please try not to be frightened by it. Check that they have the ,, make your boundaries clear but don’t just disappear. Even the odd encouraging text message can make such a difference to limiting loneliness."
"Emily, ","The last time I wrote a blog for Time to Change was when I was 19. I’m now 24 and there’s something I need to talk to you about.,Nine years ago, I was diagnosed with , and ,. I started having these feelings when I first went into ,. It all feels like such a long time ago now, but I’ve had time to reflect on the last nine years of my diagnosis.,The first thing I notice is that, suddenly, you become reminiscent of a ticking time bomb. You find that people are walking on eggshells around you because they are afraid that they might say something to upset you. This is okay - not everyone understands, and that’s okay.,From walking on eggshells, you’ll get people asking questions. Again, this is okay. People should be able to ask you questions, if it helps them to empathise and understand what you are going through. One thing that isn’t okay, which I have experienced throughout my diagnosis, is the question of why I feel the way I do.,I asked myself that question a lot when I was first diagnosed. I thought that I was getting these feelings because of my age or because of the stress of school. I thought things would get better in time. After all, I had ‘no reason to feel this way’.,But I soon came to the realisation that this is something I will probably have for the rest of my life, and that’s okay. I’m very lucky to be surrounded by a wealth of love and support. I’m lucky to be employed by a company that takes your mental health seriously.,I am a massive advocate of ,, but the slightest knock-back can have dire consequences. Not everyone in the world is going to be understanding or empathetic about mental health, and a lot of people will be asking you why you feel the way you do and worse; telling you that you shouldn’t be feeling the way you do.,The problem with mental health stigmatisation is that often you will be ,. You might have a good upbringing or went to a good school. You might have a huge circle of friends and a wonderful family. Therefore, ‘you have no reason to feel this way’. And they’re right. I don’t have any reason to feel this way. And I don’t need to have any reason to feel this way. I do and I can’t help it.,People will often forget that mental illnesses can be biological - they’re not just based on bad experiences. So actually, in the words of Lady Gaga, I ‘probably’ was born this way.,1. People with mental illness have zero obligation to explain themselves if they’re in a bad way.,2. People with mental illness shouldn’t be judged based on how good they have it in their life.,I had a good upbringing, I went to a good school, I have great friends and a lovely family. I’m also depressed and I’m anxious, and that’s okay."
"Jess, ","It’s ironic that on Mental Health Awareness Week for 2018 I’ve been signed off sick from ,. It wasn’t intentional but it is symbolic. People suffering from mental health problems push themselves too hard for too long trying to pretend that things are OK, pulling a shroud of secrecy over their lives in the hope that people don’t find out how they’re really feeling.,Objectively, there is no shame in being depressed, or anxious, or overwhelmed by stress, but these states of mind create a sense of guilt which can be all consuming. It comes from nowhere and you can’t put your finger on why it’s there. Why should I feel guilty about something which is hurting me? I didn’t ask for this. No-one asks for this, and yet here we are. It happens, and it’s becoming more and more common. The prevalence of it in the workplace, amongst friends and family and partners, is really surprising to me. Until now, it has only ever been my problem.,My experience of , and , has been long term, damaging, undignified and ugly but ultimately ended with my recovery. It took place over several years and at times it felt futile and pointless. Years of medication use left me with health problems and terrible anxiety after the ten month withdrawal process. Returning to life un-medicated was overwhelming and uncomfortable, like stepping out into blinding sunlight after being in a dark room. I don’t know how I persevered, only that I think I knew that a difficult recovery was still better than being ill.,Slowly, I began to build resilience and hope. I gained a huge amount of personal insight through counselling and talking therapy, which I think is one of the most important things a person can engage with when they’re suffering. I began eating properly, looking after myself, seeing my friends and making new ones. One night, after two years of recovery, , told me that I was finally like myself again. I had been ill since the age of 17, and now, at 25, I had recovered.,And now it has come back. There is nothing more frustrating and soul destroying than a relapse for someone who has spent years recovering and had a brief glimpse of what it’s like to be well. To have that taken away from you feels unbearable. Suddenly my symptoms were returning; fatigue, poor concentration, an overwhelming sense of despair and hopelessness. My sleep was becoming disrupted, waking at one or two in the morning and staying awake for several hours. My appetite waned, causing a viscous cycle of fatigue, low blood sugar and worsening mood. The anger, which I’d always thought was irrational and stupid, also returned. I was so frustrated with what I saw as my useless mind, which so quickly became overloaded and seemed to grind to a halt.,What does a depressive episode feel like? Everything feels relentless, suffocating and hopeless. I am afraid of being judged by people for being ill and so I withdraw, and the depression feeds on that secrecy. I feel lost and powerless, ashamed of mistakes I made and for being back in this place. Everything is too bright, and too loud. I am frustrated that I haven’t found a way to manage this, either this time or the last time or the time before that, and I blame myself for that too. Emotions feel too big and I feel too small to hold them. The depression hangs heavy over me and the anxiety is like a wailing siren behind my eye, stopping me from feeling safe and keeping me in a constant state of alertness and stress. I worry about what I’ll lose this time around and what I’ve already lost. It’s the most isolating position a person can be in, because it’s all inside my head.,. I can’t be bothered with the secrecy anymore because it eats you up. There is no shame in feeling this way and there are a lot of people and organisations pushing to reduce the stigma around mental illness. I was one of them four years ago, and I’ll be one again now. There are people who will read this and will recognise their own experiences in mine, and there are people who’ll read this and won’t be able to comprehend how horrible this feels. For the people who are suffering – keep going. Pushing through and seeking help isn’t easy but it’s worth it. Talk to people. See your GP, and if they’re unsympathetic book straight in to see a different one. Don’t let anyone tell you that you’re imagining it, or that you’re weak. Being brave never feels brave at the time. You will feel relief again. You will feel OK again.,For the people who aren't suffering, be aware of your friends, family and colleagues. Has someone become quiet recently, and withdrawn from you? Are they picking at their food or looking tired and drained but not giving an obvious reason for this? Don't feel you need to pry, just ask if they're OK. Ask if they'd like a cup of tea or a chat or to go to the cinema. Tell them you're there for them if they need you, and repeat that enough to make them know you mean it (we never believe it when people tell us the first time). People will open up to you when the feelings become less heavy, and to be with another person who is being kind will often do that. When they do speak to you, listen to them and allow them to be frustrated and resistant to the idea that things will change. These feelings are exhausting and they do make things look like they will never get better.,The best way to break down the shame and the isolation for someone is to be there, to be sympathetic, and to remind them that they will get through it. Often just knowing that there is someone to lean on if they need it allows people to start the process of getting back onto their feet. To support someone during a period of mental ill health is one of the most powerful things you can do, and something you should be proud of."
"Adrian, ","“It’s just a few tics, don’t worry about it” was one male friend’s response to my writing about life with Tourette’s. That was someone meaning well. The ignorance, misconception and dismissive attitude towards mental health and neurological issues are far worse online. Progress has definitely been made in encouraging men to talk about mental health but more effort needs to be made in showing people how to listen.  ,There is as much misconception about Tourette’s as there is about mental health issues. I’ve experienced it since the age of 9 and seen it go from obscurity to part of popular culture for the wrong reasons. Around 10% of people with Tourette’s involuntarily swear and even amongst those who do, there are many others facets of the condition impacting them every day. I’m far more likely to swear at someone saying “it must be so funny having Tourette’s” for the thousandth time. For me, Tourette’s is physical tics in every part of my body, some minor but thousands of times a day, others violent and painful. I can hold them in better than most, but they still come out daily when I’m alone or walking down the street.,Besides the physical and vocal tics, there are regular migraines, sensory issues and utter exhaustion. Successfully holding it in takes the majority of my focus and energy each day, while actually ticcing puts a physical strain on you. The relentless nature of the condition makes you prone to mental health issues and I have experienced ,, ,and severe , for many years. It is often difficult to know which is causing which. Depression can even bring a numbness that helps ease the tics, but that’s a fairly dark silver lining. As with mental health, the contrast between what is going on inside and what people see is striking. Some of the hardest parts about depression are the isolation of dealing with it alone, the lack of understanding and assumptions people make. It’s not a coincidence I seem fine most the time in front of people, it’s how I plan my life.,The sensory issues in particular lead to a lot of anxiety. In busy situations I have found my senses just overload and suddenly I can’t process information. I can’t see or hear properly and just walking down the street becomes an ordeal. This happened at a social event recently in a crowded bar where I found I could no long pick out anyone’s voices and had to concentrate hard just to stay standing. The knowledge that this can happen brings an extra layer of anxiety to social situations.,I’ve found it more difficult to ,. While the majority would not say anything negative, the main reaction is silence. There are plenty of other men I know who I wouldn’t even try to discuss it with and some who regularly make dismissive comments about mental health in general. Like most people to discuss mental health and personal struggle in public I have received plenty of calls to ‘man up’. I watch too much football, go to the gym and do many of the things men are supposed to do. Yet I can’t man up because I like wine, theatre and nuance. I’m sure the need to reinforce masculinity to that extent comes with its own deep-rooted insecurity. It’s also making it more difficult for other people to discuss their experiences and ultimately, costing lives. The fact I’ve given it that much thought probably reflects my inability to successfully ‘man up’.,For decades, we’ve seen people unable to talk and suicides among young men rise. I have one or two male , who have asked more questions and been keen to listen but talking to women has been far easier overall. With a quarter of us experiencing mental health issues at some point, there’s no reason gender should make any difference. In one case, the fact I had written about my experiences encouraged a male friend to talk about their own struggles. That is the main positive for me. It didn’t lead to any solutions, neither of us necessarily had the answers or any advice, but we were heard and understood a little more.,There is too much pressure to inspire and be positive when it comes to mental health. We all want to be positive and make it through difficult times, but that won’t happen if we can’t discuss the reality of how difficult it can be. There will always be those difficult days where you can’t bring yourself to exercise even though you know it might help. Adding that extra layer of guilt helps no one. Mental health and neurological conditions remain extremely complex. Yet we can all help for free simply by removing assumptions and actually taking the time to listen to people."
"Nik, ","""I felt I didn't have any right to talk about my own issues."",shares his experience of mental health problems and the stigma attached to mental health in the Serbian community: "
"Tash, ","Dear colleagues,,I am sorry.,I realise that my behaviour has impacted those around me, both in the past, and also more recently. I don’t make excuses for the hurt that I’ve caused. And so, I’m writing you this letter because I want you to understand. Because you deserve an explanation and I think this is the best way to give you that explanation. You are honest with me and it is only fair that I do the same.,Having to pretend that I don’t ever feel sad, anxious, overwhelmed, or even panicked is not healthy. It is also incredibly exhausting, in all honesty. Up until now, I haven't admitted what has been going on because I thought I could carry on and cope. For the best part I do manage. However, like recently, every so often I hit a rough patch and as hard as I try to prevent it from happening, that spills over into my , life.,This is ,. If you aren’t sure what to say, you don’t need to say anything at all. , turns you into someone even you don't recognise. ,, but I hope it helps you to make sense of the way I may sometimes behave. It is never my intention at the time, but the fact remains that I have hurt people. And that is completely inexcusable.,I’ve imagined sharing this a thousand different times; during , around the coffee machine or after particularly stressful meetings. I’ve pictured myself blurting it out in a moment of need. But I held back, again and again. I was afraid of what you might say, or not say, back to me. Instead, I swallowed it down with, “No, I’m fine. I’m just tired today.” My mental illness has made me behave in a way that I am ashamed of. It turns me into a person even I don't recognise.,I’m sorry for pushing you away when you reached out to help me or needed me to help you. I may have made you feel that the help you were offering was not what I needed. You probably didn’t know how to help, and I did little to enlighten you. Defeated, you withdrew from me. I don’t blame you for that in retrospect.,I’m sorry for casting a dark shadow over such a great working environment. I poisoned your happy thoughts with negativity at every turn and I feel truly saddened by this realisation. I’m sorry for not being more helpful when you needed me to be. I can become so consumed by darkness and as a result I was not available to offer support and encouragement. I expected so much of everyone but offered nothing in return. I am sorry that I become defensive and shut off. I know that this isn't helpful when you are only trying to do your job. You have felt the tension and uncertainty of my darkness. I’m sorry for what you had to endure in doing so.,I cannot go back and change the way I treated you. I cannot take back the mistakes I made or the unforgivable way I have spoken to you. But I am truly sorry for the hurt that I have caused.,Most of the time I can do my job and I believe that I really do a good job. I want to help support the business as it grows and play an instrumental part in that. I promise that if I begin to feel really overwhelmed, anxious, or sad, I’ll come to you with an action plan or ask for extra support. Sometimes, I may need to take sick leave — because I live with a medical condition.,I choose to look at the positives this illness can bring, to not just my personal life, but to my work life. I know that I’m responsible for taking care of myself both at home and at work. And I know that there’s a line between our personal and professional lives.,What I’m asking from you is an open mind, tolerance, and support if, and when, I hit a rough patch. We’re a team, and we’re in this together. In return, I will do my job to my best ability and do what I can to support you to do your job.,Yours,,Tash x"
"Becky, ","I’ve never really talked about my mental health; maybe I’m embarrassed by it or what people will think of me. It often becomes awkward and some people even stop talking to me altogether. Some don’t get it. That’s ok. There’s a lot of illnesses I don’t understand either. Some get annoyed: ‘How can you be sad, what do you have to be sad about, you have a great life. You have me, isn’t that enough for you?’,
If I had a ‘good reason’, like someone had died, you would understand why I was sad. You wouldn’t question it, just accept it and try to help. But because a lot of us don’t have a particular reason, ,. I can tell you it’s none of that. ,
I don’t choose how I am or how I feel. I can’t make myself feel something that I don’t - can any of us? I just don’t have the same emotional processes you do. Mine are broken and I don’t see things how you might. I still love the people in my life, I’m grateful that they are here, but just like it wouldn’t fix a broken leg, it won’t fix my , either. ,
Can you imagine the fear and anxiety of having no control over yourself? Becoming irrational and paranoid for no reason. To have thoughts in your head and you have no idea where they came from. To not know what is real and what isn’t. Sometimes it is just sadness. So , you can’t even be bothered to move. You are utterly consumed by this physical ache and emotion that nothing can break it. Everything is difficult. You feel worthless and pathetic. You know there’s no point to you and nothing matters. ‘Why bother having a shower, I’m ugly, it doesn’t matter to me or anyone if I’m clean. It’s pointless. I just want to stay in bed.’ ,
You don’t want to feel it but how can you ‘snap out of it’? How do you make it go away? , is debilitating. It’s irrational mostly but it’s intense and comes on quickly and sometimes out of the blue, so you’re not even expecting it! Not sleeping doesn’t help, but who can make themselves sleep? Your mind is full to the brim of stuff just going around and round, analysing everything that has happened or been said; ‘Why hasn’t someone texted back? Why didn’t I get invited out? No one likes me. I’m a freak. I’m stupid. I’m a bad person.’,
People tell me: ‘don’t worry’. It can come from a good place, and if I could stop because you’re telling me I can then that would be brilliant. But again, that’s assuming I have control over it and I just don’t. Imagine feeling sick but someone tells you you’re not, so you can feel better now. That’s not going to help or make it stop, it’s only going to confuse you and you’ll probably now hide the fact you’re ill. ,
Yet ,. It helps when there’s ,. It helps to know you’re not alone. It really helps knowing that someone is there for you, even if they don’t have all the answers. I don’t need to be fixed, I just need compassion to be who I am. I truly believe we should all be allowed that."
"Amy, ","Today I woke up and for a moment I lay still, staring at the ceiling. I lay there and felt my chest rise and fall as I breathed. It took all my will power to keep my focus on my breath, a mindfulness technique I have been taught. I did this for 30 seconds, maybe a minute, as my , got up for the baby.,I was lying there, trying to keep my focus off the one thing that has dominated my thoughts recently. The dark, dismal feelings that have clawed their way into my life and that bring with them the thoughts that I just can’t go on anymore. These thoughts bring with them tears and heartbreak and they make living a normal life more and more difficult.,
My , has made me prone to ,. It is a lifelong battle, but as my husband carries my beautiful son into our room, that battle must be put on hold. Despite my turmoil, my son is not going to see me cry.,I take a deep breath and put my mask on for the day; as so many people do who suffer with mental illness. It is not hard to smile when my little boy is around. To the outside world it would be hard to know that my life is blackened with depression - and that is how it must be!,
But the problem is that truces are temporary and each momentary stand-off is just building for a bigger battle! I can keep this battle going for a while, but not forever. Ultimately there will be a point when all my defenses will fail and I will face that demon again. The one who brings me to my knees and gives me a choice to live and fight or to give in to those thoughts.,
So many people read stories like this and will never understand. They may think: “pull yourself together”, or “how selfish to feel so low when you have so much”. It’s not materialistic, depression! It doesn’t just go away by shrugging it off. It’s an illness, the same as the flu. Annoying, lingering, debilitating and unwelcome!,
Depression has never been easy, but it somehow felt easier when there wasn’t a little human who needed me so completely! Before motherhood I could keep the mask on while I worked, sob on the way home in the car and have a hot bath and curl up on the sofa. Even when I could no longer work there were no problems with me taking to my bed for days at a time. But not anymore!, was the single most wonderful thing I have ever done. He is my world, my entire world, I adore him and he brings me more joy than I ever thought possible! But that joy does not protect me from depression!,What it does mean is that I have a huge reason to keep living, to keep fighting, and that is a beacon of light in the darkness. I have always found hope to be the best weapon to fight depression and my son gives me all the hope I could ever need!,But it doesn’t make it easy when depression comes knocking. That is sometimes the cruelest thing about depression. It doesn't care whether your life is full of love and joy, it still comes, to darken your days.,
Having a baby has made self-care even harder. Not only do I have to keep going for him, I need to keep that mask on for a whole lot longer. The need to rest and recover is slipping down the list of priorities.,Not getting enough sleep has always been a trigger, and all new mums will agree that getting sleep becomes like hunting for the holy grail! My baby is 14 months old and still wakes most nights. This prolonged sleep deprivation is certainly making me feel more exhausted and less able to cope.,It also makes my other coping methods a lot less appealing. Walking and running require energy, which is something I just don’t have at the moment! My books have become dust magnets as I spend my time playing, singing and entertaining my little boy!,It also is a lot harder to hold myself together once that little ray of light has gone to sleep for the night. That’s often when I quietly sob to myself. I feel at my weakest and the battle seems at its most futile.,It’s in these moments when the facade slips and those emotions I suppressed flood to the surface. My rational brain tries to find logic in my sadness and battles to restore order to my emotionally ravaged heart. I fall apart briefly.,That is the way wars go. Somedays progress is made, other days it looks hopeless. Nobody knows who has won until it’s over. Somedays I don't think it will ever be over.,It doesn't matter whether I am winning or losing, it’s the fact I am still fighting that really matters. My little boy comes first, that is why I get up every day. And by continuing to fight there is hope.,I may never defeat depression but I will find a way to keep it in its place. Beneath me, in the dirt where it belongs. From there I will stop surviving and start living. That is the hope; maybe that is all I need."
"Sandra, ","I come from an Indian background and have lived in the UK for over 30 years. In 2007, I was diagnosed with severe , but had had many episodes from 1989 up until then. In 2008, I was then diagnosed with , and have had several relapses since that time. As a result, I am now better informed about my mental illness and know how to seek out and get immediate help and support.,
For a very long time, I hid my mental illness from family and ,. However due to my lengthy admission to hospital in 2007, I was only able to cover up for a month by saying I was attending a course in Manchester. I could not carry on the lie much longer, as the admission went on for a further three months.,
So, what stopped me from telling? Is it because I was ashamed of my mental illness or was it because I was embarrassed by how others might perceive me if they found out? I realised that I also had a preconceived idea about mental illness and I lacked knowledge and understanding of it.,
I felt it was a sign of weakness; I did not want anyone to know that I was weak and that I could not handle what life threw at me. I also felt that my family and friends had succumbed to the age-old culture of keeping mental illness a secret. This is very common among the South Asian community. At one point, I too believed that mental health problems are not to be talked about publicly. I felt the stigma, feared people gossiping behind my back and then there was the reputation of the family at stake.,
My family members weren’t aware of how to support me - I used to put on a very brave face when they visited me. One time, a family member told me ,. I was even advised not to talk to my friends about it as it was ‘not necessary’.,
Almost 20 years later, I find that there is greater understanding of mental health problems among the general population but not so much within ethnic minority or marginalised communities. I applaud how famous people have come forward to talk about their mental health problem openly but it’s still rare to hear stories from ethnic minority groups.,I run small workshops for Asian women on mental health problems. By talking about my own journey, I have been able to create a platform for them to openly share and learn about mental health issues, be it mild to severe depression or even ,.,
There needs to be greater awareness of how to take care of our mental health and wellbeing, including the signs and symptoms of mental health problems, so that people can seek help much earlier. I left it way too late and sought help only when I was at the verge of ,.,
There needs to be greater involvement of family in supporting people with mental health problems. There has to be , between mental health patients, clinicians and family members. Clinicians should be encouraged to get family members involved in the treatment and care plan of their patients.,
Members of my family were there to support me physically, by taking care of my daughter and visiting me, however they were unable to support my mental wellbeing. They would not engage in any , - even to date it is a taboo topic.,
I have valued the support provided by Mind and feel encouraged to be part of their national equality improvement steering group to help create positive change. This in turn, has also helped me to better understand and connect with people from other ethnic groups who are facing similar issues."
"Chris, ","I lived a dual life, a private one and a public one, with , for many years. To the outside world I had a great life – a lovely family, successful career and healthy lifestyle. But inside I was battling almost every day to simply survive, thinking I didn’t deserve any of it.,I lived with depression without ever accepting that or really acknowledging it. I suspected deep inside but always pushed it away, never really seeking help and being too scared to admit it. I constantly wore a mask. My acting could probably have won many awards. ,I did my best to hide it and to function without showing the pain inside. I would hide in a meeting room crying, and then go out to hold a presentation without anyone knowing. I would often save the tears until cycling home, when no-one could see. I made excuses to not talk about it at home.,This was odd really, as I used to ,. As a senior leader at , I often spoke to my team about the importance of being open and talking. I did the same as a parent to my ,. I cared that everyone else felt comfortable to talk and knew that it was okay to not be okay.,The problem was that I didn’t include myself.  ,I was working long hours, driven by the harshest of self-critics and self-perfectionist voices, doing more than was expected of me. We had family illnesses that we struggled through, and I never really stopped to consider the impacts they had on my thoughts. I wanted to support everyone else, to be there and help whenever I could.,I think that was partly why I didn’t open up more. It was more important to be strong for others, so I ignored and avoided my own feelings. I saw them as a weakness that was not helpful to anyone. I was also scared to admit I was struggling, with a fear of what would follow if I did.,And I smiled though it all.,I had a session of phone counselling several years back. Looking back, I realise now that I didn’t open up fully in those sessions - never told the full truth of how I felt. It was just treated as a short period of stress. I regret that now. Maybe I didn’t feel I could talk as openly as I can now. ,My smile started to crack during 2016 and by December was completely broken. It was a turning point. With the encouragement of my fabulous , and two work colleagues, I went to the GP and was formally diagnosed with depression. ,Without that encouragement and support from those three people I am not sure what would have happened next. I suspect they saved my life. It took several weeks for me to accept depression was serious and that I really did need help. My GP and therapist have been instrumental in helping with that understanding.,It might seem hard to understand for some: how can you carry on day-to-day with depression? Many people do and they hide it well. We find ways of covering it up and coping, sometimes with bad habits ,Poor sleeping patterns and snacking (especially biscuits!) were some of mine. Feelings would build up and then I would be impatient, irritable or get angry over the most ridiculous thing. That would then be followed by inner recriminations which fed the depression and would lead to emotional pain which I continued to hide.,Now I am learning to manage the depression. It’s hard, it takes time and no one can tell you how long treatments will take. That was hard for me to understand at the start. I was used to plans and working to deadlines. But health doesn’t work like that. There are many things that can help you and hinder you.,Recovery may mean the same as management, and that is okay. You find what works for you.,It really is okay to say if you need help. That can be easier said than done. It’s hard, especially for men and those in positions of authority, to admit a weakness. Even when they know it’s the right thing for them. Actually, it’s a very brave thing to do.,You may be surprised by how many people will support you, even share their own experiences to help. It’s also the kindness and understanding of strangers, peer support and charities that will help to sustain you, alongside family and ,.  ,I am not sure why I didn’t talk about it earlier, as talking about depression is the best thing I ever did. It is ok to reach out for help if you need to. "
"Sam, ","Many people know me as the person who laughs, smiles and jokes. But not many people know me as the person with a mental health condition. The reason for that is that there is no way of telling if somebody has a mental health condition.,In 2014 I first started noticing that I was struggling. Low motivation, low moods, no energy to do things. Also known as ,. The issue is, depression isn’t like a broken leg. You can’t tell just by looking at someone whether or not they have depression. And it was for that very reason that mine went unnoticed by people around me. With the massive stigma surrounding depression, I never told anyone.,Some people think that depression is just a bad day. But actually, it is a long-term mental illness. When I did open up about my depression, many just brushed it off as a bad day. When I had issues with motivation, it was made to look like laziness. Low moods hidden by fake smiles. ,Due to having motivational issues, my attendance in , dropped. Punctuality for me was a major issue. Instead of giving a space to talk, teachers would just question why I was late, in a way that portrayed me as lazy and not caring. One , even said just to “try harder” when I did try to open up about having problems with concentration and motivation.,I didn't feel like there was anybody to open up to at school. Other students teased me, and I feared talking to teachers due to them being obligated to inform parents. Coming from an Asian family, there is a lot of stigma and misunderstanding around mental health. Many think depression is just ‘sadness’ or ‘moodiness’.,Because I was struggling with low moods and lack of motivation, I decided to get counselling through an online organisation. I had counselling for half a year, which then had to come to an end. Although I would definitely say that it was helpful to clear my thoughts and have a better understanding of my own mental health, it didn’t change how I was feeling.,A few months after counselling ended, I had my first experience of being ,. I still remember it like it was last week. Feeling suicidal is something that people can struggle to fully understand unless they've been through it themselves. The feeling of wishing not to be alive so much that you want to end your own life. That night I reached out to a , online to tell her how I was feeling. She listened to me and gave me the opportunity to clear my thoughts.,I find ,, going for long walks whilst listening to music and watching TV helps my mental health. Due to all the issues that were going on at this time, I was unable to do these. ,Many people tell those who are suffering from depression “you just need to get out more” or “you don’t look depressed”. Here’s the problem: I am somebody who spends more time out and about than indoors and I cycle four miles a day. I also laugh more than most people I know. But these things don’t invalidate my depression. These just show how misconstrued depression is.,Depression is more than just sadness. It’s having no feelings at all. It’s overthinking or not being able to think at all. Due to the stigma of mental health, these emotions are not always acknowledged by those around you. Instead of helping, some people tell you to “get over it”. Mental illness is not something you can simply “get over”. ,Where I am on my journey to recovery I’m not sure. One thing I do know is that I am further along than I was this time last year. I am working for a better future for those that will have mental health issues in their life. I want to help shape a future that is stigma free.,Society needs to have a better understanding of mental health and for it to be just as accepted as physical health."
"Katherine, ","I have had serious mental health problems most of my life but despite this I work and live independently.,Feeling part of society has had the single most positive impact on the state of my mental health. Unfortunately, it is the very thing that stigma and prejudice has the most negative impact on.,I have a diagnosis of Borderline Personality Disorder, have experienced ,, mania, , and have made several , attempts and completed many more acts of , just to try and cope with, or sometimes block out, the emotional pain I was feeling., is a little known and even less understood condition within the general population. Sufferers are still often seen as difficult, trouble, badly behaved and, worst of all, attention-seeking.,Seeking attention is a normal part of being human. If someone is asking for this natural need in an unhealthy way, it would be much more constructive if we saw this as an individual’s response to trauma they have experienced. It could help with healing if we did not just view it as self-induced bad behaviour.,This is not to say that I haven’t been a challenge to be around at various points in my life. However, being treated with kindness and respect, and listened to at these times, has had a significantly more positive impact on how I behaved than being treated as some sort of belligerent toddler.,Having a personality disorder diagnosis does not mean that every aspect of my personality is damaged and unhelpful. I have many positive and useful personality traits as well as some troublesome ones, just like everybody else!,I first received mental health treatment at the age of 18 when I was a medical student. Following an overdose, I spent nine months on an acute ward and a year in a therapeutic community for people with a personality disorder diagnosis. If you add up all the time I have spent as an inpatient it comes to 10 years.,I returned to university and gained a degree in Oceanography. After graduating I worked in a specialist dementia resource centre and as a manager of a mental health advocacy service.,At the age of 27 my mental health deteriorated again. At this time, I ran away from hospital and committed a crime. Although I did something potentially dangerous, I didn't harm anyone and had no intention of doing so. It remains the case that people with mental health problems are actually much more likely to be victims of crime. I pleaded guilty and spent some time in prison and as an inpatient.,Since then I have gradually worked my way through the mental health system to where I am now. I was determined to get back to work, live independently and have a ‘normal’ life. I had the support of a mental health employment advisor and I volunteering in various environments for years before applying for paid work.,When I did apply for jobs, I had many interviews for roles that I knew I would be able to do well but , found it difficult to see past my criminal conviction and mental health problems. I persevered and eventually secured a job and moved into my own flat.,
I now work with adults with disabilities and have gained professional teaching qualifications. I have been able to use my life experience positively by emphasising my passion for treating everybody as unique individuals with equal value regardless of difference or disability.,
This opportunity to contribute something to society has had an enormously positive influence on my mental health. Whilst I still have some difficulties, I am also very resilient, hard-working and hopefully an asset to my employer.,
I would urge employers to have an open mind when interviewing applicants with criminal and mental health histories. Look at what they can do, what they have overcome and what positive impact their experiences may have in the workplace.,
Stigma and prejudice are still significant factors that prevent people from feeling part of society, financially independent and less alone. Given that isolation, lack of purpose and poverty are major factors affecting mental health, this seems very unfair.,People who have mental health difficulties are the same as everybody else. Suffering is part of being human and everybody is unique with positive and negative personality traits.,Everyone should be judged on their individual merits, not by a mental health diagnosis. Prejudices are too often still based on myth and fear."
"Zoe, "," and ,, what do they mean to you? There is a lot of coverage on these topics at the moment and, in my opinion, rightly so. Mental health is something that has been affecting so many people, for such a long time, and only now does it feel acceptable to , and open each other’s eyes to the struggles people face daily.,I have suffered with anxiety for many years. I have also probably suffered with depression, although I’ve never been formally diagnosed. For me, I’ve always struggled to open up and tell anyone. Why? Why should I be ashamed of the thoughts and feelings going through my head? Well that’s just the thing; those thoughts and feelings are relative to me. They’re relative to what I am facing and how I manage to deal with those issues.,Yet that doesn’t stop people with the questions; “Why does it bother you? Why can’t you chill out? Why can’t you relax?!” Well, maybe if I had any answers to those questions I wouldn’t feel the way I do. I already feel silly, I already question my emotions on a daily basis, so do you think I need anyone else questioning that? That is why I’m glad people are finally speaking out and finally addressing the questions and the negative opinions surrounding this matter.,What do depression and anxiety mean to me? It means struggling to get out of bed in the morning. It means fighting back the tears while sitting at my desk and putting on a brave face while inside I feel like everything is being screwed up and I can’t breathe. It means trying to concentrate while inside my head I have constant battles and arguments. It means getting angry and pushing away the ones I love the most because I’m adamant they’ll hurt me if I don’t push them away first. It means wanting to sit in a room on my own and not interact with the world but missing everyone and everything at the same time.,I fake my way through most days and some days that gets exhausting to the point where I can no longer put on that brave face. But what I will say is, anxiety doesn’t make me who I am. Sometimes my brain likes to think it does. Some days I feel like I’m not a person, just a shell, but for the most part I will fight. I will fight to be the person I once was. I will fight to be the happiest I have ever been. I will fight to let people in and not shut that door.,I am still me; I’m just a little fragile some days and I just need someone to stop, think and ask, are you ok? And to tell me they’re there. I don’t need advice, I don’t need people telling me I’m “being stupid.” And I most certainly don’t expect you to understand. But by being there, and taking a moment to think, you could save someone’s life. You could be the reason they’ve got a smile on their face. You can make a difference.,It’s time to talk. Don’t shut the world out! Share your stories and help each other - it may surprise you how much you have in common. No one should be alone in this world, ,. "
"Peter, ","At school, while I had a few friends, I often struggled to connect with people. This was mainly down to my parents disapproving of my friends, which led to me isolating myself. I started to sink into deep depression. I didn’t understand how I felt at the time and I did not feel able to talk about my battles with ,and ,, so I put my problems down to general school worries and teenage hormones.,This view was reinforced by my ,and my ,. Rather than confronting my issues, they believed I was a miserable person who just needed to “stop worrying and cheer up” and it was all part of being a teenager. This made me believe that my problems didn’t need to be taken seriously and that eventually they would go away, if I just tried a bit harder.,Unfortunately that wasn’t the case. They didn’t go away, and in fact things started to get even worse as I left school, lost previous friendships and felt no support from my sixth form. I put most of this down to the view that I was a cold person, who couldn’t make friends. So I ended up blaming myself for my own depression.,With nowhere to turn during sixth-form, my time there was miserable. I failed to make friends and it culminated in a panic attack/nervous breakdown as I walked away from a maths exam. Due to the stigma surrounding mental health, I hid what I had experienced during the examination period, and felt a deep sense of shame towards myself for not being able to overcome my anxieties. ,Eventually I managed to scrape through ,, completing an additional year and then getting into university. I began to understand my mental health more at university but this only really started when my dad passed away during my 2, year. This forced me to think more about my mental health as I went through the process of grief and, through speaking with my personal tutor and counsellor, I began to open up more about my feelings. However, this was only related to the grief and I still didn’t talk about my previous history of depression, anxiety and of issues such as ,.,After starting a Master’s course, I gradually pushed myself to meet new people and began to make a few more friendships, which helped me to ,. The more I talked the better I felt and I discovered that the people I was talking too had similar issues and similar histories and didn’t express any stigma towards me or my mental health struggles.,This encouraged me to take on a more proactive role towards my mental health. This include writing about it in my dissertation. I came to realise there were so many therapies and support networks available at university and outside for people with depression and anxiety. I had never even thought of anxiety as something that deserved treatment, but after talking to a councillor and discussing my past and going on a weekly basis to discuss how I was feeling, I began to understand that I did deserve help and my issues were real.,However, I have also become more aware of stigma, and how negative media portrayals can affect both myself and others. Most noticeably, I am resistant to getting labelled as ”depressed” or “bipolar” by the doctor or to be given medication. And I’ve definitely been viewed differently since I began talking more about my mental health. I’ve been pitied, talked down to and viewed as different. But I’ve also been hugely supported within the last year, and felt more courage to talk about my issues, get help for them and learn how to manage them better.,I am hoping that others won’t have to go through the lack of support that I had when I was in school and that people, not just students but staff as well, understand mental health issues better and understand the power that stigma has to affect youngsters. If there had been better education and understanding at my schools towards mental health, then I would have felt more able to talk about these issues with people rather than hiding them away. For me, education and understanding is key to helping those who are struggling. I hope in the future, other students won’t have to go through what I did. "
"Andy, ","Just because I'm a man, doesn't mean I'm immune to mental health.,
The stigma that goes with men and mental health is patronising. People think of mental health in a negative way already, without the labelling of , being 'attention seeking', , as 'you're not depressed, grow up', loneliness as 'stop being quiet, there's nothing wrong', or , as 'stop stressing, take a chill pill'.,
I have learned that there are many reasons why people suffer with each one of those mental health problems. As each day is different, each feeling is different - there are millions of ways day-to-day living impacts our lives. Some people may feel a little worse than others and not know how to cope, while others can pull through at the drop of a hat. No one really knows what's going through people's minds; what they've gone through, or what they are currently going through!,The way that mental health is currently being perceived, means men get overlooked, which makes it ,. That’s certainly what it’s felt like in my position. The way some people make , and distance themselves, from someone who is suffering with mental health problems, often makes the whole matter worse. Especially if the person you thought you could talk to is the one turning their back. My attempts to talk to , and loved ones never worked. I never knew how to explain what was wrong or how I felt because everything just seemed to happen all at once. ,
From being a young teenager, going through high school into , and even recently into my young adulthood, I've battled with mental health problems and self-harm. Dealing with a break up of my own, my parents’ divorce, abusive behaviour, being bullied and the stress of exams, it's fair to say I was overwhelmed. I was finding myself at loose ends, waking up alone and being uninvited to social occasions with ""friends"", just to find out people have spoken negatively about me behind my back.,I was constantly worrying and anxious about when these feelings and negative thoughts would end. It was then when I thought the only cure that could put things right was self-harm. Loneliness and anxiety became the norm. Being on edge, not being able to sleep or eat made me wonder if I was able to carry on... ,
Being depressed isn't something that just happens straight away - I didn't go to sleep one day happy and wake up the next sad. In my case, it was trapped feelings that were building for months, even years. Unable to talk to people, as talking pushed people away, I managed to brace a smile and continue as if things were fine.,
I had a rough start to my adulthood, but I have made progress. In simple terms, going through hell and back gave me the experience and know how to deal with my emotions and what to do when I have a 'surge' of overwhelming feelings taking over - especially when I feel alone.,Having the confidence to talk is something I'm still working on, simply because I am ashamed of my past. As mental health is a part of everyone's life, no one should feel uncomfortable to talk about how they feel and the reasons why. Talking is the main point of contact for people, we do it every day! If words can hurt and create disruptions, they can equally create comfort, peace of mind and help one another to pull through.,Talking about a person’s experience may help someone else who hasn't quite got the courage to yet. Whether that was someone who chose to ignore you when you were the one who needed help, or someone you're close to or friends with, any gender or religion.,If you know how to help, and the opportunity is there, then what's stopping you?"
"Caroline, ","I’ve spent the past 15 years of my career – in recruitment and HR – raising awareness of disability issues in the ,, encouraging individuals to disclose disabilities to employers, coaching partners through assessment and hiring decisions, encouraging candidates to choose a firm where they can show their true self at work and, above all else, selling the supportive culture of the law firms for which I have worked. I’m passionate about diversity and inclusion and have been contributing to the debate professionally for many years. It is through this work that I have long felt – and seen – that law firms need to address the sheer volume of mental health issues which are prevalent in the profession. If we don’t, we run the risk of not attracting or retaining the brightest talent. However, it has taken me a long time to turn the spot light on myself. Why?,
I’ve worked at Norton Rose Fulbright for coming up to five years and I can honestly say that from day one, I felt I could be myself.  The firm has such a great culture that I finally let barriers down. But, even as I write this, I know that I’m not really telling the truth…because until today I have only brought 90% of the real me to the workplace. The other 10% is known by a select few (those in the circle of trust) but it’s probably the part which defines me most – my values, how I treat others, how I view the world. So, despite all of the work which I have done in the diversity space, it was only when I saw that the firm was finally establishing a disability network – “Shine” – that I felt I could share my story. So here’s my big announcement…,
I have suffered from , and , for 23 years.,
There, I’ve said it. And, guess what? There hasn’t been a lightning strike and I haven’t been marched off the premises. Why would I want to hide something which I have been living with, day in, day out, for most of my life? The answer can be summed up in one word: fear. I have always been afraid of how others will judge me, how others may not speak to me in the same way again, how I might be singled out as the person who needs to be treated with kid gloves, how it will affect my career. And here’s the irony. I know that living with and managing my depression has made me stronger, more resilient, more determined, and a better colleague. It defines me and I’m no longer ashamed of admitting that I, along with nearly 1 in 4 people in the UK, suffer from symptoms regularly.,
What does living with depression mean day-to-day? At its worst, it means having to remember to take very good care of myself (getting as much sleep as possible, cutting down on personal commitments, avoiding unnecessary stress, remembering to communicate regularly and honestly with family and ,, checking in with the doctor, taking medication, seeing a therapist, checking in with HR). At its best, it means carrying on as usual (seeing my friends, travelling, enjoying life). ,
There are various reasons why depression and anxiety hits, and it’s different for everyone. For me, it’s sometimes been obvious – for example the loss of a close relative or when a parent was suffering from cancer. At other times, it can hit me like a bullet, with no apparent trigger. And that’s when the hard work really starts – getting back to ‘normal’, using tried and tested coping mechanisms but, most important of all, ,. And, I’m not great at talking about myself. Talking about my beliefs, my interests – yes. Asking for help from others? No. But being more open with work colleagues definitely helps, if only to have someone checking in with me regularly. And, let’s face it, we all need this from time to time, depression or no depression. ,
Why have I finally written this blog? I accept that not everyone will feel comfortable openly talking about mental health issues, ethnicity, sexuality, gender, work-life balance or caring responsibilities.  But disability remains the elephant in the room so let’s think about how we can support our work colleagues who need it, when they need it, and not when they fall down."
"Daniel, ","My gruelling battle with depression has been somewhat of a pilgrimage, without the heavenly resolution at the end of the journey. The experience could be described as a paradox. I savour the essence of being alone. However, that idealism is detrimental to my mental health.,I have a condition called albinism, which meant I was born with a severe lack of skin pigmentation. This was never fully explained to me, which meant I had to navigate being ashamed of my appearance, bullying and ridicule without understanding why. The cruelty I endured caused me to harbour a large amount of insecurity and lack of self-worth. I started to contemplate thoughts of suicide, because I could not comprehend why every time I left my house I was subjected to looks of disgust that I could do nothing to change.,Unfortunately, I was unable to open up to those around me. In an attempt to deflect attention from the elephant in the room, which was my skin condition, I endeavoured to please those around me. I spent the majority of my upbringing being something I was not. Unstable mental health can easily be exacerbated in an environment of isolation. Loneliness fuels the fire of recluse and fans the flame of unhealthy seclusion.,My mental health eventually spiralled out of control when my dear father passed away. His death ripped me apart, and there was not one human being on the planet who had the ability to put me back together again. The pain I felt, and still do, wasn’t just based on his death. To know that no matter what I did, I would never be able to make my dad proud, broke me into pieces. I was able to portray a figure that looked strong, because I despised showing weakness. On the surface, I would smile and project this character of joy. But deep down, my sadness was eating me alive and my mental state was taking a turn for the worse.,My social surroundings were not adequately equipped to handle my broken mental health, particularly in the black male community. It had always been taught that a man must hold in their feelings, avoid being emotionally available and never show signs of weakness. This was the attitude I had adopted and it meant I was bottling up emotions that urgently needed an outlet. Sadly, I was never encouraged to discuss my mental health within my community and instead I became ashamed, even more ashamed of my struggle.,There came a point in my life when I became overwhelmed with putting on this facade. I came to a crossroads, where I had to decide between sheltering this pain in the dark or choosing to bring the issue to light. I felt as if I was at the end of my tether and I began to think even more of suicide, because the idea of ending it all felt more appealing than continuing to live with such agony.,The pivotal moment that instigated my journey toward recovery was rather unexpected. During a random conversation with my family, out of nowhere, I began to break down in tears. It was then that I eventually started to come to terms with my unstable mental health. I was lost, hurt and carrying an unbearable pain, but I finally came to the point where I was able to open up. The reaction from those close to me was mostly positive, and while they may not have been able to completely understand, their support was unwavering and played a major role in my recovery. Truthfully, not every conversation will be positive, but it’s vital you don’t let that deter you.,While many would see being diagnosed with depression as a negative point, it was in fact the best thing that could happen to me, because I finally came to terms with who I was. My voyage with mental health has caused me to face a whirlwind of emotions. It has been filled with joy, sadness, regret and hopelessness. I’ve come to realise that keeping your feelings hidden could ultimately do more damage to your mental state. If you know someone who is struggling, it’s imperative that you create a dialogue with them, and help them realise they are not alone. If there was ever a time to talk about mental health, it is now."
"Millie, ","“But you seem normal, you can’t have ,? I know of someone with that and she can’t work, and she can’t go to Uni.

When I was nine years old I was suicidal.,When I was 12 years old, I began hearing voices that told me to burn objects and clothing items that were of importance to me. I would sit on my bedroom floor clutching my head, rocking back and forth for hours to stop the voices.,When I was 14 years old my paranoia was so severe, I chose to take a lifelong vow to hide whatever was in my head, because if anyone found out then they would kill me.,When I was 15 years old and I let a friend know some things that was happening at home, I got told I was attention seeking. I told my parents I felt , and I was told the same thing.,When I was 16 years old, I was ,. I hallucinated, I felt worthless and I was extremely paranoid that people were trying to kill me, controlling me and were pretending to like me. I had my first manic episode. I couldn’t sleep but I didn’t need to sleep. I started getting into debt and I was risky and careless. I started using drugs regularly – anything I could get my hands on. It was a pure escape and I found I could talk about my feelings for the first time and the next day no one would remember what I had said. ,When I was 18/19, I was using drugs daily. I thought it had been helping me initially but my already severe paranoia was in overdrive. My hallucinations were not as subtle and I had a hard time pretending I could cope with day-to-day life. I hated myself the most at this point. I had dropped out of college three times since school had ended. The only job I had was for four hours in a shop on a Saturday and I hated it. I gave up taking drugs when a friend was clearly addicted and it was making him ill. It was a wake-up call. I was rock bottom. I was abusive to everyone I knew because I was convinced they secretly hated me. My paranoia and depression were still severe and I had developed , and panic disorder alongside these.,At 21, I gained employment. I also had a very severe manic episode where I thought I had the cure for specific diseases. I had unstoppable amounts of energy and I was ‘happy’. I thought I was a special person, chosen for a job most humans were unfit for; to guide the generation into an all-seeing and all-knowing phase. This shortly came crashing down into a very severe depression that I am surprised I survived. I got dismissed unfairly from my , and appealed this. I won. ,Work is a constant battle. I am always changing my hours and shift patterns. , is an even bigger battle; I find it very easy to give up and it takes every single ounce of me to not throw in the towel every time I wake up in the morning but I am continuing to fight through what has ruined many chapters of my life so far.,I had no childhood. I had no teenage years at school; I was not care free and I was not happy. My late teenage years were not “the best years of my life” as everyone says. My early 20s were extremely difficult. I am now in my mid-20s and I am not letting something as insignificant as my diagnosis stand in my way. ,Yes, I have friends.,Yes, I have a job.,Yes, I go to University.,And yes, I do have schizoaffective disorder.,Don’t judge someone who has tried to open up to you; they have probably been through a lot.

"Emma, ","When I was 14 years old, I was suspended two weeks before the official start of the Christmas holidays. I’d been , for months at my boarding school, while firmly believing that I’d been exceptionally secretive.,Fortunately, I was surrounded by a group of people who pulled away every lie and excus, until I had no choice left but to accept help. At the time, I hated them all. Despite the hours that these people had spent trying to understand and support me, I felt deeply betrayed.,“But you had a lovely ,,” said my tearful mother on the excruciating car journey home, in an attempt to make sense of what I’d done.,“Maybe I didn’t,” I replied, feeling simultaneously cruel and vindicated.,This was not true in the slightest. It seems obvious now, but the harm I was inflicting extended far beyond my body. Giving in to my addiction left me feeling scared and lonely, which outwardly manifested as spite and aggression when my secret was exposed.,Discovery was inevitable - behavioural changes don’t go unnoticed for long in the close confines of a single sex boarding school. The first people to intervene were my dormitory ,, who would extract me from bathroom cubicles at 1am and let me talk or cry until I fell asleep. Every morning, I would tell them that it wouldn’t happen again and assure them that no one else needed to know.,One of the most dangerous aspects of my self-harm was that it made me feel smart. During the day, I was outgoing, focussed and high achieving, which must have validated my promises. Reality hit at night, when I relied so heavily on a certain group of friends that they practically had a rota for keeping an eye on me. They gave their time and care selflessly, whilst I piled emotional labour on to them without ever really thinking about their health or wellbeing.,After weeks of trying to help me on their own, my friends were brave and rational enough to tell a member of staff. I was called in for a meeting with the deputy head and referred to the school counsellor. This was my nadir, a period where I constantly lied, continued to self-harm and swung wildly between mania and depression.,Despite my increasingly antisocial behaviour, the support network I had only grew. My older cousin became my big sister, even as her A-levels loomed. My , gave me bags of glow sticks and red marker pens after researching distraction techniques. When I refused to remove my jumper at a cross-country race, my P.E. teacher signed me off sport for as long as I needed. The friends who’d been there from the start continued to endure my rages, tears and silences.,When the , couldn’t legally handle the situation any longer, my parents were called in. My world imploded. I realised that by distancing myself from them, I’d made the ultimate wound. Without time for apologies or gratitude, I found myself unwillingly deposited into the hands of professionals at a mental health treatment centre.,I believe in the remedial effects of psychiatry, but I don’t think I was healed by clinical therapy. In fact, the only thing I remember from the sessions is a swirly brown carpet pattern. My breakthroughs happened because of the support I was given at home, conversations with my friends and letters from my teachers. I returned to school in January for three and a half years of recovery lapses, which ended with a place at a top university. My success is irrefutably tied to the help I received from those people.,I doubt that any of them know how much I appreciated their support and non-judgement. I never told them, perhaps because I was waiting for a significant end point. Nearly ten years on, I still haven’t reached this fabulous conclusion where I am completely free from doubt and ,. All I know for sure is that the level of stability I have now would have been impossible without the care that they provided. It’s as good a time as any to say thank you, you brilliantly kind humans. I was extremely lucky to have you all , when I didn’t want to help myself."
"Symran, ","It's never easy telling someone about your mental health. It's never easy trying to explain the heavy feeling in your chest, the lack of motivation you have, the heavy head and whirlwind of sad thoughts constantly sitting in the back of your head. ,Mental health is something that is not discussed within my , at all. It is a taboo subject that isn't even thought about. I was having a conversation with my Dad before and he said; ', isn't real. Everyone just doesn't talk about their problems anymore so they're sad'. It broke me to hear that because my problem was depression and I did want to talk about it! I don't know if it was a cultural thing, treating mental health as a taboo subject, or if it was a generational thing but it hurt so much knowing this was something I thought I was going to go through on my own. ,
Telling , or , was also difficult. They were supportive but I felt like a burden to them. They never quite understood it either. , was a mystery to them and , were not even a part of their dictionary. Their reaction was more confusion regarding mental health and that's just because they didn't get it. Nobody spoke about it so there was no reason for them to understand. ,Past boyfriends would act aggressive saying; 'if you hurt yourself, I’ll do it to myself too' or 'I'm trying to make you better, you're not helping yourself'. These words of anger were not the way to handle things. I don't know if it was anger towards me, towards the illness or just because they didn't understand. Nobody wants to see someone they care about ill. I can understand the anger but it was not the reaction I craved. ,It's always difficult ,. Being at university and coming out about my depression and , and admitting I was ill was one of the hardest things I've done to date. My flatmates understand but at the same time they don't. My boyfriend understands but at the same time he doesn't. It's difficult talking about it because how are people going to react? Will they judge you or will they understand?,Maybe if I spoke about this when I was 15, then I wouldn’t have struggled so much. If I had spoken about how I was feeling then maybe I wouldn’t have relapsed with self-harm so many times. Maybe I wouldn’t now be on anti-depressants and waiting for counselling. Maybe I would be a completely different person. But I didn’t talk about my mental health. I thought of it just as much of a taboo subject as everyone else did and I thought it was my problem that I had to face on my own.,Five years later that is not the case at all. It is okay to talk about things and it’s okay to admit when you need someone to just listen. I've found that more people discuss their mental health so openly and it is the most refreshing thing to see. It is healthy. It needs to be done. ,Mental health isn't a taboo subject. It's the demon many people fight with every day. It's something that needs so much more attention, care and time. It is something that needs to be spoken about and it needs to be spoken about now."
"Ashley, ","I first met Ron 10 years ago, when we were both hospitalized on a psychiatric ward. It was my first hospitalization for ,, whereas he had , and had been hospitalized multiple times before. We connected instantly, despite the strong disapproval of the hospital staff, and formed an intense bond that would last for years. I felt like my illness had caused me to lose who I was, but somehow Ron was able to see through the illness to the real me underneath. In turn, that helped me begin to find myself again. He accepted me completely and unconditionally, and at the time it felt like he was the only person who wasn’t judging me.,
Mental illness sometimes limited what we were comfortable with, so we adapted to each other’s needs. Being around other people sometimes made me feel overwhelmed or him feel paranoid, so instead we took pleasure in cooking elaborate meals at home or going for quiet summer picnics. There was no way illness was going to stop us from enjoying our time together.,
As the years passed, we both had periods of really struggling with our illnesses. It wasn’t easy, but being there for each other was never a question, it was just a given. When I became depressed again, he did everything he could to help boost me up. When he , and ended up in a coma in the intensive care unit (ICU), I was at his bedside as many hours each day as I possibly could. When he was discharged from hospital and became suicidal again, I hauled him back to emergency and advocated for him to be admitted. All of this was hard - really, really hard - but I knew he would do the same for me. I believe that love means always being in the other ,, because there is just nowhere else that I would want to be.,
That’s not to say there wasn’t judgement around our relationship; that’s where stigma reared its ugly head. I was the health professional with a successful career earning a good income, whereas Ron’s life was significantly impacted by his chronic schizophrenia and further complicated by substance abuse. I found it extremely hurtful when people didn’t approve that I was with someone who “wasn’t good enough”, but in the end those stigmatizing attitudes said a lot more about the people who held them, than they did about me and Ron.,
Ron passed away unexpectedly two years ago, a victim of the opioid crisis. I learned so much from him, including a lot about myself. I learned that mental illness doesn’t make me or anyone else less worthy of being loved. I learned that being in each other’s corner can truly be an all-in proposition, and mental illness doesn’t have to detract from that. I learned that love can allow you to see past mental illness to the light glowing within.,
Loving someone with a mental illness can be hard work, but being there through thick and thin for someone you love can be rewarding beyond measure. And those of us with mental illness are no less deserving of that than anyone else.,Read Ashley's blog , "
"Andrew, ","I’m unsure I’ve ever been described as an ‘inspiration’, until now. Should it even matter?,I think it does because words – carefully-chosen or not – can shape attitudes. How often have we watched, or read about, a Paralympian’s medal-winning success and the adjective ‘inspirational’ has been used? It’s meant as a sincere compliment, and yet an unintended consequence may be to reinforce what makes them different.,The same could apply to mental health, particularly if it’s framed as an illness one ‘admits’ to having. “Ultimately, we need to get to a point where a big announcement or confession isn’t needed, but for now I feel a sense of relief for you that you’ve overcome that hurdle,” said a close mate of mine. He is gay, and related entirely to living with a secret that can seem burdensome.,When I described for the first time my own experience of managing ,, and living with ,, I was pensive about how people would react. It was something I couldn’t control, and sharing the fact I was vulnerable led to me believing I would be more so once others found out.,My ,, certainly the ones I love most, occupied my thoughts most of all. So, I asked them what sensations they remember while reading my first blog for Time to Change, in which I attempted to explain why I’d been inspired to volunteer for a campaign that focuses on challenging stigma surrounding mental health.,One by one, my phone lit up with their responses. “I think people will be inspired by your words,” read the first text that arrived. Meanwhile the second said: “I’m proud you made a brave decision to put your issues out there.” A pattern was forming by the time a third followed. It added: “I found inspiration from the fact you’d taken a step to go public with something so personal.” And that’s uplifting, at least initially.,I was frightened, and still am, that they’d change the way they act towards me or begin to censor the things they say. But which bit is inspirational? Perhaps they perceive me to be better now and to have left behind a former, less well, version of myself. Maybe it’s because I seem to balance what I do, be that personally or professionally, despite having a mental illness.,I’m certain it’s uninspiring for others to discover I’ve risen from my bed in the morning, yet occasionally for me that’s a momentous achievement. I don’t know if it’s brave to leave my apartment, particularly when every fibre of my body is willing against it, and go to work. And yet when I make it there, at my lowest ebb, I’ve recorded a significant victory.,That is not to say that people’s kindness, and their attempt to comfort me, isn’t appreciated. I insist; it really is. But to share how my mental health affects my daily life, and in turn exposing that to a wider audience, carried a risk. I don’t regret taking it though.,“To read your sentiments showed bravery to challenge yourself,” was another of the messages I received this week. “It was remarkable to observe you take it on.”,I don’t write about how depression feels to be considered courageous, rather to reach out to those having – or have had – a similar experience. Another motivation is to encourage empathy, or at least a richer understanding, among others that haven’t.,When reflecting on people’s reactions, I wonder if that’s been a blind-spot. That’s why I looked again at my friends’ replies. “Reading your words made me feel like you said; it’s ok not to be ok,” wrote one. “And so, I sent a link to a friend I knew had struggled because I thought it would help him. And it did.”,Studying once more that third message was illuminating as well. It concluded: “You described your own disguise and it made me want to drop mine and not keep things hidden behind it.”,And there it is; that’s what inspires me to ,."
"Mary, ","‘You’re not really ,though are you?’,This was what my colleague said to me, while I was explaining why I had to go home early from work that day. I had just finished crying and felt tired, overwhelmed and exhausted. I felt short of breath and panicky; what I imagine a mild heart attack might feel like. Guess I wasn’t explaining this clearly enough to him.,I thought dealing with , in , was hard enough but as a ‘young working professional’ it has been twice as difficult. For me, I think it has been really difficult because my anxiety mainly stems from wanting to have control over situations and what I do. At school and university, this was hard but ultimately, I think being anxious about my grades and wanting to please my , led to me driving myself forward. I constantly pushed myself and internalised my worrying because the achievements were really just ‘my own concern’. I wanted to be the best I could be, which resulted in me getting good grades and receiving an unconditional offer from my first-choice university. Woo! This was great, but also problematic, to base my feeling of success and probably worth on academic grades. This is a whole other problem which I wrote about in another post ,.,At ,, I think my anxiety has gotten worse because in the workplace you need to be interdependent on others to produce your ‘output’. So I guess you can control less. As a management consultant, my work is project based and requires working in teams with people at my firm and with clients. Unlike at university, when how hard I worked was generally positively correlated with achievements, in the workplace you are dependent on other people for things to happen.,This post is therefore about Millennials living with generalised anxiety. If you’re not already aware of what a millennial is, it’s the generation of children born between 1982 and 2002. Generalised anxiety is worrying consistently about a wide range of situations and issues. Below I go into what it is, how it affects me and what might make anxiety worse.,To me, anxiety feels like trying to maintain control but feeling like you really can’t.,I feel like I’m in one of those game shows, with those money machines and trying to catch and be in control of things (the money flying about) in my life but I can’t.,At the same time, anxiety is about fear and uncertainty about the future. So, in this money machine analogy, you don’t know at what intensity/frequency the money will be flowing - and that is stressful., I have heard people go as far as saying that millennials are an anxious generation. This could be due to technology, which means increased interconnectedness and consciousness about what other people spend their time doing. Also, this ‘hustle hard’ mentality; the idea we need to have a full-time job, side hustle, stable social life and look and dress to the point, all the time, to be a ‘successful’ millennial. That feeling your life needs to be ,. Whatever that means. To me, millennial anxiety is worth singling out because I think anxiety and , are more common, now than ever, with young people.,Millennials, unfortunately, have many reasons to be anxious; large student debts, ,, finding a job you actually enjoy and that won’t mean that you will be replaced by a robot, looking for somewhere to live and generally just thinking about the direction you want to take your life in. Plus, finding funds and time to do other , things like go on holiday and relax with friends., definitely plays a big role in this.,I love social media but I really think that it exacerbates my anxiety and leads to me overthinking, comparing myself to others and thinking about how ‘likeable’ I am.,Imagine this.,You are scrolling down your Instagram feed.,The first picture you see is a friend having a delicious lunch in Mykonos. The next is another friend’s picture from last night out with her colleagues. , You get fed up and switch to Instagram stories. You click on the first story and this is one of your friends in the gym at 5.30am. , This is all while you are in your PJs, next to a bag of crisps with a Netflix favourite on pause, remembering that your last post only had 32 likes by day three and many of those were family members, who like every one of your posts.,I think we can all relate to this situation, in one way or another. If you can’t, this feeling is a type of anxiety. You are comparing your circumstance right now to your friends’ highlights.,Therefore, I believe it is so important to take social media breaks and actively recognise that social media is a highlight reel of people’s lives, where they rarely show the less glamorous bits.,I truly do believe that there is no health without mental health, so try and take care of yourself! ,Thanks for reading - this was difficult for me to write. ,

"Maria, ","I was first diagnosed with clinical depression at the age of 16. Since then, I’ve gone through really low patches every few years. For me, , feels like losing the will to live. I stop caring about everything and anyone, especially myself. Even getting out of bed becomes an insurmountable obstacle, so I just don't even try.,I used to find talking about my feelings basically impossible, so even though I needed help, and was at times ,, it was incredibly difficult for me to communicate any of this to the people around me. If anyone asked how I was – ,, my GP – I’d just say “I’m fine!”. I’m a real expert when it comes to fake bubbliness. Instead of speaking about my pain, I'd take it out on myself, by not eating, for example.,...denying my depression, rather than accepting it, had been making things a whole lot worse.,I hoped that my mental health would naturally improve with age. In fact, I was counting on it. When I had a nervous breakdown at the age of 30, and was unable to leave my house, I realised that denying my depression, rather than accepting it, had been making things a whole lot worse. If my depression wasn't going to go away for good, then it was about time I befriended it. I decided to stop lying.,This year, I suffered another episode. Instead of hiding away and covering up what’s going on with me, I went to the GP. He put me on medication and referred me to a (surprisingly unscary!) psychiatrist, who signed me off work. I decided to be honest with my employers too. To my surprise, I received a card from my line manager and colleagues. In it was a list of “Ten Things We Could Do to Help (Unless It’s Annoying)”. They outlined ten treats for me to choose from – from a homemade cake or a handwritten story, to a foot massage or a cup of tea and a walk – with the option to choose them all, if I so desired. I was bowled over! I could never have expected such kindness, understanding, and good will. Acceptance is the most incredible gift to receive.,When my neighbours noticed that I was staying at home all day and asked if I was okay, I decided to tell them the truth. They have been amazing – whenever I’m having a bad day I now know that I’m welcome to go round to theirs for a cup of tea and a chat.,When someone reacts in a really kind, normalising, accepting way, I know they're worth keeping in my life.,I still struggle , with everyone, and I often feel judged when I talk about my mental health, even within my own family. But since I have made steps towards talking more openly about my illness, the less fearful and ashamed I feel. When someone reacts in a really kind, normalising, accepting way, I know they're worth keeping in my life.,Speaking out feels like taking back control, taking back my right to speak. I just wish I’d started doing this sooner."
"Emma and Sophie, ","We are Emma and Sophie and two years ago we bumped into each other while we were out for dinner. We had been really good , in the past but had fallen out of touch over the last few years. We had never meant to lose touch but we had both been scared that too much time had gone by to reconnect.,Unknown to us, so much had happened since we last saw each other. The main thing that we discovered was that we had both been through a lot of , that had affected our mental health. As anyone who has suffered from mental health difficulties, such as , or , knows, these can make it very hard to keep up with friendships and relationships. Depression can tell us that we are not worthy of someone else’s company. Anxiety can make it impossible to leave the house.,After we bumped into each other, we agreed to meet up for a catch up, and wow was there a lot to catch up on! We talked about hospitals, mental, as well as physical illness, grief and lots more. But that first , was life changing for both of us. We understood what it was like to have been through some big life stuff and listened to each other without judgment. ,We didn’t have this conversation to be ‘dramatic’, or to ‘make a scene’. We were talking because ,. What we didn’t realise is that not everyone is as well versed as we are in having this conversation, in checking in with how someone is really doing. The people at the table next to us were leaning in listening to our conversation in horror and fascination! They seemed scared of hearing people talking about loss, trauma and mental illness openly. They didn’t even pretend not to be listening. We knew because we could see the looks on their faces and their thinly disguised whispers to each other. At first I did think I was imagining it but I asked Emma and she noticed it too! ,Since that first day, we have met up regularly over tea and cake. Every time we have discussed our mental health we have experienced this same reaction, so much so that we were starting to wonder if we should say something, to ask what the people next to us were thinking. The last time we met was slightly different though. This time we overheard a conversation about a friend who was apparently not acting the way someone with depression and anxiety should act. Emma was getting quite triggered about this conversation and was wondering whether she should actually say something to them, in order to educate their ,. She didn’t in the end, but they could see that we were dithering on our way out, hopefully wondering what it was they might have said. ,Should we have said anything to any of these strangers at the next table? We don’t know. But do you know what? Neither of us would have minded if even one of them leant over and asked what we were talking about, instead of so obviously listening in. Neither of us is ashamed of our experiences and we would have welcomed the opportunity to help someone to consider their conceptions of mental illness. What would you do?,We have since decided that despite the interest, or perhaps because of it, our talks have been so therapeutic that we are now using our experiences to tackle the stigma surrounding mental health issues. We set about working on an idea which combines mental health and fashion, by creating clothing and accessories, with a positive message about mental health. Our aim is to start these difficult conversations and make it OK to talk. This has been hugely successful through our market stall, where we listen and share mental health stories, really opening the conversation with people from all ages and backgrounds.   ,This has shown us that using our skills and personal experiences are the best way to help address the stigma surrounding mental health. After all, fashion is for everyone, just like mental health. "
"Penny, ","There is a secret; one that nobody is prepared to talk about; one so shocking it may bring down society as we know it. Am I talking about a scandal, or some sort of political corruption? Am I talking about some secret society that quietly rules over us, or perhaps I am talking about the fact we are all lizard people. While I would infinitely prefer to talk about any one of these things, I am in fact talking about the truth that, literally, nobody is talking about. I am talking about the fact that people with mental illness walk among us.,I hear your gasps and sighs; “not this again,” “haven’t we already talked about this?” and trust me I hear you. In essence you are right; people with mental illness are no longer labelled as “crazy” or “psychos” and that’s great, it really is, but the sad truth is, we’re not being talked about as real people either. We are not seen as human beings, who happen to have various conditions, but we are in fact seen as the embodiment of the conditions themselves. I suffer with , and yet many people feel obliged to tell me that I “am” bipolar. How would you feel if I said that you “were” varicose veins, or you “were” diabetes?,The fact is that people with mental illness are not often talked about badly anymore, it seems we are just, quite simply, not talked about, not in any meaningful way anyway. I see people putting up posts on my Facebook all the time, with one off little comments on how they’ve struggled, and that’s great - more power to them, but these are just fleeting moments of support, that quickly fizzle and burn out. There is no substance to them.,More and more people are talking to their , about mental illness, which is amazing, but let’s be honest, would you tell your work , or your footy ,?,Then there are the types of illnesses that we talk about. While we are all greatly aware that there are people with , or , out there, it appears that illnesses like , i.e. , and , are to be exempt from this feeling of understanding and tolerance. It shocks me, that even in 2018, the only time I read about these types of illnesses are either in , or articles about violence and murder. Many celebrities are willing to come forward in support of anxiety and depression, but only a handful will come forward to support “unpopular” illnesses.,And that’s another point, do celebrity endorsements really help? While it gets the word out there and spreads the message of tolerance, it also makes mental illness seem a far-off thing, only to be worried about by the rich and famous who don’t really walk among us. Well, they do.,Then there are the prejudices of mental health services themselves. Having suffered with an eating disorder, I can tell you that it isn’t all about weight. Yet eating disorder services have to give out resources on, guess what, weight criteria, leaving anyone who isn’t severely underweight feeling lost and abandoned.,I’m not saying that we’re not , at all. Some people with mental illness are proactive in getting the word out there, but many are afraid to, out of fear and stigma. Maybe if we talked more, we would find that people are more tolerant than we think. This is not supposed to be a rant at people, it is merely supposed to be a message that what we say is important and can make a huge difference.,People are more than happy to talk about their “success” in recovery, but very few will talk about the constant risk of relapse, or their bad days. This gives the wrong message that mental illness is something to be “overcome”, rather than lived with. There is a lot out there in the world, a lot of noise, but I wonder if we cut through the politics and the media hype, we may find that just talking might help.,People with mental illness are , they are here with us. They are our doctors, our friends, our mothers and firefighters, they are our partners, or siblings, our teachers, and they are allowed to have bad days.,So, next time you are out at the pub, or about to make a Facebook post, next time you go shopping with your friend or you stop for a five-minute chat in your lunch break, just remember this piece and maybe try to talk about it. You never know, you might just be surprised."
,"I grew up in a , where we didn't talk about mental health so all the issues I was dealing with were swept under the rug. I was always told to pray about it because prayer solved everything and I knew/felt that wasn't true. I wanted to talk about it and find out why I felt the way I did or why I hurt myself, physically and mentally, the way I did, but no one in my family wanted to help me with that.,Fast forward to getting married too young and my ex-husband joined the military causing us to move thousands of miles away from everything I'd known for the last 21 years. To cope, I first started by drinking all the time and continuing to ignore like I had been taught all my years living at home. I eventually couldn't cope because it got harder and harder to get out of bed in the morning and be a functioning normal person. It still didn't seem like enough because I still didn't have support or someone to talk to that understood what was wrong and why I felt the way I did.,Medications just numbed me and made me feel like a shell of a person and I went with it because it helped me at least function, but I still continued to drink. When we were moved to Germany I added pot to my life and it made my problems disappear even more, so in a sense they were still being swept under the rug.,My ex-husband and I decided to take time apart from each other, but before the military allowed us to do that we had to go to counselling. It was the first time I became aware of the fact there were people out there who had jobs that revolved around talking to people and helping them, and I was in my mid-twenties. It was insane to realise that I could have gone to , years ago to help me sort out my problems.,Once I was finally sent home from Germany to my hometown I fell into my old pattern of life. I spent an entire summer drunk every day and basically not dealing with anything because I was back living with my parents and I felt like I was in high school again. I knew I had problems and they should be dealt with, but the ‘prayers is the answer’ was shoved in my face again. I eventually dived into the counselling thing again and it took me a while to find a counsellor I trusted and seemed to help me, but everything was focused on my pending divorce and dealing with those feelings and issues.,Now that I am in my thirties, I am finally at a point where I know I have mental health issues and have found a wonderful therapist who is helping me with that. I've learned what has been troubling me for so much of my life that no one was every willing to address. I look forward to my sessions with her and delving more into things that no one has ever told me I had that were why I felt like life was so difficult.,It is weird to hear words like , and , or that I have been living with a sleep disorder for years. To finally feel like I am on a path to figuring my life out and have a wonderful support group in my husband, therapist, and friends who struggle like I do. It's great to know there are ways to feel better and know you are not alone.,Due to all the years I spent sweeping things under the rug, because that's what my family taught me is the right thing to do, I tell people what I'm dealing with and am transparent about it.,I don't drink and I tell people why. I have bad days where I don't want to be touched, looked at, or anything, so I tell people why. I don't want anyone to wonder why about me, so I tell them because it is nothing to be ashamed of.,Mental health should not be something we should be ashamed of and talking about it to anyone is a great way to heal. It may in turn help people who don't deal with it to understand those who do and not treat them like they are wrong. Never sweep your mental health under a rug. Tell people about it and find support because in the end it will make you feel stronger and better.,There are so many bad things going on in this world that we need to be loving and lifting each other up. One way to do that is to understand things you don't struggle with. Be supportive of people with struggle and ask them about it instead of putting them down. Love them instead of harming them more. You could be the one to make their day better."
"Rachael, ","When I’m really struggling internally, I overcompensate externally. Think Ross from Friends when he finds out about Rachel and Joey. That episode struck a chord with me because I’ve lost count of the times when I’ve tried to put on a good show and ended up looking like an absolute idiot. I’d get all loud and animated; try to be funny; try to convince others and myself that there’s nothing wrong. They say the unhappiest people are the ones that seem the happiest. For a large chunk of my school days, that was me. My face was laughing and smiling but my eyes weren’t. In my adult life, pretending got harder until I just couldn’t any more.,Why did I feel like I had to put on that front? Originally it was because I just wasn’t even acknowledging to myself that I had a problem. These days it’s more fear of how people would respond if I displayed my true emotions. Some people don’t “believe” in ,. I don’t know how, because it’s everywhere. The word “depressed” is flung around flippantly by people who are just upset about something or having a bad day. Maybe that’s where the apathy comes from. People who claim to be depressed trivialise the condition for those whose lives are genuinely blighted by it.,There are unwritten rules for answering certain questions. When people ask: “how are you?” they expect to get the statutory “I’m fine thanks, how are you?” Not: “I feel like I’m falling apart and I can’t cope,” or “I don’t know how I’ll get through the day,” or some other variation of the hellish truth. That makes for a rubbish situation where, even when you get texts or actual face-to-face enquiries into your wellbeing, you skirt around it or make something up or dismiss it.,“What have they got to be depressed about?”,I’ve dedicated the other half of this post to tackling some of the things I’ve heard people say relating to depression. This one usually rears its head when there’s a celebrity involved. Take , for example. Known for his seemingly happy-go-lucky nature and vivacious sense of humour. Clearly his smile was hiding a world of pain. But he’s rich, he’s famous, he’s successful. What’s he got to be depressed about? We’ll never know the answer to that, but we need to stop asking the question. Or rather, we need to stop asking it in such a dismissive way. When the news broke about Aaron Lennon, it was immediately followed by references to his income and status as a Premier League footballer. Yes, there are people who have it worse economically and people who have had horrible, harrowing things happen to them throughout their lives and just “got on with it” but why use that as a stick to beat someone who is already at rock bottom? They will be well aware of all that. Everything you’re saying and thinking, they will have said to themselves ten times over. So then there’s the feeling of guilt thrown into the mix; the sense that they have no right to feel the way they do. That just compounds the issue.,“Don’t be so sensitive”,Depression’s not about sensitivity. Some of the strongest, toughest, take-no-prisoners- type of people suffer with depression. I know because I know them. There needs to be more openness and understanding surrounding mental health and well-being. But we don’t all need to be holding hands and showering each other with compliments and treading on eggshells, scared to say or do anything that may be misconstrued in some way. Far from it. When someone is in the pits of despair, the best thing you can do is just be there for them. In the most normal way possible. You don’t have to do anything spectacular or extraordinary. You don’t have to change your behaviour or your personality or the way you interact with them. You haven’t got a magic wand. You can’t fix their problems. But just being there can make all the difference. Sometimes, when wandering the corridors at work, perpetual cloud hanging ominously overhead, the sight of a friendly face coming towards me was enough to make me a bit better. If honest surveys were taken in the ,, there would probably be a surprising number of people who are experiencing depression or ,, or have experienced it at some point in their lives. Everyone’s fighting their own battles. It would be so much easier if people could join forces.,“It’s attention seeking”,This one is dangerous, because if someone at rock bottom hears this about themselves, after they’ve plucked up the courage to disclose what they’re going through, it can send them spiralling into further isolation and their thought patterns spiralling down life-threatening avenues. When I hear the phrase “attention-seeking” used in relation to depression, it makes me laugh and makes me angry in equal parts. Do people really think I’ve devised this little world of hell for myself and decided to live in it just for the fun of it? That I choose to be a misery who can’t see the point in anything anymore? That I consciously throw away people and things and opportunities that mean a great deal to me because I just love to make life hard for myself? The isolation, the hopelessness, the despair, the panic, the dread, the turmoil, the cacophony of emotions – all of them negative – crushing my spirit day in day out. Love all that, me."
,"I’m James, I’m 25 years old, and I live in a small town just outside of Chester. I’m a Time to Change Young Champion, and that means I spend my spare time campaigning to stamp out stigma and discrimination around mental health in the UK. I became a Young Champion towards the end of last year in the midst of my struggles with my own mental health – I have struggled with , for as long as I can remember and I have been battling , for around seven years. I was also diagnosed with ADHD and dyslexia over the last few years, which I have been learning to manage better each day.,My battles with mental health problems and disability have caused me much upheaval. It’s affected every aspect of my life, from my confidence to my career and beyond. I’ve faced ,, in environments like the doctor's office when I’ve been trying to get help or the interview room when I’ve been trying to get a ,. Being on the receiving end of stigma or discrimination, be it intentional or not, can cause such self-doubt and make you feel like a liar, a fraud, or just broken. People often have ideas of the way people with mental health problems may appear or act, but they are often inaccurate perceptions. ,In response, I decided to start campaigning to change attitudes towards mental health. I do this in many ways: sometimes it’s by sharing information through social media or writing a blog, other times it’s organising a local event or helping with someone else's event in another part of the country. It is very satisfying to see real time change in people’s attitudes and reactions to mental health, and I believe that knowledge plays a vital role in people's understanding of mental health and how it can impact people close to them.,I have been lucky to have many conversations over the last year, with friends, members of the public and fellow young champions. The most inspiring chat was with a concerned teacher, they had an infectious passion for ensuring that they were doing everything they could to help their pupils as well as their own children. It was really reassuring to know that the vast majority of teachers do care and want to help their students to be mentally well and succeed, something which I previously doubted due to my own experiences ,.,I love getting the opportunity to speak to people from all walks of life, young and old, through campaigning about mental health – it highlights that everyone has a story. If someone isn’t affected directly by a mental health problem, they often know someone who does, and providing them with information from Time to Change can help spark , that can improve awareness and even save lives. It’s as important as ever to be talking about mental health and stamping out stigma and discrimination, and connecting with people is a huge part of that."
,"So...when did my , kick in? How am I supposed to know? Therein lies some of the problem. I was there but I wasn’t...confusing? It was for me and no less painful.,Looking back, my , recall me disappearing from nights out - I recall at that time feeling lonely and empty. I left my job after 18 years in 2007 because I felt hollow and in such a dark place. I would often be curled up in a ball in my bedroom. Depression? No idea! What was clear now (but not over the years) was the dark and hollow feeling inside was growing and eating away. I have a wonderful group of friends – many from school days - yet when planning to go out with them, I’d feel so scared, sad and so desperate. Thankfully my friends were understanding but did they think I was showing signs of depression? No.,Having left my previous ,, I wanted a role that brought me closer to home. Travelling and being away from family brought anxiety. I took up a role in the community. Initially this seemed to work and bring me some balance. However, the darkness soon began to grow at pace.,For many who know me, they see the Lee who is “bubbly” and often the “life and soul of the party”. No way is he depressed.,Looking back now, that made the suffering even more painful. But did I know what was happening? No.,The community work was great when I was using my “charisma” and “personality” to make a real difference to people’s lives. Without knowing, it possibly acted as my escape; my medicine. However Public Sector was changing dramatically and horribly. Increasingly run by people who were so detached from the ‘real’ world, they believed ticking boxes and justifying existence was all that was needed. Box ticked, people helped: wrong. The battle I was having with the ethics of a huge organisation was dragging me further into the darkness. Surely this was not the right way to work. It wasn’t really helping people – ironically it wasn’t helping me.,The support? Regular 1:1’s in a format that, you guessed it, ticked the boxes. Devised by people who lived in a different world and believed the company came first: box ticked. When leaders asked how I was, did they listen to the answer? Sadly not. I was once given a number to call: box ticked. I was then given an occupational therapist appointment for another condition which was, frankly, useless. During the session, (where they turned up half an hour late), I tried to ,, but no that wasn’t what the appointment was for.,I was now an entirely differently person. I’d always cared, particularly about doing the right thing and doing a good job. However I was now too regularly in that dark place inside. Did I have depression? No idea? I was making personal and work mistakes. Did I care? No. Ultimately one of those mistakes brought me up against my employer. The wall was hit. It was like travelling at speed knowing the barrier was coming but not knowing when I’d crash. I crashed.,Was I understood? No.,I had to take on the full might of the organisation; “Diagnosed with depression!? But you couldn’t have had depression before that – you did a wonderful presentation”.,Let me put it like this for you: the doctor has only just diagnosed you with depression. When a footballer breaks his leg on a football pitch, is rushed to hospital, x-rayed and then the doctor tells him he has a broken leg...when did he break his leg? I recall a manager asking during a break for one of the ‘battle’ meetings; “Are you OK?” I replied no. ,. I’d also heard that you get sacked for what you do, not what you don’t do. So if you shuffle the issues of mental illness and stresses of colleagues, you’ll always be safe.,So, my recovery. My wife loved me but most importantly knew me - something others in the workplace had chosen to ignore. My , were there for me - in many ways they were not surprised. I will be forever thankful for their belief and support.,I wonder whether those that , understand what it is like to contemplate ,; what it is like to know your children follow you to check you don’t do anything stupid. I had depression but I didn’t know what that meant. I had a wonderful GP who understood. She arranged counselling and medication. As a result, I discovered what I should have known; I was actually a very good human being with an illness, something that didn’t come out in the workplace.,I am now very open about my depression. I now work in the charity environment (unfortunately still witnessing a lack of understanding in the workplace) where I am fortunate to communicate with many people and share my experience with depression through training sessions. After all that time, I now know I have depression. I am aware when a depression episode is upon me – I can ride the storm but the storm is still there. But knowing is a much better position; I can share with family, friends and colleagues.,So there are more than likely many out there in a similar position to me. For the first time, the human race and society have fallen behind with the ability to cope with modern life and pressure. We must learn to put people and colleagues before corporate logos and reputations; otherwise this painful and hidden disease will become an epidemic (if it isn’t one already)."
,"“I WOULD never have suspected.”,Those five words are innocuous in that short sentence, but their impact on me was bigger.,
I had spoken previously to a handful of people before then about my experience of living with ,, and managing , too. But it’s only when somebody comments on a disguise, that you realise how effective it has been. I hadn’t consciously put one on, rather grown into it. There is, not now or ever, any intention to deceive on my part, but concealment seemed the comfiest fit – the best way to get through next day.,
That’s as far ahead as I look.,
As for the five words, it’s what my , said next that struck a chord; “That’s what prompted me to go get help and advice,” she added. This is somebody I know well and knowing that I’d been through a tough and challenging time – a person they believe successfully projects a version of themselves to the outside world that portrays something different – had become a spur for them to act.,
That’s powerful.,
It surprised me too, but in a wholly transformative way. I had never given much thought to how sharing that side of me with anybody would be received. After all, the prospect of doing so felt scary and out of my control. I volunteered to become a , earlier this year, and that exchange with a friend was a catalyst.,
As I’ve started to , about what I’m going through – whether it’s a comment here or a social media post there – the response I have continues to inspire me. My phone has lit up more than once with a text offering words of support. Others have sent me a message privately online. Not once have I felt pressure to confess anything but I have felt comfort, relief too, from knowing there are ,
That’s not to say I doubted as much, but the fact they reaffirm it is so heartening. But those same words – ‘I would never have guessed’ – have been repeated over and over.,
And they resonate.,
I don’t know if they’re genuinely surprised, or maybe don’t know what else to say. If they had recognised signs, wouldn’t they have said something? How many others around us, who we talk to daily, are wearing a similar disguise to the one I have? That’s why I signed up to be a Champion.,
I’m not sure I’ve ever felt ashamed, but I’ve certainly been careful about what I’ve written or said. That’s been a survival mechanism, and it works. I don’t want it to be that way though. For those that don’t know, Time to Change invites supporters to sign a pledge wall, promising to play their part in helping to end mental health ,. It’s one of the first things I did, and my promise reads: ""As somebody who has needed - and richly benefited from - support and understanding to handle my own emotional and psychological challenges previously, I pledge to use that empathy and experience to raise awareness, confront stigma and help inspire a change in attitudes towards mental health issues."",I’ve no idea if that’s too ambitious, but as a journalist my reserves of perseverance are plentiful! I’ll stick at it. This isn’t a personal quest to get others, whether I know them or not, to go and get help. Nor am I seeking sympathy.,
I can’t diagnose a mental health issue somebody else has although I probably am able to recognise some of the signs. Depression made me insular, inadvertently selfish, and in some ways counter-intuitive to talk or write openly about how it feels. But the potential benefits of doing so, be that convincing others to change how they engage with mental health issues or directly challenging ,, make the effort worthwhile.,
To finish, I’ll share a secret:,
I carry with me everywhere a folded piece of blue paper, on which I’ve scribbled a collection of handwritten notes and words. They include advice, addressed to myself, that I wrote during a moment of reflection after visiting a museum exhibition in London on the history of mental illness, asylums and people’s attitudes towards both in the UK.,
‘What support might you need if you were struggling with your mental health?’ is one of the questions I answered. I won’t share all of what I’ve scrawled, save for a single word: ‘reassurance.’,
Why that one? Because even the guy that you’d never suspect can benefit from a reminder that it’s perfectly ok to struggle."
,"When I reflect on the past eight months, I look back at what has been a successful time in my life; but one that has been struck with ,.,In April this year, I was diagnosed with depression and ,. I'd been battling with symptoms for a long time and while I think I know the trigger, (a situation which occurred in January), I recognise that anxiety and depression can happen to any of us and I therefore do not feel this event alone directly lead to my mental illness. As expected, this situation knocked my confidence and I spent days on end locked in my room at ,, constantly crying, feeling hopeless, emotional and severely low. This was such a pivotal stage in my university career and I began to grow even more anxious through fear of falling behind.,Thankfully this was not the case and I'm so grateful to two of my closest university ,, who supported me through some of the darkest and toughest days. They were my biggest support and they often reassured me that things would get better. In fact, they were the ones who persuaded me to go to the doctors in order to discuss my feelings and emotions. My uni friends were definitely , and they provided me with constant guidance, ensuring that I always had a shoulder to cry on. I was always able to , to them without feeling judged.,I never really understood mental health until I was diagnosed with it. I always showed sympathy towards my friends who were sufferers of mental illness, but never empathy. I was unable to fully and wholly understand their perspective, as I had never experienced it before. However, this changed following my diagnosis. I gained some sort of an understanding of how they were feeling, because I was going through similar feelings myself.,It is important for us all to recognise that mental illness can happen to any of us. In fact, it affects 1 in 4 of us throughout our lifetimes. This is why it is so important to understand it and support those who are suffering. Though I've battled with depression and anxiety for the past eight months, I was able to graduate with a first class degree and secure a job, which I absolutely love. I'm thankful for the continued support I've received and continue to receive. ,Needless to say, a lot of people see the outer me, the shell of me, the one that wants to always be happy. While I am doing well for myself; some days continue to be extremely difficult. There are days I feel I can't face the world, days I spend locked in my room and days I don't even want to speak to my nearest and dearest.,Understandably, this has deeply affected my ,. Mental health is still a , within the African Caribbean community but I'm thankful for a family who now understand my condition. Slowly, I've been able to break down the , attached to mental health within my family and I only hope this attitude can spread to others.,It was initially difficult for my family to come to terms with this news, especially my mum who still gets really upset whenever I feel low and experience a bout of depression. I've also witnessed my brother in tears, following a situation where I felt so low I was taken to hospital. This, more than anything, really hit home. It made me see the true effect that mental health can have on families.,As a successful young woman who prides herself on being happy and positive, there was a sense of shock when my family and close friends found out. I received comments such as 'wow you would have never guessed you'd have it'. Once again, this is why it is so important to recognise that mental health can happen to any of us. You never really know what someone is going through, so never judge someone by their outward appearance.,I take each day as it comes and strive to overcome every battle I'm faced with. Mental health will not defeat me. It will not defeat you. It will not defeat any of us.,""Life is a blessing. Live it"""
,"I first properly experienced mental health issues at the age of 15 was when, and with this came a lot of damaging attitudes and actions. When I started going to therapy for treatment of depression and anxiety, I was still at school and my peers told me that ‘I didn’t look like a psycho’, which is kind of a backwards compliment that made me feel I had to be sicker.,Then, later on in my life when I was 19/20, I was diagnosed with a , and an ,. People told me I wasn’t ‘thin enough’ for an eating disorder. This made me want to control my eating more and made me reject a diagnosis that took me so long to get in the first place, which in turn led me to not get the treatment I needed.,The stories above are part of the reason why I started campaigning as a Time to Change Young Champion. I wanted to change these attitudes that people had towards me, so that no one had to feel the way that I did. It was also important to me as I knew that I myself had played a part of causing some stigma, due to the way I was brought up.,It was ingrained into me from a young age that depression didn’t really exist, and if it did it was only adults who had a bad life who got it. And it was a weakness if they did had it.,These misconceptions had an effect on me when I was suffering as they prevented me from getting help. It made me realise that I needed to do something to stop others from thinking and feeling the same way, and that's why I started campaigning with Time to Change.,I love campaigning with Time to Change and have so many great stories about my experiences already. However, I’m just going to share one.,I had just finished my first year of University and had decided to do some work experience in a school. This , is where one of my old teachers now works – he helped me a lot in the past when I was really struggling. He knew about my work with Time to Change and asked if I could do something with two of his classes.,So I decided to read them my testimony. These children were around 11 years old, so in my head they were quite young, but the teacher assured me they’d be fine.,I walked into a loud classroom, of busy children, and thought ‘there is no way they are going to care or want to listen’. I was introduced and one of the boys made some sort of joke about ‘oh is this going to be serious stuff’.,I then started talking, and the room fell silent. Everybody was listening to me, and even when I had stopped, the room was silent. They were then invited to ask questions, or which there were many, but I was willing to answer them all.,I was at that school for four weeks, and I did this on my first. For the next four weeks I had these children come up to me and tell me how brave I was, I had some come and see me every break time to help plan their own campaign focusing on happiness.,Not were the young people approaching me, but I also had their tutors telling me how much of an impact I’d had on them. One day the deputy head said he had received an email from a parent, and I initially panicked, but it was saying how grateful she was that I had spoken to her child and that I had made her child feel less alone. One parent even come up to me and hugged me in tears in the playground because of how glad she was that I had spoken to her child.,Even though, at times, this campaigning can feel hard work, it is always so worth it for the impact it has on people. I’m so glad I’m a part of it."
,"As a man with mental health problems myself, when the topic of men’s mental health comes up I often feel guilty. There are so many women suffering not just from mental health problems but also from a wide range of societal problems that can make it harder to cope with them. Who are we as men to complain about the stigma we face? But the more I think about it the more I realise that the guilt I feel is only a reflection of the problem as a whole - that we struggle to face up to the reality of our so called “weaknesses”. ,
 ,
The first symptoms of my mental health developed around the age of twelve when after being singled out and bullied by even my closest friends, I developed long term depression and social anxiety that I have to this day. Almost every night through my teenage years I thought about killing myself but I didn’t talk to anyone about it until I was seventeen. I stayed silent for five years - not out of fear of a bad reaction, but more so because I didn’t want to appear weak. ,
 ,
At the age of eighteen I went to university and came across mental health charities like YoungMinds who I have volunteered with for the last four years. Through this time I’ve used my history of mental health to help others but I struggled to talk about or face up to the mental health problems I was experiencing. I feel comfortable talking to MPs and hundreds of people about my mental health experience but I was too scared to admit to my GP or my university’s student support about how much I was struggling. By the time I did, I had already left university without a full degree. In this way, mental health stigma made me my own worst enemy.,
 ,
Up until the last fifty years or so, Britain was a country that was in major wars often, with a far bigger military than the one we see today. As the role of the woman was to stay at home and look after the children, men were expected to be prepared to fight for their country. There wasn’t time for talking about our feelings amongst each other and instead we followed the mantra of “keep calm and carry on”.  ,
 ,
Society has changed massively in the years since World War II but this attitude still remains. To this day, men are less likely to go their GP if they have a health problem than women and this appears to be the same in mental health. More women than men are diagnosed with mental health conditions yet around 75% of suicides in the UK are by men. This is likely in part because men don’t feel as comfortable talking to others about their feelings- or at least that’s certainly been true for me.,
 ,
Some people say when men try to tell our male friends about our problems, we get told to “man up” but in my experience that hasn’t generally been the case. For me when I’ve told men I know well about my mental health the reaction I get far more often is an awkward silence. To me, this reaction isn’t so much rejecting me because of my mental health but much more so because we don’t know what to say. Because we rarely talk about our struggles within ourselves, we don’t know how to ask “How are you feeling?”, “Is there anything I can do to help you” or feeling comfortable sharing our own experiences.,

To take the time to listen and say a few supportive words is all it takes to be there for your mates and that can make all the difference to a person like me. "
,"Let me give you some background. I’m 38 year old Yorkshireman, now in Kent with my wife and two kids. I’ve worked in the travel industry my whole life. I live with , – I don’t like to say I “suffer” because I’ve made big changes in my life the last three years to ensure I understand my triggers and that I’m in control.,I’ve no idea how long I’ve lived with this. I remember at 20 having to take a week off from my work in France to have a rest. I thought I was just a bit burnt out and I didn’t really get what was up. I saw a GP back home, who decided it best to prescribe me a “new job” and “some chill out time”. I walked out of the surgery feeling a little empty and even more confused than when I went in. I returned to France the following week and just kept my low moods to myself. I guess because I’d not understood what was wrong myself, I couldn’t/didn’t want to explain that to anyone else.,So, 17 more years went by, highs and lows seemingly taken in my stride. Yet, during the last five years, with sleep deprivation and increased responsibility with children, it seemed the lows got lower, darker and were lasting a lot longer. My previous attempt to ask a GP for help – however badly I must have phrased it – really put me off going back again but the next appointment I made was one of the best things I’ve done of late. I pretty much broke down as soon as I tried to talk to the GP, almost relieved that I’d said something out loud and the person in front of me was full of empathy, support and a box of tissues! I had finally gotten over , or admit weakness. I’d realised that telling someone “I’m not OK right now” is possible.,The path my GP sent me down allowed me the chance to clear my head. The medication that I was so petrified would turn me into a perma-smiley zombie, did nothing of the sort. It reduced the highs and eased off the lows, turning cycles of peaks and troughs into a more balanced outlook. With the clarity came a confidence; a confidence to talk to people. I started with an emotional conversation with my wife. We were honest and said everything we needed to say – the clear understanding born from that day still helps us better understand each other now. From there, I explained things to my mum, then a few of my mates and probably some people I didn’t even know!,Once I’d started talking openly about it and not being ashamed or embarrassed, the pressures I’d placed upon myself in previous years – knowing something was up but not confronting it – all but dried up. The support from , when we talked was immense. The texts from the lads every now and again with a simple “how’s tricks?” was ample evidence that me opening my mouth and saying something was the biggest help of all. I’d pretty much ironed out my personal life in the 12 months after that trip to the GP.  Everyone knew in my inner circle of family and friends; help was there when I needed an ear and nobody was patronising or unhelpful – all was good.,There’d be the odd occasion at , though – after two hours of sleep and a mounting workload – where I’d just cave in at my desk and come to a shuddering halt. Not as bad as in years gone by, but still enough to make an eight hour day a bit of a strain. I didn’t want my colleagues to think I was being an arse. The ease of telling friends and family seemed a long way off when it came to the people who’d hired me, who look to me for guidance and who pay me. Yet my wonky thought processes were terrified my ,. When I asked my senior management team for a meeting so I could elaborate, I almost felt like I was back in that GP surgery again; dry mouth, palpitations and fear of judgement. Yet biting the bullet, I said to my bosses “I’ve got depression – I’m managing it, I’m coping but every now and again you might need to allow me the odd blip”.,I’d done it! Did it help? Well yes, much like the post conversation era with my wife, the people around me in the office understood when enough was enough, offered more help, shared workloads and allowed me time out of the office if I ever required it. Just knowing that people understood what was happening in my head helped me to really clear a path to work smarter and better with everyone around me. ,, just like I did with friends, helped them get what was going on in my head and they were a terrific support to me. I think I even reciprocally helped a few others myself, all through the power of talking.,That was like the final piece of the puzzle really. Some of us spend more time with colleagues than with our families, so it’s crucial to know that your team, bosses and whoever it is you work with, ,. Open honesty breeds trust and loyalty – a solid platform upon which you can build yourself back up with. "
,"I first experienced warning signs of my impending breakdown in autumn 2008. I'd been working long hours in a major bank, the financial crisis was kicking off and there were widespread rumours of large scale redundancies - or even the bank going bust. I’d just bought a house, my girlfriend's income was fairly unpredictable, and we were quite stretched financially.,I was going to the toilets at , to cry once or twice a day - sobbing, trying desperately not to make any noise. ,One day in October, I physically couldn't get to work - I just started to cry as I put my suit on, and couldn't stop. I took a couple of days off, then tried again. I made it halfway on the tube, before having what I know now was a panic attack. I called my girlfriend, who came to take me home.,I was diagnosed with , and ,, and it got much worse before it got better. It was a fairly unpleasant nine months, with daily , and a reasonably generous allocation of crying and panic attacks. Leaving the house became a real issue. Simple decisions - which socks to wear, or what to buy for lunch - were enough to reduce me to a sobbing, snotty mess.,The culture at work, looking back, was quite odd. It was fairly assertive and masculine - illness roughly equated to weakness, and mental health wasn't ever mentioned. We were well paid, and our job was to suck up pressure, work long hours and produce good work at all times – and this certainly didn't help when I began to struggle. A big part of the problem for me was , - I was disgusted at my own 'weakness'. How dare I be unwell, when I enjoyed good physical health, a wonderful girlfriend etc?,I was off work for a prolonged time, and my immediate boss was very supportive - one work friend was also hugely helpful. Yet otherwise, there was fairly minimal contact. I was surprised there wasn't a 'get well' card sent. It could have made a real difference, knowing that people cared. I'm certainly not blaming anyone I worked with - it was indicative of wider attitudes, and ,, towards mental health. I think the situation now would be different - attitudes have shifted so much in the last 5-10 years, thanks largely to work by campaigns like Time to Change.,As I recovered, I started to work part-time. I moved into the charity sector and gradually returned to work full time - essentially doing a very similar job now to what I was doing in banking.,I genuinely think now that my mental illness was an asset. I'm much more conscious about the need to achieve a better work-life balance; I now live in a more moderate, healthy way, with a shorter working week and less late nights. Also working in a more sympathetic sector, I've always been honest about my breakdown and I think , about stuff helps hugely. There have been a couple of times I've said to various bosses that I'm struggling a little, and their response has always been , - what can they do to help? I think my focus on staying healthy and my awareness of mental wellbeing makes me a better and more productive employee. Ultimately, being open and willing to talk about mental health has to be good news for employers, and good news for staff."
,"I was diagnosed with , and , when I was 16 years old and started counselling sessions. I was so ashamed of it, that I would lie about where I was going. I didn’t want people to know I was having counselling, in case they labelled me “crazy” or “insane”. I didn’t feel comfortable enough in my counselling sessions, as I didn’t believe it was confidential, so I ended up getting help with my anger issues but not so much with my depression and anxiety.,I pretended like I was fine for a few years, and then when I started ,, it hit me all at once. I was not okay. Even then I pushed it aside and pretended it was all fine. It got really bad at one point and I ended up signing myself up for the university counselling service. Again ,, I didn’t tell anyone about it - I would sneak off to counselling and tell people I was going to the shops or to meet my personal advisor.,It was also at university that my , got really bad. I have had bulimia since I was 14 but never told anyone about it - I thought I could handle it all by myself. My counselling sessions at my university were very helpful and it was recommended that I go to the university health centre and get NHS psychiatric help. During my psychiatric assessment, I had a nurse tell me that I was not depressed because “depressed people do not leave their rooms” and that I did not have an eating disorder, as people with eating disorders “don’t even want to drink water”. He also told me that he knew I wasn’t going to , or hurt myself and that I shouldn’t do it anyway, as surgery to get rid of scars is expensive. I left the session insulted and in tears. I started to doubt myself and wonder “am I really fine? Is there nothing wrong with me?”,My depression spiralled out of control after this incident. It took so much for me to seek help initially, for me to then be treated like this - it made me want to stay in my room and hide from the world. I would have some good days but I would have more bad days. It became a downward slope from then; starting with a few months of me being depressed and ending in me spending every waking second wanting to kill myself. I ended up getting hospitalised, as a result of trying to complete ,. I felt so empty inside, emotionless yet so emotional. It was like I was fighting a battle...against myself.,I lost a lot of , when I was going through this - it was as if I was a problem and wasn't “fun” anymore. I wasn't asking for much, just for someone to listen and talk to, but it was as if they didn't want to hear it or “deal with it”.,I then met this amazing group of girls who , - they basically let me move in with them, took me under their wing and kept an eye on me. They showed me that surrounding yourself with people who actually care about you can make a world of difference. We all helped each other and grew together; I eventually climbed my way out of a place I never thought I would get out of. I’m so grateful to those girls.,I still have clinical depression, and anxiety, but it’s getting better and easier to cope with and I am better at coping with my bulimia as well. My university counsellor also helped me significantly and never gave up on me - I see her as more of a friend than a counsellor now. I still have bad days, but I have more good days than bad and hopefully one day those bad days won’t feel as hard to tackle.,Mental health changes constantly and I try and take things day by day. There is still so much , surrounding mental health and I still find it hard to disclose my own mental health issues to people, unless I really trust them. I wish this wasn't the case, but some people don’t react in the best way when you tell them. I want to put an end to the stigma, as the stigma alone makes us suffer in silence and deters a person from getting the help they need, which makes recovery so much harder.,All I can say is that if you can ,, please reach out for help, don’t give up on yourself; you are worth so much more than that. And if you think you may know someone who is suffering, it doesn’t take a lot to help; it’s the small things you do that show you care.,I’m not sure if you can ever fully recover from depression and anxiety, but I want to get as far away from that dark place I was in as possible."
,"Talking about mental health in the , is an incredibly daunting and frightening step to take. Thoughts swirl around your head as you wonder whether being open about a subject, that is ,, will be detrimental to your career or your working relationship; “will colleagues treat you differently? Will it affect your chance of progression? Will you even have a job left!?”,I kept my , and , concealed from my employer for as long as I possibly could for those exact reasons. It was only when I got to breaking point that I finally had a conversation with my manager - Ruth. Luckily for me, she has been incredible in supporting me over the last 18 months and this has been a significant factor in my recovery.,The stereotypes which I most feared being tarnished with because of my anxiety were that I “must get worried about everything all the time” and that I “couldn’t cope”.,I was concerned that my manager’s reaction would be to immediately take more demanding work away from me and to halt my development. That was not what I wanted at all.,I didn’t want any fuss, any adjustments or anyone else to know. All I wanted was for Ruth to be aware of my situation because I felt that my behaviour at work was becoming obviously different; I wasn’t joining in conversations, I was struggling to focus and my time-keeping became erratic. I wanted Ruth to understand that my workload wasn’t causing my anxiety and that, actually, keeping as much normality in my working life as possible, at a time of massive mental turmoil, was key for me.,Fortunately , and always made sure that decisions about my work were made in partnership. Just the simple fact that I could have an ‘off-day’ with my anxiety and that Ruth was aware of what was going on, without having to have another conversation, really took the pressure off me. Looking back, I wish I’d spoken to her sooner because bottling up how I was feeling and pretending to always be okay was exhausting.,As a result of Ruth’s support, I’ve come on leaps and bounds with my mental health and confidence over the past year. She gave me the space and conditions that I needed to turn things around. She took the pressure off me without altering my workload or treating me differently to the rest of the team. She encouraged me to go to my employers’ counselling service and gave me the time off to do this. She understood what I was going through and always retained belief in me. I can’t thank her enough for that.,Consequently, over the past year I have really embraced myself and have become increasingly comfortable in who I am. This led me to take the decision to , across the entire organisation to try and encourage others, who may be struggling, to seek help. I have raised money for charity, designed and delivered mental health talks for colleagues and have also put a comprehensive business case forward to my organisation’s directors on steps they should take to ensure better mental wellbeing – including signing the ,!,Everything which I have done has been so well received by colleagues and I have been overwhelmed by the support I have received.,People have approached me to talk about their mental health and I’ve been told by a couple of colleagues that they have sought out counselling because I’ve made them feel more comfortable in doing so.,The transition I’ve been through over the past 18 months has been incredible and I am so glad that I can now help others to seek help. I wouldn’t be in a position to do so, however, if Ruth had not supported me. I hope my story highlights to employers just what can be achieved if they take simple steps to support the wellbeing of their staff.,Having a mental health condition does not mean a person cannot succeed in their career. In fact, my experiences have made me even more determined to do so."
,"We as people are social beings; we require and need human contact as part of our survival. I have suffered with severe , and , for seven years and often when you are in the most need for help, love and support, you isolate yourself from the world and avoid human contact. You can push the ones you love away, either by not speaking to them at all, or by taking your emotions out on them.,Going through ,, I had the most wonderful group of , who supported me after I came out of hospital and started therapy. We’ve all grown up and it’s harder for us to stay in touch now, but each and every one of those people will always make up a part of who I am today. I eternally thank them for everything they did to make sure I stayed smiling - honestly and truly. They stood in the dark corner with me and brought me light.,Since I started university, I met one of my greatest friends, not too long ago, who has been my light at the end of every dark and gloomy tunnel – and I hers. We have both suffered within. We have both had to battle our demons. But since knowing each other, we have not had to do this alone. We have supported each other through and through - I hope she realises how thankful I am for her friendship.,It can seem rare that you meet someone who truly , what you do, what you say or who you are. I can whisper my darkest thought to her and know she will not make any judgment – she will simply listen and help me to battle this dark thought. I can scream and cry and shout and she will sit and listen until I’m calm. It is truly refreshing to have her as a friend in my life.,We are two of the same but also very different. When life gets me truly down, as much as I may not want to speak to anyone, she is always there at the other end of the phone, a train journey away - ,When I was feeling low and had no money she supported me so I could go home and see friendly faces to feel better – and it helped. She knows what to say and do to make me smile again. Every time.,I could not imagine my life without this friend. There are many kind people in the world and I am truly fortunate to have a perfect handful in my life. She gives me encouragement every day.,Every day we ask each other ‘how are you today?’, It can mean so much to a person who thinks the world does not care. Four little words can make a big difference.,Read more on Tazmin's ,. "
,"It’s so important to surround yourself with , who care about you and acknowledge your mental health difficulties. You need a stable support network around you, even if it is just one or two people you can really count on.,I have had both good and bad experiences when it comes to trusting people, but it has never stopped me from remaining open about my struggles. I am so lucky to have a few true friends in my life that never judge me for my actions, never complain at me, and always support me when I need someone to talk to.,For me this is everything, because constantly battling my own mind is hard enough, let alone trying to argue with people who don’t agree that I have , and ,. I shouldn’t have to justify myself and yet I have to more often than not. But two of my friends in particular are so perceptive to my emotions and needs, they help me feel stronger even when I don’t realise I need it.,They send me messages frequently, checking up on me and seeing how I am doing. And it’s not just a generic “how are you doing?” to which I could easily reply “I’m fine”, it’s an open invitation for me to speak to them about whatever is on my mind.,One friend from home, we’ll call her Esther, always tags me in supportive and inspirational messages she finds on Facebook, which make me smile as she’s thought about me that day (we live far apart when I’m at university). Esther also calls me a lot because we can’t see each other very often. These are such simple gestures, but they can make such a difference to me, especially if I am having a really tough day. We both met at sixth form college five years ago through a mutual friend who ended up stabbing both of us in the back. But Esther and I stuck together – I helped her through a lot of self-doubt and brought her out of her shell, and she in return has become like a younger sister. We are both protective of the other, and I’m never afraid to share any of my problems with her because I know how much she cares about me.,The second one we’ll call Luna. Luna is a coursemate at ,, and she is one of the most genuine people I’ve had the pleasure of meeting. She always puts herself out for other people, and radiates kindness and understanding. We both struggle with anxiety, and that is quite positive for us because we understand how the other feels. Luna also messages me frequently – when she experiences an anxiety attack, when she needs to get something off her chest, or just to have a general chat. When I had a year out of university because of illness and had to come back to a different set of students in the year below, Luna reached out to me. She didn't have to, but that is who she is! She made sure I knew where to go and when, helped me to get to know some more coursemates, and was just so approachable from the start. It was so good for me to have someone there who was genuinely wanting to help me settle back in to university life.,Having mates in your corner to help you when you are struggling with your mental health is crucial! I am so grateful to have some true friends who would do anything for me, and who support me through all the difficult times that anxiety and depression hit me with. I know I am not alone, and it gives me so much strength to keep on fighting! This is why, if a friend of yours is struggling, you should be "
,"Hi. This is me. I am 39, a primary school teacher, lesbian, mum to a Labrador and two house rabbits, hockey player, student working on an EdD, outdoorsy girl and emotional! I mention this one last because it is what I want to talk about today.,I have a diagnosis of ,and ,. But to me, it is more that I am emotional! I feel things hard and this can be amazing or it can be horrendous. When I am happy, which is generally the majority of the time, it is amazing. I love with all of my heart and I enjoy and appreciate what may seem like the smallest of things. Offering to make me a coffee will get an excited response or bringing me flowers totally melts my heart. I listen to every word people say and am constantly trying to think about little things I can do that, I hope, will make others smile. I have so much love to give and I willingly give it away without saving too much for myself.,Then there is the flip side. Things that others may think is not upsetting may make me tearful. Unfortunately, tears are not something I can always prevent, however hard I try. The key is to know this. Tears are not a reflection on those around me.,If you say something and I get upset, then first of all, you matter a hell of a lot to me! Secondly, I don't need you to do anything about it. I would never want you to feel bad. If you can, then sit with me at peace and wait it out. When I stop, I will be able to explain to you what has happened in my head. It is not for attention or to try to change what you are saying, in fact that is the furthest thing from what is happening in my head. I am also not going to totally lose it, in fact the tears generally help me to pull it all back together. It is water falling from my eyes that often helps me to reason things out eventually.,The confusing bit is that it may not even be something recent that has upset me. It could be my head replaying some negative feeling that I have experienced. It could be worse because I am tired or hungry. It could be a general anxiety thing about something to come... or it may be because I am worried that I have upset someone.,The fact that I cry easily and feel things strongly does not make me weak. Never make that mistake. Imagine that you have lived for 39 years often experiencing the sort of feelings of upset that others may have felt only once or twice in a lifetime.,This is not ,or ,. I know this. This is me – an emotional soul. A soul that will love you unconditionally and care for you more than anything , that will seriously appreciate what you may see as the smallest of things, a soul that wishes for your happiness and will try to do anything to help to achieve it. In return, I don't need you to solve any problems for me or dry my tears even. Just understand that they will come and they will go, and being with me through them would be awesome if you could but if not just walk away and come back.,I manage much of this by taking some time out to read or walk Molly (pictured) and I can start these activities being very fed up with something because of overthinking and ending realising that I am being unreasonable or in fact totally wrong! I shut down at these times and if I am with you and doing this then I am doing it to protect you and me from the meltdown and I am so sorry if it hurts you.,At 39, this is not something that is likely to change. I am not sure that I want it to in many ways. I will take the rough with the smooth and hopefully surround myself with people that are able to cherish both aspects. If you are not able to, then I don't see this as a reflection on you in any way. I am much more likely to reflect on myself and consider what changes I can make. But at the end of the day, I will do whatever I can to make you happy if you are in my life. I can't change those intrinsic bits. They are me. If I lose the pain then I may not love and care about those around me in the same way.,This is the way my mental health effects my life and I just want to explain a little to start with. Thank you for reading."
,"That’s the first time I mentioned my mental health to my boyfriend. I can’t remember it exactly but we were still getting to know each other on a dating app and he was telling me about his neat-freak flatmate.,It was a bit of a white lie because I’m actually very obsessive compulsive. So much so that I was given a diagnosis of Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder (OCPD) along with the accompanying depression and anxiety.,It’s always been a big worry for me – at what point should I disclose my mental health issues in a relationship, if at all? I’m pretty open about my mental health difficulties, but , is harder because I’m always trying to present the best version of myself in a relationship. Can my mental illness be a part of the best version of me?,A few months into my relationship my boyfriend said I was a bit OCD. I realised that I hadn’t actually told him what my diagnosis was. By this point all I had said, in the vaguest terms, was that I had a mental illness but I wasn’t specific.,I don’t exactly have OCD.,The thing I remember most about this conversation is that I explained OCPD to him and he just understood it. I always have to explain that OCPD isn’t about cleanliness (which anyone would know from the state of my kitchen), it’s about rules, order and control. For me it’s about perfection. It was such a relief to hear him say he understood. I didn’t say how badly OCPD affected me though. He would soon find out.,The first time I had a , in front of my boyfriend was six months into the relationship. I was moving into a house with some friends and I was worried about where I should put my stuff in the kitchen. Where would be the “right place” for my cutlery? I was so worried that I started to hyperventilate and cry. I thought, that if I took up too much cupboard space, my friends would hate me. I had a meltdown. As soon as my voice began to crack my boyfriend jumped across the room to calm me. I was standoffish at the time. Once I’d calmed down I told him “I told you what I’m like.” It was a tense moment. It’s always been a fear that I would scare people off with my panic attacks. He ,’t run away. He held my hand.,I’ve been going through a period of severe depression. My mother passed away and it triggered a bad episode in which I’ve been having intrusive thoughts and suicidal feelings. I’ve tried to remain open and honest through this time with my boyfriend. The scary thing about sharing this stuff is that you know you’re making the other person feel helpless and you feel guilty for making them feel this way. So, do I regret sharing this with my boyfriend? No. Just him wanting to help me has been helpful in itself.,I’m terrible at taking my medication. It’s really special to me that my boyfriend can support me in taking them and that he appreciates what my body is going through when I take them. If I weren’t ,, about the medication I take, he would never be able to do that.,People won’t always say the right thing. When he said this to me it made me feel awful and guilty. It implied that I have control over being happy. I included this conversation because I want people to accept that when you’re talking to someone with a mental illness you won’t always say the right thing. But trying to help is better than doing nothing. I’ll always be appreciative that he tried to say something and that he wants me to be happy.,Sometimes people say exactly the right thing. I will never regret talking to my boyfriend about my illness. Sharing an open dialogue about my mental health has meant that when things get tough I don’t need to shut down or hide away from him. And why wouldn’t I share it with him? My mental illness is part of me; the best and only version of me."
,"Talking about it is such a relief, although it has taken me two decades to realise it. My story started when I was a child. Witnessing my incredible Mother experience two horrific mental breakdowns really affected me more than I could ever recognise being so young. I couldn't understand why she would be in tears on a daily basis, and shielded from us by my Father as she just couldn't cope with life itself. It wasn't until my own breakdown recently that it suddenly dawned on me just how dreadful coping can be during these times.,I was born blind in my left eye, and until surgery, it was more than obvious. I also appeared in school entertainment productions, and had moved to the area from a totally different part of England. So I became the easiest target for bullying in the entire school, and boy did these cruel individuals know it. I'm 36, and whereas bullying hasn't become less entertaining for these horrid people today, during my school days, it was an era where teachers very openly ignored it and dismissed it, simply expecting you to develop some magic internal strength to fend off the bullies. That's where my terrible , began, in those unforgiving school corridors and classrooms, where a punch or a kick was a daily ‘treat' for almost five solid years.,Life became serious and bleak from the moment I lost my Uncle Bob in the year 2000 and I was badly hurt following a vicious and unprovoked attack. Also in that year, I fell totally head over heels, and the relationship was perfect for the first few months. That was until she became abusive and violent. I'm not ashamed to admit this, it happens more than people realise. She had an affair and moved him into the house which I had spent over £2000 furnishing, simultaneously and singlehandedly decorating during every available hour at the end of my long shifts as a door-to-door energy salesman. Needless to say, I took it extremely badly, which is all I need to confess, as you can figure out the rest.,So in the year 2002, I had entered into a shocking bout of depression, but didn't realise it, and certainly didn't know how to handle it. I was so heartbroken by my adulterous ex, that I just took out a £5k loan, and once that had been blown, I obtained another £4k. I was out every evening after my shift, then all weekend, and sometimes I didn't even show up for work. I'm not proud of it in the slightest, but I suddenly started to drink very heavily, and I was also consuming enormous amounts of recreational drugs. Anything to numb the pain, but there was more excruciating pain to numb which followed.,There came a surprising call on my mobile phone from my friend Louise. We were a very close group at college. She called me to ask if I'd seen the news story in our local publication. I obviously hadn't and the next set of words she uttered destroyed me. One of our best friends; Nathan, the nicest, most generous and loyal friend you could ever wish to have, had been killed whilst serving with the Royal Marines. I was hysterical, overcome with emotion, crying uncontrollably. So I consumed lots more alcohol and recreational drugs, quit my full time job, and partied exceptionally hard for several months, until the money began to dry up. I ended up in a pile of debt, without the well paid job I had inexplicably ditched months earlier, and I was suddenly in an enormous hole.,Then came the day which changed my life, my outlook on life, and my hopes and aspirations. This day devastated me horrifically. The phone call came at 5:45am on Tuesday 26th November. It was the hospital in the West Midlands. My eldest sister lived on her own there, as she was a long term member of the University of Central England, and played in the enormous orchestra. The hospital practically begged us to get down there immediately. To this day and forever, I regret thinking that it was just a precaution and that it probably wasn't as urgent as they were making out. I was so incredibly wrong, it will haunt me for eternity. ,By the time we had finally arranged transport, it was far too late. My beautiful, talented, kind, caring, funny sister had been taken from us at the age of 29. My mother's scream is the most horrible yet profound noise I will hear for the rest of my life. My mind was in floods of tears, but my eyes were empty. It affected me enormously, and has done ever since. The guilt, the sadness, the regret, the questions, the sorrow, the painful loss and the memories. I don't remember getting through the next two weeks, arranging the funeral, emptying her property and helping to transport it up North.,Following my sister's heartbreaking death, so many traumatic events and incidents took place, you would actually question the legitimacy of my account. I lost several other friends and colleagues through very tragic causes. I have suffered broken bones on eleven separate occasions for a variety of reasons. I couldn't process my emotions, or comprehend why I was experiencing so many dreadful and unbearable dramas. And in the back of my mind was the harrowing image of those five years of torturous school bullying. So for a while after my sister’s death, I hid my troubles, kept guarded, and didn't grieve at all. It was, and is, the worst choice to make.,Then arrived one more sickening and cruel blow which has changed my world forever. After several years of abdominal pain and other horrible symptoms, I was diagnosed with Diverticular Disease, and in July 2014, I was taken seriously unwell. Scans uncovered a large abscess in my abdomen. But at the same time as this discovery, doctors detected the severity of my disability, and it was far worse than they first thought. I now have a very strong case of the disease, surgery isn't an option because of the risk and chances of survival versus the remote chances of success. ,The following year, whilst still extremely unwell, I was dealt one final enormous blow, which has eventually brought me here, to share my story. During a six month period in 2015, I lost three good friends, special people with families and so many years ahead of them. Years of “being on autopilot”, shutting down my fears and emotions, choosing not to lean on those supporting me, and failing to deal with grief, finally caught up with me. I'm grateful that my breakdown happened actually, despite how traumatic it has been. Because I no longer had any strength to deal with things on my own. I had no choice but to start talking.,Writing and sharing this story is a huge thing for me. I'm just about able to get up in a morning, take each hour as it comes, get through the day, and face the next day, knowing that I'm not alone at all. I have the most amazing ,, and their support is invaluable. But equally as important is the assistance from those going through the same horrendous battle with their mind. Depression is far too often belittled, undermined and dismissed. Thankfully though, we have organisations and charities like this. Talking about how you feel or how tough things are is vital. Please talk, talking about it is such a relief, it really is. , to anyone, even me, and once you start talking, please don't stop!"
,"One of the many, many, untold and unseen effects of mental illness is what it does to you psychologically, as well as physically. It affects us in ways you wouldn’t imagine.,Take ,, for example. People think it’s just being ‘sad’, when it’s actually feelings of severe despondency and dejection. People don’t quite understand my story, and by my story I mean my battle with multiple mental illnesses, specifically depression.,I told my friend once that I wanted to die and her reaction was normal; she cried, but she tried to compare me wanting to die, with her wanting to die to see what her ‘ex boyfriend would say’.,This is when I truly believed that she, nor anyone else, truly understands mental health and what it’s like to have a constant battle every day.,There is so much , surrounding mental health that to this day still baffles me. Depression stole my , and my education. But no more - because I chose to fight. I choose to fight every single day until my mental illness is no more. I choose to fight every day for my education and to get the ‘real’ Sophie back - and if that means taking medication for the rest of my life, then so be it.,It's so sad that there are still people suffering in silence due to the stigma surrounding mental health, because it's ‘not visible’. Well actually, it can be. You may see the signs, you may notice someone 'changing' from who they used to be but it’s not always clear cut. Mental illness isn't as visible as a broken arm. Mental illness is harder to identify.,Too many people use the statement 'I feel so depressed' when they have no idea what 'being depressed' is.,I’ve come so far with my mental health and yet I'm still afraid to ,. Why? Because you get labelled 'crazy' as soon as you mention the term ‘mental health’, as that's what everyone associates it with. ,Something needs to be done to create better awareness of what mental illness is and what it entails. I'm so fed up of people not truly understanding what it is and how hard it is for people; fighting through every day, when really you ,. Smiling inside, even though you want to cry. All you really want is for someone to notice how not ok you are and to truly understand what life is like for you.,I'm good at pretending to be ok, but that's not ok. Why should I? Yes, I want to die. Yes, I'm struggling badly but you can't discuss it without being 'judged' or scared, in case there are questions you simply don't know the answer to. Sometimes all you need is a hug and no questions. I wish I could change people’s perspectives on mental health and for them to see it as clearly as they see physical health.,When we change the ‘I’ to ‘we’ in illness, it becomes wellness."
,"I was 16 when I first started experiencing mental health problems, mainly depression. It came completely out of the blue. I hadn't lost anyone close to me or experienced anything traumatic, ,, almost too good.,I began to question everything I was doing, why I was doing it and if I even should be doing it. I wondered why I'd lived such a plain sailing life and then began to think that it was all too good to be true and began to live a life in fear.,I was turning into a living mess. I wouldn't go out in case something happened, I didn't get to close to anyone in case they hurt me or left me. I began living in isolation, which was not healthy for my mental state.,Things got to the next level and I didn't want to leave the house or see anyone at all. Showering became the toughest task but enjoyable. I found comfort in my bed, staying there to block out the world but sleeping was a nightmare as the thought of waking up was hell on earth. Living life was hard. The anxiety of life was overpowering and deadly.,My , began to get increasingly worried and pushed me to get help, which I did. Medicine and counselling has helped me back to being me but the best healing medicine I received was the love and support from my friends – one in particular who took the time to research depression, symptoms and how to help. She was like my guardian angel. She sent me messages near enough every day just to check up on me. We'd go walks together and just have cups of tea. Depression never leaves you and it's important that your friends never leave you too.,If a friend of yours is suffering from depression or/and anxiety and you want to help, this is what they most likely want the most:,You may think you're pestering them and forever bothering them because they don't reply but they just don't know what to say. They love hearing from you, imagining your voice say it while reading a text. These , lighten their day.,You may feel they're pushing you away, which means they need you more than ever. They may say they're fine and are coping, but they really want you there, in that moment hugging them close until the pain stops.,You know you have to put in the extra effort when they aren't cooperating, but don't do something you wouldn't normally do. If you'd usually meet for a meal, don't say let's go to the zoo. Keep things the way they were 'before.',Just let them know you're there for them and you mean it. Don't give them false hope. Be the friend they need you to be."
,"A lesson that I have recently learnt and am finally starting to embrace is that there is no shame in doing things at your own pace in order to get by. It is not ‘lazy’ when you can’t peel yourself from your bed because your busy mind has kept you awake all night and you are too exhausted to face the day. It is not ‘antisocial’ when, at the last minute, you can’t attend that event that’s been planned for months because your heart is racing and the walls are closing in. These are not ‘excuses’; they are indicators of much bigger issues that need to start being listened to and taken seriously.,Some people may not understand this at first, but do not let this put you off opening up and sharing your struggles. Most of the time, the reason that people do not 'get it' is because they are ignorant to mental illness, not necessarily out of choice, but because they might have never had the chance to talk openly about it – the more we speak up, the more people’s eyes will open.,, ,, , and other mental illnesses are interlaced with guilt, self-judgement and feeling unworthy. These feelings are only perpetrated further by the , and silence they are often met with.,I struggled through university, missed lectures and ‘precious’ time off placements, and questioned whether I’d ever actually make it to graduating and becoming a qualified nurse. It was a difficult time, but I got there. Despite everything, I graduated with a first class honours degree, got a job at one of the leading children’s hospitals cardiology wards and have made it through my first year as a nurse, despite many significant melt-downs.,A big turning point was one day, at the start of second year, my housemate asked me what was wrong and instead of saying ‘oh, it’s nothing’, I opened up and told her that I was finding things pretty challenging and that I was considering dropping out altogether. As it turned out, I wasn’t the only one and after living together for a whole year, we finally realised we were both going through the same thing – our stories were scarily similar.,Before that conversation, I couldn’t think of anything worse than , but it was such a huge relief and weight off my shoulders to talk openly to someone who understood!,If we hadn’t have had this chat, we wouldn’t have had each others help pull us out of difficult places with various wellbeing days, cups of tea and shoulders to cry on – or to celebrate the good days and the little things together.,With this in mind, I actively encourage anyone to speak up about mental health – even if you are not struggling yourself, you may be surprised to find how many people are!,If we spent more time supporting and looking out for one another, rather than judging, perhaps situations could change. We must change the dialogue and attitude to mental illness, and it starts with us."
,"I am 34 years old, and I have battled , and , for about 18/19 years. I have spent long periods in depression, and experienced periods where I have felt OK. However, in the last 12 months or so depression, anxiety and panic disorder took over my life. I struggled to focus on anything thing for any period of time, from work to going to the gym, or even just a shopping trip. I had a constant feeling of panic, or hopelessness, like I was living in fear of something, but I didn't know what.,After a painful life event, due to my illness, I eventually came to the conclusion that I needed to take control, and not let depression and anxiety rule me anymore. I've always been against medication but having started taking antidepressants, I now firmly believe that medication is vital for me, for now anyway. However, I decided that I wanted to do more than take tablets to prevent any further bouts, and so I did a great deal of research on self regulation and care, general well being, mindfulness, and neuroscience. I also attended talking therapy. I was pretty cynical about some of these methods and theories initially.,However, after a lot of reading and therapy I have managed to alter the way I think and how my mind works, and I cannot believe it's taken me all these years to realise to get better I needed to change the way I thought. In the past few years I've changed environments, homes, jobs etc because I thought these were a factor in my depression/anxiety, when the change I needed to make was in my head. I've also discovered yoga and other ways to bring me mental comfort. I don't think I've ever felt so focused, and not filled with a desperate sense of hopelessness, and absolute despair.,I used alcohol a great deal of the time as a way to mask my anxiety especially, and cope with whatever was on mind but all this did was pull me further down. I now only drink alcohol occasionally, to celebrate, toast or to enjoy a drink with dinner, or friends, instead of using it as a mechanism to deal with my anxieties.,I lost the man I love because of my depression and anxiety, but I am determined that they will not take over my life again. I don't believe every day will be a breeze but I can confidently say that I don't want to ever feel like I did when I was at my lowest, with what felt like the weight of the world on my shoulders. The feeling of hopelessness, and constant panic has been replaced with feeling calm, content and able to focus on the now.,During my research and reading I discovered lots of people who suffer different mental health issues don't , much, if at all, but when people do share stories they then realise they aren't alone, and others are experiencing the same.,Having battled depression and anxiety for such a long time I have really struggled in the past to open up and share with others what I was going through for fear of people's (negative) reactions.,However, now that I’ve started to talk openly to people about my struggles, it's something I wished I had done sooner. I cannot emphasis enough how important it is for anyone suffering with ill mental health to talk to others. But, yet more importantly, for anyone who thinks they know someone who is struggling with their mental health, be an ear, listen, and , understand that they are not alone, and that once they start talking they will feel better that they've opened up to someone.,A huge turning point for me was actually realising that I wanted to get better and make changes, and be in control of my life again. So far those I have spoken to have been nothing but thankful that I have told them about my past struggles, and few have gone on to tell me they have suffered in the past, and know what it's like. I am eternally grateful for these reactions, as I know full well that many do not receive such kindness when they do open up. If more people are understanding and empathetic about mental health problems, we’ll all be better off!"

,"My ,was the only person I had , during my darkest days, battling the demon that is ,. She has been my rock, my inspiration to fight on and the only person who’s made me feel loved.,Neither of us understood the first thing about mental illness at the start of mine, so Mum went above and beyond to become an ‘expert’ on the subject.                                       ,“It seemed Mum had a magical intuition, as she’d always send me a comforting picture or inspiring quote exactly at the times I’d be feeling my most alone, vulnerable or beaten.”,Mum and I have always been close; I’m an only child and still live at home, so we have become best buds as I’ve grown older. I feared my depression would threaten our strong bond but, thankfully, it’s enhanced and strengthened it to a level I never thought possible.,Mum has been with me to doctor appointments, taken me to counselling and waited outside for me, as well as reassuring me 24/7 that none of this is my fault, that she loves me unconditionally and that I WILL get there no matter how unlikely I feel that is. There is no doubt that without my dear Mum, I’d not be here today.,Mental illness is crippling; really horrendous and the most debilitating condition I’ve ever had the misfortune of knowing. As cliché as it sounds, I am actually very grateful for the ‘black dog’ coming into my life because it has made me the tough cookie I am today.,The ,surrounding mental illness is still very much present but there are some amazing campaigners out there who are doing a marvellous job in breaking these misconceptions. We must all rally round and support those struggling.,“Support from people who’ve been there, as well as that hand reaching out to you when you feel completely alone is, sometimes literally, a life saver.”,Don’t worry what your illness seems to flair up, or if you feel you’re losing yourself. For example I went from an avid gym bunny, to feeling too exhausted to even go to the toilet! I used to love doing my hair and make up but lost all the will to even brush my teeth. I had really low periods when I didn’t leave the house for months – I didn’t even go to the door if someone knocked. It’s been one hellish journey but, thank God and to my lovely Mum, I have managed to come out of this stronger and tougher. I’ve been to rock bottom, a thousand miles below and back again only to drop right back down again.,However, you CAN recover and you CAN count on at least one person to be there with you every step of the way. Reach out to your ,, join online forums and social media groups to connect with people who can become true friends.

,"I don't know what's worse: not being able to stop crying or feeling completely numb and emotionless. I watch my friends get essays and tests back. I watch their faces light up as they realise they did better than expected. While I look at mine completely emotionless. It doesn't matter if I got an A or a U, I feel nothing.,When asked by my therapist to rate my pleasure rating for all the things I've done in a week, it doesn't matter if I've done the most mundane of tasks or if I've done something exciting. My pleasure rating remains the same: zero.,People have this stereotype of someone with ,. They imagine someone who is unable to leave their bed for days on end. They picture someone with scruffy hair and dressed in dirty clothes. That image of someone sat curled up with their head in their hands has been ingrained within us as the image of depression. While yes, this is very true for some, it isn't the case for everyone.,For some like myself, we appear 'normal' (whatever that is?), high functioning, contributing members of society on the surface. But underneath there's a much darker and complex problem going on. One which doesn't always manifest itself in the way you might think.,During some days, I may be in the pits of despair, where I feel like I'll never be happy again. Half an hour later, I could be bouncing off the walls. My brain feels like its buzzing, almost as if the skull is the hive and my mind is a swarm of bees. Periods of hyperactivity, elevation and intense excitement are not uncommon with people with depression. Rushes of creativity, impulse behaviour and a lack of inhibitions. These extreme mood swings are often an untalked about symptom of depression because they don't fit in with this 'one size fits all' culture surrounding depression we currently have.,Everyone's mood fluctuates throughout the day – it's normal. No one remains in a constant emotional state but what if you had no control over it? Imagine being so hyper and happy one minute, then half an hour later sobbing your eyes out over nothing. This instability destroys ,. Who wants to be friends with someone who is as unpredictable as the British weather?,This is the time where I often will isolate myself from others. People have this preconceived 'one size fits all' idea of what suffering from depression is like. If you don't fit into this narrow-minded stereotype, you are labelled as being attention seeking and difficult. It's exhausting putting on a play every day to blend in with everyone else while internally you're going through World War three, day after day after day. Suddenly, isolating yourself from everyone around you doesn't seem like such a bad idea?,I can't explain to you the pain loneliness causes. I can't tell you what it feels like to have your friends blank you. Ignore you. The pain of having your problems dismissed as just being a stressed, depressed, typical teenager or how it feels to know your teachers are aware you're struggling but instead of asking how you are, they pretend you don't exist. Because hey at least you got to class, that automatically makes your depression ten times better than someone at home in bed, right?,Stop. Look around you. If you are sat in a public place, I guarantee that at least one person near you who has or currently is struggling with depression. You wouldn't know it. Because just like most mental illnesses, depression is invisible. Not everyone with depression fits the one size fits all stereotype.,Those who laugh the hardest often hurt the hardest. Just pause and think about all the people you think have it all. The people who are always laughing and joking, who are the life and soul of every situation. Bare in mind: you have no idea what's happening behind closed doors.,It's a daily occurrence hearing people use depression as an adjective. People claiming they are depressed over the most trivial of things. Little do they know what it feels like to have this crippling illness. Most of the time, it's not the illness that's the hardest thing to deal with, it's the , of those who surround you.,Don't get me wrong, I'm not blind to the media coverage and work that's being done to tackle the stigma around depression. It's great at first glance, but is it just as harmful to portray this 'one size fits all' stereotype of depression than it is to not talk about it at all?,For all the people who do get up in the morning, who get themselves to work because they know they have a family to feed. For all those students who get themselves to school or college because they know they have to, but live their day out with this ache in their body and emptiness in their chest. To sit down in the evening knowing deep down they are barely managing to get by.,No words can describe the pain major depressive disorder causes enough to do it justice. I can't explain what it's like to cry and cry yet when asked what's wrong you simply don't know. I can't explain what it's like to be ignored because people think you're attention seeking, as you are not in a permanent depressive state.,No matter how much people think they understand depression, they really don't. If you do one thing today, pause and ask your loved one how they REALLY feel because that conversation may save a life. Never take what you see at face value. Ever."
,"I avoid social settings due to some level of anxiety. If I’m surrounded by people who accept me then I’m relaxed. Formal conversations make me bored and uncomfortable, as I don’t feel as though I can be myself in those situations. I don’t exactly blame others for hindering my real personality coming out. If the general conversation is more superficial and not substantial, then I can go along with that for a while, but will duck out quickly. When talking with people, I analyse every angle of communication to figure out what is being said. I don’t drink but I’m sure that would be a respite from that.,In my twenties I did suffer from depressive / paranoid/ anxious thoughts which were a handicap but I would mask this effectively which isn’t that healthy. In my 40s I had psychodynamic psychotherapy (a form of in-depth psychological therapy) which helped take the edge off internal goblins which were hampering me.,I’m thin skinned and mop up the vibes around me. These are usually non-verbal like body language. I can quickly figure out the personalities in the room – I don’t mean that boastfully. If I was thick skinned and enjoyed talking just to cement relations with others then I’m sure it wouldn’t affect me as much. So if I’m around rude loud people I find that draining. Buses in London are difficult for this reason.,I have looked into Myers Briggs Typology (MBT – a form of personality testing) to find alternative explanations as a to why I avoid social settings. MBT divides people into introvert and extrovert. Extroverts need people to gain energy and feel valued. For introverts it’s the opposite. Introverts need to be away from others so they can regain energy to face the world again. My MBT type is INFJ and I feel that explains my personality just as well as a diagnosis of bi polar disorder,I’m not sure if my thoughts are always obsessive but my mind rarely switches off. I’m 45 now and have battled with these problems for 25 years, so I’m much better than I was. I did have crippling paranoia/inferiority and obsessive thoughts years ago and would dread a room full of people, who I generally felt inferior to. I would usually drink in the past to hide that and help me be more sociable and gregarious. I have found things in my life to help calm obsessive thoughts. For example when I’m at church, or in a state of prayer the outside world, and its drain on me vanishes for a while."
,"“Sickness can surely take the mind where minds can’t usually go,” proclaimed rock behemoths The Who. Listening to this as a young man empowered me to acknowledge and embrace my own mental health demons, which are many. The reason I wanted to blog about this difficult subject (hard for me to write about and hard for you to read) is because it’s so important to talk about. Suicide is the leading killer amongst UK men under 50! This equates to a man taking his own life every 2 hours.,I’ve experienced poor mental health for my whole life, but it was never acknowledged. “Oh, that’s just his way,” they’d say, or “just ignore him, he’s a bit funny,” or by simply being ignored. I was discouraged from pursuing all my dreams as I simply had to learn my place. On researching my family history I was shocked to find that four male relatives, the oldest of whom was born in 1920, had taken their own lives. I believe this was largely down to ignorance – were they to have had an injury such as a broken leg, they would be treated, given appropriate care and sent home with a clear plan of ongoing treatment and recovery. Had they been given the opportunity to discuss their issues or had the wider family been educated, more prevention work could have been in place.,I am very lucky in that I have a very supportive, immediate family who love and support me unconditionally. My partner has a great understanding of the causes and effects of mental health problems, and we have been open from the start with our children so they have an understanding and empathy with others. My oldest daughter is quite proud of challenging negativity surrounding about it and encourages my mental health to make not break me. My children have embraced my situation – my middle daughter says I should be lucky to have a brain made from rainbows! They are able to understand it in others, and when things go wrong we discuss why and how we put it right.,I have to accept that this is part of what makes me and is part of who I am. I have learned various coping strategies and am able to recognise the trigger warnings that point to a bad point. (I call it falling in the black bramble bush – if you fall into a sharp, dark place, the worst thing to do is struggle. You stay still whilst someone gently sets you free back into the light.) I am rather proud of this as some practitioners have taken on the analogy. Sometimes every day is such a struggle that few who know me would believe it.,I have been known to break my day down to getting through the next 30 seconds!,Sometimes I have to take medication to assist me, usually for between 6 – 18 months. The problem with that is getting the balance right which is largely trial and error. An unfortunate knock on can be the side effects: a recent roller coaster ride of tablets has led to me reacting emotionally rather than rationally – I am sure some of my friends and colleagues have received an email or call from me recently and thought “what the hell is he on!?”,The reason for sharing this with you is not to gain sympathy, merely to try to highlight a common issue that statistically will affect a large proportion of people. I have almost learned to live with my problems with the help of my family; I deal with suffering from poor mental health by using various strategies and humour, I have enough anecdotes from the last 30 years to fill a book and we often make others laugh with tales of eating out, being in public places or episodes of inappropriate behaviour but that’s just how I cope.,Men’s relationship with mental health is a challenging one. Asking for help is hard and as a man who feels an obligation to his family you want or perhaps need to be seen as the lynchpin.  Not only have I been afraid to seek help because I assumed I would be labelled and ostracised, but I had been ignoring ‘my injuries’ and I was getting worse because I wasn’t treating them. Imagine going to the doctors at 45 after trying to walk round with a broken leg for most of your life, not to mention the complications caused by it!,My name is Shaun and I suffer from poor mental health!"
,"Dealing with , and , can cause a multitude of different side effects. It can turn you into a completely different person; one that your , wouldn’t even recognise. My issue seemed to be my short temper and snappy outbursts. When I was once a relaxed and calm individual that enjoyed the slower pace of life, I soon became an erratic whirlwind of emotion that couldn’t sit still for five minutes.,During my second and third year of ,, depression and anxiety reared their ugly heads. After years of battling these two demons, and finally finding some peace at the age of 21, I soon felt the familiar feeling of sadness and a distinct lack of interest in most things, rising back up out of the shadows.,I noticed that I would become frustrated with people easily, I lost interest in what other people had to say half way through a conversation and I would start arguments just to release some pent up aggression. Before long, the majority of my friends had abandoned me. Unable to cope with my poor temper and constant mood swings, they left me to my own devices; apart from one friend. This friend stuck by me – why, I’ll never know - but she did.,I met my best friend Shannon in our first year of university - we’d messaged each other on a Facebook group that was made for Freshers. It wasn’t until our second year though that we became as close as we are today. We , of student life, of normal life and everything in between, but most of all, she never treated me differently - even when I was a completely different person than when she first met me.,During our final year, we decided to live together and it is then that she showed me how strong of a person she really is. I struggled to get through my third year of university - near the end I basically had a nervous breakdown. Not only was I at the peak of my depression, but my anxiety was out of my control and I had considered ,.,One of the things that helped me get through it was my friend and the way she treated my current state, as if nothing was wrong. Yet at the same time, she did everything in her power to make me feel safe and secure in whatever situation we found ourselves in.,She took me by the hand and helped me enjoy the last of my student days; sneaking off to less crowded parts of house parties to talk me down from sheer panic. When I teetered on the very edge of a full scale meltdown, she sat in my room while I hyperventilated and shook with an anxiety attack, and talked about the latest David Attenborough documentary, as if nothing was wrong., who wasn’t focusing on the fact that I was losing control, but acknowledging it all the same, helped me to get out of my own head and regain control.,Never did I think something so simple, as treating me like a normal functioning human being, would mean so much to me in the long run. Without her, I honestly don’t know what I would have done and thanks to all her efforts, I have happy and sentimental memories of my complicated and turbulent student days."
,"According to key figures from the LGBT Foundation, LGB people are two to three times more likely than heterosexual people to suffer from depression. I am one of these people.,It is only with hindsight that I can now see a correlation between my mental health issues and coming out as gay. During my year abroad in Spain, I started to develop feelings for a woman but it just wasn’t something I recognised or wanted to address. I returned home from Spain feeling extremely confused, but I pretty much ignored it, minus speaking to my best friend. And it stayed that way for almost 2 years, during which time I became extremely depressed and anxious in my final year at university. I’m not saying that this was the only cause of my mental health issues, but it played a big part. I felt very lost and confused and began to isolate myself so much that it got to a point where I couldn’t face seeing anyone, minus my parents and occasionally, my housemates. The feelings about my sexuality were put to the side whilst I went through the most difficult period of my life. Yet, after a long and hard road to recovery, they were still very much there. I just felt like I could deal with it more easily and start to process what was happening.,I’d say there’s some similarities between opening-up about being gay and opening-up about having a mental health issue, particularly with regards to acceptance. I was terrified with what my friends and family would say. I had this notion that some friends would be more accepting of one than the other. For example, my Mum was my anchor during my mental health issues, but struggled a lot more to cope with the fact that I was gay. Certain friends were extremely accepting of my sexuality but struggled to understand my mental illness. I guess, with both though, it just takes time and the willingness to understand. I’ve been very lucky to have such a supportive family and bunch of friends, who at the end of the day, just want me to be happy.,Another similarity is having to contend with stereotypes. I’ve honestly lost count of the amount of times someone has said to me, but you don’t look like a lesbian; or, you’re too pretty to be a lesbian. I think they genuinely think that it’s a compliment but it is not. I’m extremely comfortable with who I am, so I can brush comments like this off, but some people could find them offensive. Stereotypes associated with mental health are extremely harmful and don’t represent an accurate portrayal of what it’s like to live with a mental illness. There’s a very common misconception that, depression is purely down to laziness and that people could snap out of it if they tried hard enough, when in fact it is an extremely debilitating illness.,I would say that there is a lack of education and social stigma attached to coming out much in the same way that there is for people with MH issues. Neither of these were spoken about when I was at school. All I knew about MH issues were the stereotypes I saw in films or heard people talk about. I went to an extremely Catholic all-girls school and although the diversity of religion was talked about, sexuality was not something that was ever mentioned. I came out late, through my own choices, because I didn’t know until I was older. But I can’t imagine how hard it must be for those at school who feel too ashamed or scared to come out for fear of ridicule or isolation. Diversity should be celebrated, no matter your race, gender, sexuality or religion. But before it is celebrated, it should be talked about, recognised and seen as a good thing. Where are our positive role models? I think we need more representation in the media, films, TV programmes. Young people should not be made to feel ashamed or afraid of who they are. They should be able to feel proud of who they are and celebrate the qualities that make them unique.,I am gay and I do have a mental illness. But they are only certain parts of me. I am comfortable with who I am and I can honestly say that being open and honest with everyone I meet about these two aspects, has given me the confidence to be my true self."
,"During my life, I have suffered with severe depression. Being a professional sportsman and trying to put up a front all the time became exhausting. I reached the top of my sport, but getting there resulted in my breakdown, and subsequently my suicide attempts and early retirement. The chronic lack of self esteem and while trying to remain confident to family, friends and for my career was too much. Unfortunately for me, being a private person like a closed book meant no one saw it coming, which hurt because I thought people could see my struggles and ask me if I was OK, but it didn't happen.,Being a professional golfer or sportsman has made it difficult to be myself because of what the reaction might be. I’ve heard it plenty of times, people say ""why does he feel bad he’s got a good life"", but I worked for many years to make it seem that way, and always find it difficult to open up about the truth. This led to my biggest flaw, which is lying. I became so used to telling people what they wanted to hear that it filtered into my personal life, which ruined a lot of friendships and damaged my family. The thought of being honest after lying so much was difficult – I knew it would hurt the one closest to me, revealing the battle that I fight against my urges, every day. One day there will be complete honesty or I will have done so much damage there will be no one left.,What I hear a lot even now in this day and age is that you have to be a man and deal with things like a man. It’s so ridiculous that because you’re in the public eye you have to deal with these issues privately. I’ve found that sharing my feelings and my illness and my illness on social media and more importantly to family and friends has opened me up and shown me how much people care and want to help. Even people just wanting to catch up for a chat have made me feel that I am not alone. It doesn't deal with my depression, but it gives me some hope that with the right support I can eventually get my life back on track.,Around my last suicide attempt, I had one mate who was there for me. He is the only mate I truly trust and will open up to. He didn't judge me in any way, but just wanted to be there for me and make sure I was OK. No one has ever done that for me. I can’t even begin to thank him enough.,I guess a big part of why I wrote this blog is to show that your attitude matters. When my friend found me during my suicide attempt he treated me normally and with concern and his only words where “are you ok mate” to hear those 4 words meant everything to me. I assumed everyone would be disgusted at what I had done and because I am a man I would be ok and just get on with it. To hear those 4 words showed me that at least someone cared and understood I was in crisis."
,"I was diagnosed with pre and postnatal depression after the birth of my second baby. I kept quiet throughout my pregnancy until I was 32 weeks pregnant and then the Dr said he couldn't give me anything because I was too far gone. I then stayed quiet for 14 weeks until something inside switched and I knew I needed to seek help. I was given six sessions of cognitive behavioural therapy, but could only make it to three because of childcare issues.,When I was suffering with PND, I had two very good friends who would text me daily to see how I was. One of these made me promise her that I was to text her to say when I was feeling terrible and having thoughts that I was a terrible mother, so that she could talk me round to remembering how much of a good mum I was, or lend whatever support she could.,My friends really did help me through the darkest of days. They helped me see the light. They helped me get up and out when all I wanted to do was sleep. My friend Phoebe to this day makes sure I'm OK. And I haven't been poorly for months now. In fact, because of her I came off my medication, under the supervision of my GP.,I worked hard to become the woman I am now. It was so lonely being ill with PND and it changed my life. I was a shell of a women, with a fake smile. But it took one friend to ask me if I was really OK. She would just know when that smile was painted on. It's good to have friends like that.,I now have my own support groups for mums with pre and postnatal depression, or just suffering with loneliness. I understand how scary and alone a mental health problem can make you feel. It robbed me of everything at one point! But with my friends and the correct support, I changed that. Don’t get me wrong, it has been hard and still is. But I choose to be happy! And PND can't rob that again!,I support 20 mums in person and 400+ online. I'm now #inyourcorner for mums in groups and on my social media sites.  ,Mums from all over the world ask me for support and help. I am blessed to have met some amazing work through such rubbish circumstances. I work closely with professionals such as Mind to be able to deliver the best service available. Being a mum is hard. Really hard. But it's the best thing I have or ever will do,My motto now is to take each day as they come. If one day is hard it doesn't mean the next will be. I love being #inyourcorner and helping as many mums as I can.,I have had many friends with mental health problems and have seen them deal with it in the most wonderful ways. It's about finding something that works for you. But being the support means you need to be able to listen as that's often all someone with mental health problems wants."
,"People always have a lot to say about mental illness. Now I’d like to have my say, so I have decided to write my own story of what living with a mental illness means. This may not resonate with the feelings that many of you go through, but I do hope that it gives an idea of my everyday life and will therefore give you a better understanding.,When I was 18 I was diagnosed with ,. There were things happening in my life that I both caused and could not control. As I grew older, this illness manifested in many different ways; I could not understand my overly emotional responses to everyday life and the reasons that I struggled, in a way that was different to every forum post on depression that I read on the internet. It wasn't until a few years ago that I learned, after years of different general and medical practitioners, that I actually had ,. It explained the reason that I would shut down and sleep as a response to anything difficult in my life. It explained the random pains I experienced for over a year, which was actually a response to stress and loud noises.,This diagnosis, whilst unpleasant, unlocked a new stage in my life; one in which I could finally try and tackle the thing that was crippling and prohibiting me from being a “normal”, contributing member of society.,“I could now see that I was 'walking through sand'.”,This analogy is something that came into my mind last week but is something that I feel applies to anyone suffering from any mental or 'invisible' illness. Imagine you are in a marathon held on the beach. You and every other contestant are judged in the same manner and the same expectations are held of you. You start to run but you realise that everyone else is running on concrete and you are running on the sand. For every three steps they take, you take five. Beads of sweat are running down your face but everyone else is just chatting happily amongst themselves: this is what growing up with a mental illness is like - well for me at least.,Yet instead of using this as an excuse for every mistake I've ever made in my life, I've decided that I am going to instead use it as a personal appraisal. Not only did I do laundry today, but it was twice as hard and I accomplished it. I might be overly emotional but that means that I appreciate music (for example) on a level that other people may not be able to.,If you are friends with anyone who has a mental illness, remember to take note of their small accomplishments. Washing your hair might seem like a trivial everyday task for some people but I can tell you, on a personal level, that paragliding off a mountain was less distressing than the feeling I get when I wake up and get ready to leave the house. Similarly, eating a regular healthy diet or even cooking three meals a day is a constant struggle. Today I've managed one and it was from McDonalds (it was fantastic).,“Mental illness hides itself in all sorts of places. It could be within your family, friendship group or that friend from work who always has a smile on their face.”,All I ask is to consider the next time someone is late, looks 70 per cent, or has an overly emotional response to an ‘everyday’ situation, they're probably not a bad person; they're just walking through sand."
,"I spent the first ten years of my adult life living with the crushing weight of depression bearing down on me constantly. This weight stunted my emotional growth and development just when I should have been standing tall, emerging as the woman that I was to become. It took me a decade to find treatment that could help me. This decade left its mark: scars that run deep, flashbacks and fears that are never far from the surface.,As well as shaping who I was then and who I have since become, my depression also profoundly affected my friendships and relationships. It was so hard to be ‘me’, even to know who ‘me’ was, that I found it almost impossible to feel true to myself and connect with people in any real way. Depression drowned out everything else. And my inability to feel connected to people fuelled a vicious cycle of isolation, loneliness, despair.,I was lucky enough though to cross paths during these years with a couple of people who were able to see past my depression, to see more of ‘me’ than I could myself. I would like to say thank you to these people.,Somehow they were able and willing to see me as distinct from my depression – something that even I have not yet fully been able to do. As a result I didn’t feel I had to struggle to hide my depression, and so I felt real. What a relief this was! When I had to, I cried, I got angry. I made unfair demands, I ruined plans, I let people down. And I never felt judged for doing so, and I was never abandoned. My friends never added any guilt to my burden, and they never made me feel in any way like they thought I chose to be this way, or that they thought this was who I really was. I felt as if I existed, in their eyes, as Josie who happens to suffer depression – the depression wasn’t me. They were able to cut through it all and reach the real me and, incredibly, they liked me. When I needed it, they supported me and cared for me as they would for a friend with a broken leg or a bad cold. Ice cream, movies, cups of tea, quiet company.,I will forever be grateful that these friends came into my life and were able to see past my depression.,Since those worst times I’ve had some short spells that remind me of how hard life used to be. And I’ve been lucky again: one or two people who have come into my life more recently have been there for me and seen me through. They haven’t been scared of my emotion, or dismissed me as damaged, or stayed away because they don’t know what to do. They have simply asked how I am. Brought me something to eat. Handed me tissues and not minded my tears. They haven’t felt the need to offer a solution, but have been willing to just be there.,Depression is something I have suffered. It is not me. Thank you to the strong, kind people who have been able to see that, even when I haven’t been able to myself."
", ","I'm a 39 year old father of two, music producer and I’ve worked in many areas of the entertainment industry for the last 20 years. Although I’ve only just properly understood what mental health is, I've experienced anxiety and depression my entire life it seems, which has been further complicated by the suspected Asperger’s (high functioning autism) and ADHD that I'm halfway through diagnosis for. I’ve lived a very confused existence, not truly knowing who I am and being very insecure about why I feel and act the way I do.,I've been addicted to most drugs and alcohol, I’ve also had problems with over eating and binging whether it be with substances or food. I have physical health problems caused by my binge drinking and unhealthy lifestyle. I'm now totally free of these addictions and my liver has started to reverse. Over the years I've had serious accidents, fights, lost jobs, fallen out with countless people and had problems integrating into society and dealing with life as a whole. Throughout most of my existence I’ve always preferred to be isolated and away from society, as a coping mechanism for my insecurities and mainly because I tend not to get into misunderstandings when I’m on my own – life seems to be much more settled for me this way.,In 2014 I started a painful journey to the present day which ultimately ended in destruction of everything I cared about. It affected my family, I lost my partner of 24 years and ended up significantly in debt, all fuelled by my complications understanding the world and impulsive behaviour. I made a bad business decision which took away my structure, income and stability, culminating in me becoming very depressed and full of anxiety.,During this time I had several breakdowns and became unable to communicate, which resulted in self-referring myself to my GP for help to find out why I wasn’t coping. This then led me on the path to the present day with over 30 hours of counselling and 12 separate consultations later, I'm finally starting to get the answers to what has been going on in my life and giving me closure on many things I’ve lived a life of confusion about.,Ironically, I now feel the best I've ever felt about myself but have been left with a total mess of a life to look back and reflect on, with plenty of confusion and an inability to function some days. This didn't need to be the way it is, but I can understand that society is still in its infancy of being able to accept differences and that public knowledge has been very limited for the complications I've suffered.,Since getting the right support, making massive strides to better myself and understand my problems, in March 2017, I walked 200 miles throughout the month for Cancer Research. This was part of my rehabilitation, if you like, and it was a great way to mentally reflect on all the things that had happened in my life. Since December 2016, I have totally transformed my life in many areas that were causing me serious struggles before.,Talking is key – I cannot emphasise this enough. If I'd been able to talk years ago I wouldn't have needed to suffer and nor would the people around me. I believe that society as a whole was to blame in not understanding and treating metal illness as a second rate health problem. It feels like you should just get on with it and expect no support unless you became sectioned. As a teenager and young adult in the 90’s and 00’s, we never had discussions about depression or anxiety and I only really knew what they were properly last year, once I started the process of getting support for my problems.,For me, not having closure or the ability to discuss my problems with anyone created a world of pure confusion and deep insecurity about why my mind works the way it does and why I cannot connect with the emotions of others. It forced me to stay quiet and suffer in silence. If, as a society, we are all armed with important knowledge about how our emotions can affect us day to day, I believe that there would be far fewer people lost and turning to substances to create a world they feel normal in.,I’ve made it through a serious amount of challenges and I've not stopped fighting to get to a better place, despite continuous battles and problems always there to stop me. It’s a really hard place to be in where you have loads of friends and family but no one to talk to. That’s the biggest challenge in getting answers to your struggles, trying to get other people to understand and relate to the world you live in or have lived in your entire life.,I now talk loads about my emotions, but up until last year I hadn't spoken to a single person my entire life and naturally I was a ticking time bomb waiting to happen.,I signed up to become a Champion a couple of months back and intend to do as much as I can over the coming years to raise the volume on mental health awareness to try help people like myself get the answers and get them sooner."
,"I've suffered with anxiety previously and although I've sort help from my GP I have never really fully addressed the issue. In the summer of 2016, I started becoming unwell again with anxiety and this time depression too. Depression was a shock to me and I found it really hard to accept and understand.,I had learnt from previous times of being unwell that I tend to cut myself off from everyone. So I messaged my friends telling them I was struggling and that I was seeking medical help.,I am lucky to have a very supportive and loving partner and family. I also viewed myself as have an amazing group of close friends.,Sadly, from being unwell I am no longer close with one of my friends. I thought I had let her down over some plans we had made, so rather than talk to her, I avoided her – as when you have depression it's far easier to avoid someone or something than to deal with anything you class as being remotely stressful. She was left feeling rejected, having heard that I was talking to other friends and not her. When we did talk again, after no contact for a couple of months, she was frustrated with being let down and voiced this. This unfortunately left me feeling as though I was a failure and everyone would in turn leave me. She questioned my behaviours and, although I tried to explain, I don't feel she understood that these were the behaviours my depression had impacted on. Months later, we haven't been able to heal the divide and we’re both feeling let down.,I am coming to accept that my depression played a massive part in this rift, and that I was too sensitive to comments and withdrew from contact. However, I do not accept having to repeatedly answer my behaviours and explain why without this being heard or understood.,One of my friends once said to me that I don't understand mental health but I'm here to support you. This left me feeling so loved that my friend was willing to just accept the me that I was at present. Another friend has always messaged me and if she can't get hold of me she'll get in touch with my partner to check on me.,Sadly, when you become unwell, it often will be some time before you recover. How you respond to your friend when they are ill will have a massive impact on them. You don't need to be a mental health practitioner to support your friend, you just need to be you. Think of what would make you happy when you are sad, often it is something funny and not your friend trying to find out why you are sad or give you counselling. One of my other friends suffers with anxiety and was having a bad day. I bombarded her with pictures of cats dressed up as sushi – this made her smile and happy even if only for a moment. It shows you even the silliest littlest thing you can do will show someone you care.,Supporting a friend with depression can of course be difficult. My advice would be don't give up if you can, voice your upset but express you understand they are not well, recognise their behaviours and thoughts will not always make sense, reassure them you are there for them and finally send them pictures of cats dressed up like sushi!"
,"When we first confided in someone else about our ,, we may have heard the words, ‘But you have so much to be grateful for!’,
 ,
It’s a common response to mental health issues; sometimes said in exasperation, sometimes a genuine attempt to help us to look on the bright side. Yet despite good intentions, it can also be profoundly unhelpful.,
 ,
Some people may wonder why. After all, scientific studies have proved that practising gratitude has enormous benefits for our psychological wellbeing. So what’s wrong with reminding a loved one of their good fortune when they’re feeling low?,
 ,
What follows is my perspective based on personal experience:, about our mental health requires courage. We’re placing our trust in you, and how you respond to that trust is crucial. If your immediate reaction is to argue that we shouldn’t be depressed because of all the positive things in our lives, what we hear is that you don’t understand or accept our feelings.,Keeping a gratitude journal might help us on a grey Monday morning when we don’t want to go to work, but depression is so much more than a passing bad mood. In the grip of the illness we can be overwhelmed with intense and unbearable feelings of sadness, hopelessness or loss. Or so exhausted and numb inside that we can’t feel anything at all. You wouldn’t tell a friend who’d broken their leg to be thankful they don’t have cancer, and expect their fractured bone to stop hurting. The same applies to depression. We may be too consumed by pain to be capable of experiencing gratitude, or too drained of energy to try.,
 ,
Telling us to be grateful assumes that we’re not already conscious of our privilege. In truth, many of us are highly sensitive, empathic individuals who are affected by injustice and the misery of others every time we switch on the news. Depression makes us prone to low self-esteem and guilt. We may feel we have ‘no right’ to suffer as we do. So any hint (intentional or otherwise) that our illness is selfish or self-absorbed can send us spiralling into a worse state than before.,
 ,Each time a , speaks out about their mental health, someone always says; ‘I don’t have any sympathy for them. I wouldn’t be depressed if I had their advantages.’,
 ,
Although depression can be a reaction to adverse life circumstances, it can also affect anyone, regardless of wealth or success. Even people who are happy and content with their lives are not immune from episodes of mental ill-health. When we tell people with depression to count their blessings, we , of mental illness by implying it stems from a lack of perspective. A so-called ‘first world problem.’ In fact, depression exists across many cultures and has its roots in a complex combination of neurological, social and environmental factors, some of which are not yet fully understood.,
 ,
So , who tells you about their depression? Of course, it depends on the person and your relationship with them, but listening, acknowledging the reality of their experience, and offering your support without judgement are always good places to start."
,"For as long as I can remember I have been a thinker, a worrier. The most menial of tasks can strike me down in a stomach churning pit of nerves. That has been a constant throughout my entire life.,Depression to me was for weird people. Sad people. Lonely people. How could I ever be depressed? I am not any of those. I have a very supportive and loving family, and for as long as I can remember I have found getting along with people effortlessly easy.,Anxiety? Who on earth knows what that is. It is something that weak people suffer from. I might be a worrier and a thinker, but my resilience and will to continue mark me out from others. Anxiety is for the weak. I am strong.,I'll openly admit that was my attitude to mental health as a teenager. Growing up in the era that I did, with mental health still very much a stigma, and education on the subject none existent - I can hardly be blamed, or be alone in my thinking.,The first time I ever seriously thought that I might be suffering from depression was in late 2011. I had just gone through a break up, and studied for only 2 days a week on a foundation degree whilst all of my friends were off 'making something' of themselves at university. The spare time, lack of purpose and feeling of loneliness consumed my every waking moment.,I put my misery down to the recent break up and ignored my own internal cries for help. ""You can't go to a doctor. They will laugh at you."" I thought. ""You're just upset because you've gone through a break up. Time will heal all."",In this case, it did. Eventually.,When I look back at that period of my life, I see a boy that had only ever known success in his life that had to come to terms with a couple a couple of giant failures. Although painfully shy as a teenager, I had a razor sharp wit and was aware that I possessed a charm that people found attractive and comforting. I had never expected rejection and hardly had the tools to deal with it when it arrived.,Self-doubt, hurt and extreme anxiety manifested into anger and spitefulness.,Eventually, I got myself a part-time job, and managed to get a place at a University for the final year of my degree. My life had purpose again, and I would place the period between September 2012 and January 2015 as one of the happiest of my life. Although not without the odd emergence of the old black dog.,The second serious period of depression began in March 2016. The job I had worked in, with genuine success, for two years was suddenly changed forever when a larger company acquired us, and the changes this brought about became overwhelming.,Once again, irrational spite, bitterness and anger acted as a mask for my deep hurt and sorrow. I became desperately unhappy. Everything about the job riled me. I could not stand the people, the culture or the new pressures.,At the end of 2016, as is often the case at the end of a year, I reflected on the events of the previous 12 months. I realised that I had done many fun things, and had not felt one bit of emotion. The deep feeling of dread had loomed over me at every waking moment. I had essentially lived a year of my life on autopilot. Even if I had not realised it at the time. The anxiety paralysed me on several occasions. Caused me to say and do things that were completely out of touch with my character.,Anybody who worked with me in these times would've seen this, and suspected something was wrong. Or thought I was an arse (which was almost certainly the case with many of my new colleagues!),Yet to the outside world, I was fine. I laughed, smiled and continued to joke around just as I always had done. It was all a front. Being honest, I even managed to fool myself into thinking I was fine. So it hardly comes as a surprise that others didn't notice.,In early 2017, I read a book by a cricketer named Marcus Trescothick, whose international career was famously cut short by extreme cases of depression. The book inspired me to go and seek help. It was the best decision I've ever made.,I now understand my condition more than ever before. I am learning to challenge my anxiety, and have rediscovered the drive to beat it. I am allowing myself to feel positive. To smile and actually feel it. I still have tough days, and imagine I always will. But the coping mechanisms I have discovered in this short period of time are making life so much easier.,The reason I share my story is not for pity or attention. It is because the stigmas attached to mental health, especially in young men, are still so real. I am a normal person. A strong person. A reasonably intelligent person. This illness can strike anybody down, at any time. It doesn't target weak people, or weird people or a particular gender. And yet, one still feels the need to justify that.,I accept that some people will never understand and I am on terms with that, but I hope that my insight into the mind of a manic depressant helps understand the world we live in!"
,"I sit in the doctor’s office bemused by the diagnosis I have just been given. I hear the words over and over in my head, ""you are severely ,."" And before I can muster up the words of denial, the doctor delivers the clincher.,""Deal with this now or it will ruin your ,"",That was two years ago. Now, having successfully transitioned into a new position – one in which I have moved cities, travelled to New York for work and travelled solo through New Zealand for a month – I can reflect on how that day changed my life and career for the better.,At the time I had a great job as Senior Assistant Buyer at a clothing company. I believe I had been suffering from a hormone imbalance since my teen years for which I had never sought help. But at this point the stress of work and changing circumstances in my personal life tipped me over the edge.,As an employee with glowing reviews, I was next in line for promotion. But as the depression took hold, my mood and personality changed. I was short tempered and forgetful and within weeks this damaged the reputation I had built. I went from a respected member of the buying team to someone who was barely hanging on to my job.,Eventually I was seconded to a different team within the company. It was a huge relief, but I knew that before I started I needed to get help. This was when I sought professional help and was diagnosed with severe depression.,I started a mix of psychotherapy and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). I also notified my new managers of my depression and with their help completed my year’s secondment without any issues. Being honest with my line manager made things much easier for me. It meant we could put a plan in place so I didn’t have to explain from scratch why I might need to be a little more flexible with my working hours. Knowing I could call up and say I was struggling to come in at any point without explanation meant my , around returning to work was reduced significantly and as a result I never needed any more time off.,And during this period of my career I was lucky enough to meet Sarah Curran MBE, the online luxury fashion entrepreneur. In a ""Coffee with a Director"" session, Sarah spoke about how therapy and continued personal development had made her the woman she was is business. For the first time, I understood how much of a blessing my diagnosis has been. I finally understood the value of what I had learnt through hours of therapy and realised my diagnosis would be the making of my career.,With an average of 80 applications per job in the UK, you are likely to find 20 applicants per job who have experienced a mental health problem that year. And this begs the question ‘who is the ideal candidate?’ Someone who can work under pressure seems a popular ask of most job specs, along with being reliable, a strong communicator and of course, having the right attitude. Not necessarily traits that are associated with someone who has suffered from depression according to stereotypes.,A high-pressured role in a fast-paced society may seem completely unsuitable for a candidate who has suffered from mental health issues. But post recovery, I find I couldn't be more equipped.,With a strong support system in place as a sounding board for any difficult decisions, a strategy for coping with both the physical and mental symptoms of stress and a wealth of experience to draw on, I often find myself the pillar of calm where others crumble.,I think having suffered from depression and tackled it makes me a stronger potential employee. Perhaps the ideal candidate is someone who knows their strengths and weaknesses, someone with the tenacity to make it through the toughest of situations, and someone who can empathise with other team members. All qualities that rarely come from living an easy life.,Yet still, when I am asked the interview question, ""tell me about your biggest accomplishment, either in your working or personal life,"" I steer clear of revealing my battle with depression.,It is time to recognise that if rough seas make skillful sailors, overcoming depression can make stronger candidates. The-1 in-4 candidates who have suffered from some form of mental health problem can be some of the stiffest competition in the job market today."
", ","I have been a working professional for over 30 years. During this time I have been able to make a decent living, meet great people and have a good standard of life.,As a young man I took everything in my stride – the learning, the travelling, the growing demands on time, the exams, the late hours, lack of work/life balance, the pain of failing and the excitement of succeeding and making a difference.,Somewhere, around about 10 or so years ago I suppose, the highs started to diminish and the lows became deeper. Not permanent, but deeper, much deeper. What was going on and why?,I still do not know all the answers to these questions but I do now understand a lot more about myself and a great deal more about the issues I have been facing – or more accurately refusing to face. One thing is very clear to me – I failed to take care of my mental health and consequently I ""hit the buffers"".,Still in early 2017 ""depression"" is a word that conjures up a range of responses and images – all of them pretty negative. Someone who suffers from depression ""can't hack it"", is ""weak"", is a ""risk to the business"". I disagree.,Even a cursory glance at the national and international statistics prove what a widespread and worryingly common affliction depression is. I say affliction because although I suffer from it and am still receiving medical treatment, I am still not sure whether I am ill, I have a disease, a genetic problem, or ""simply"" have developed a habitual way of thinking that needs to be corrected and re-balanced.,""Simply"" – if only it was. I know little of science or medicine, but I do know that the mind, the brain, our ways of thinking and our ability to develop ingrained habits, particularly unhelpful ones, is a frighteningly complex issue.,In the context of my experience, what makes a perfectly rationale, reasonable, successful, happy and balanced (well almost!) professional find themselves at times literally unable to function, to drive a car, to make or receive a phone call, to write a coherent paragraph, to lose his ability to problem solve and become an anxiety wracked shadow of his real self?,For me these debilitating periods of my life started during my 30s and grew more and more intense and more and more frequent with age. The ""triggers"", which I now understand periodically set me on a path of temporary self destruction, have been increasingly activated at lower and lower thresholds.,Thankfully, and simply because things became too difficult for me (and my family) to manage, I finally fronted up to my condition – I stepped back from the heat of the workplace and have invested the best part of the last two years understanding, accepting, and most importantly of all, actively tackling my problem.,It hasn't been easy and still isn't, but neither, surprisingly, has it been all negative.,I have been both amazed and totally humbled by the response of my closest friends, colleagues, clients, partners and associates throughout my industry to my plight. Truly humbled. Hardnosed and hard-pressed professional business men and women have been so empathetic, supportive, so understanding, loyal and caring. Without doubt this collective response was the beginning of the end of my darkest years. Bringing my issues into the open (disclosure is the technical term I think) and facing up to them with the help and support of those I admire, respect and want to work with, has been my salvation.,So I am on a journey. If I was a car I would be firing on 3 cylinders now but I can feel the full power of the engine beginning to kick back in. When I started out in my profession (property) we talked of properties suffering from ""sick building syndrome"" lacking natural light or good ventilation and having obsolete mechanical and electrical systems.,We are now much more enlightened. We talk about designing buildings that actively improve our well being, promote our health and happiness – and rightly so. My thinking is – if we put this much emphasis into our modern day buildings and spaces surely we can all learn to invest more time and consideration to ourselves and our minds.,From here on in, I will never again feel the need to ""hide"" my feelings from those I love and those I work with. I may take professional life a bit easier, as a consequence of my condition, but have learnt that this is not failure, just realistic. After all we are not all Prime Minister material."
,"I’m Chris. I'm 21. I've lived with , for most of my life, ever since I was a kid. I never used to understand the thoughts and feelings that I had. In my teenage years, I started to develop feelings of low self-esteem and confidence that affected my everyday actions and thoughts. I never talked to anyone about what I was going through – ever. I just hid my thoughts and feelings and thought I could deal with it that way. That was such a mistake. Depression it's like a bad wound: if you don't treat it and get it seen too, it can get infected or worse. I learned that the hard way.,When I hit 19, I started to react more, I started to feel a rush of those same thoughts and feelings. This time around it was far worse. I was confused: I was happy, had loads of friends, got a job that year, got a distinction from my course, and I was feeling great and I didn't get that. It was like I reached the top of the mountain only just to topple and fall all the way back down and even further. I asked myself what had happened, I didn't understand. It was like someone had set my emotions from 10 to 100. My confidence and self-esteem was at an all-time low – and with them in the dirt, I started to experience desires to ,. It was another problem that quickly grew out of control. I'd go home nearly every night and hurt myself, and then cry myself to sleep.,What a lot of people fail to realise is that depression doesn't just affect you, it can affect those around you. A lot of my so-called ‘friends’, who I thought would be there for me, just upped and left. I was only left with the handful of true , that I still have today. This only fed my depression even further. I felt like a used tissue, discarded and flushed away. The experience left me with a recurring thought: ""Everyone will leave you in the end"".,My mother didn't notice until I told her about my feelings and self-harm. She booked an urgent appointment with my doctor, and I was diagnosed with clinical depression.,Despite this turn, I still felt so alone and dissociated from my few friends and family that I started to have thoughts of ,. Eventually, down the line, I made a move to attempt it. I started to perform the actions needed to end my life. As I was, I had a sudden spark in my head telling me “NO! STOP! WHAT ARE YOU DOING!?!?” That spark that day saved my life, I called an ambulance and was rushed off to hospital.,Life has a certain way of surprising you in a good way – even in your darkest of times. A few days after that I met my girlfriend who I'm still with today. At the time with what I was going through, I instantly thought ""she's going to leave me"". She didn't, and we'll be celebrating our two year anniversary soon. I was finally admitted to therapy where I was helped to understand my depression and deal with it. I feel so much better now. Therapy for me was like cleaning a wound: it hurt at the time, however, I healed and I'm thankful for it. I'm also thankful for the people who didn't leave me and who stuck by me through that tough time. Because it can be tough to deal with, whether you're going through it or seeing someone go through it. So I say to anyone reading this, if you're going through hell – keep going. My true friends, family and my girlfriend helped me get through my years of hell and I'm forever thankful to them.,Whenever I can now, I try to help those who're in the same position as I was. Whether it's just listening to them, providing advice and giving understanding to help. Just reaching out and saying “I'm here” does wonders. It could help save a life. And that's what everyone who loved me did. They were in my corner and I'm forever in theirs."

That the , is as real as it gets and that the only way to fight it is through education.

", ","People tend to ask me: why are you depressed, you have such a nice life? My simple response is… I don’t know. Depression wasn’t something I could control; neither was my anxiety. Back in 2013 I was sitting my art exams and self-doubt got a hold of me. I was constantly criticizing myself to the others around me. I felt that I wasn’t doing well and it was something I was doing. I got into this spiral where every lesson I was whirling downwards and I couldn’t control my emotions. This mood started to spread. I found it especially hard with my failing grades in art as this was the form where I could express myself away from poetry.,I approached my GP in September 2015 and I started to get some treatment. Various different prescriptions and therapy and I still didn’t feel like anything was helping; this only started making me feel worse, with a dreaded fear that things wouldn’t get better. Towards the end of 2015 I went to my doctors after having a mental breakdown and I remember after being referred to the local crisis team, the nurse told me to ‘snap out of it’. To this day, this is one of the comments which stay with me. It caused a horrible phase of withdrawal that was very painful on my mind. I felt isolated, scared, alone and lost – falling into this abyss which was my own mind.,What also followed was what I felt was discrimination from family and school peers about my mental health. I had days where I felt positive, however there was always that depressive thought in the back of my mind telling me otherwise; and it started to win. I started to believe that this was all my fault. In June 2016 I made an attempt to end my life. My physical health, my mental health and relationships with those around me was getting all too overwhelming for my mind to handle. Since the start of my mental health journey in 2013, after a long battle, I was diagnosed in August 2016 with clinical depression and generalised anxiety disorder.,Since working with Time to Change, I have been able to speak up to those around me. The statistics I learnt throughout my training shocked me, and it's horrible to think how many young people like me struggle with their mental health nowadays and on top of that they are victims of stigma and discrimination. I wouldn’t want anyone I care about to feel how I do, let alone the vast majority of people in the UK and worldwide. Would you?,Despite it being hard for me to express how I feel deep down, the people around me mean the world. If it wasn’t for those beside me, I wouldn’t be stood here sharing my story today.,The one thing that helped me the most was when someone saw me at a low point crying and they looked me dead in the eye and said… “Even though you may be sad, I still see the ambition in your eyes”. It reminded me how determined I was to fight through my mental health and that tiny spark of self-esteem reignited.,Or perhaps it was the time that I was an emotional wreck alone at home and I called my friend who rushed over just to give me a , (it’s Welsh for Hug). She didn’t judge or ask lots of questions… she just let me talk and most importantly was there for me in my time of need. The worst thing when someone is at a low point is for them to be made to feel as if it’s their fault, or to feel like they’re being questioned for what they’d done wrong. Since then I’ve been passionate to share my story. I know that other people are struggling, just like I was.,Just being there to talk makes such a huge difference. It doesn’t take much to listen to a friend when they need to get their feelings off their chest. Being a sensitive listener, and asking questions when your friend is comfortable with it, so you can know more about what that person’s going though – that’s what being in someone’s corner is about, and it’s really changed my life.,I still have days where I feel useless or that I’ve messed everything up, however now I feel like there are positives which I can look upon and go towards. I don’t want to tell you I know what it’s like… because everyone’s story is different; however, I want to tell you that there is a route of light. With the right support and people around you, you can start to see the path again. Even though I know that there’s the chance of that depression and anxiety will remain, it’s about control and finding content with your mind again… and as my favourite quote goes… , (Ziad K. Abdelnour)"
,"I have battled with my mental health for as long as I can remember and so I have had plenty of time to come to terms with my mental illness, to learn what it is and ways of managing it. That being said, I suppose my mum has also had a lot of time to come to terms with it, to come to terms with having a child that suffers with her mental health and as a result needed extra support.,I have a diagnoses of depression, anxiety and distress intolerance and as a child I remember being tearful and often on edge, worrying something bad was going to happen and not understanding why. After numerous GP visits I was eventually referred to the child and adolescent mental health services and since then the mental health services have been a part of my life. Throughout my life treatments have included medications, talking therapies and an inpatient hospital stay, but I feel the most important and lifesaving thing was having my mum has a constant support.,Since the day I was born, I've had a built in best-friend. She’s protected me, supported me and taught me everything I know, she taught me right from wrong and eventually taught me to have strength - I'm lucky to of had that. I remember as a young girl having a conversation with my mum because I was scared that it didn’t matter she was my mum, she could still leave me if she wanted. I thought ,That’s the tricky thing about a mental illness, it changes your perceptions on things and if allowed will make you feel so alone, so vulnerable, it allows you to live on what if’s.,Now this is where my mum saved me, at a time where I thought I wasn’t worth anything, wasn’t able to be loved my mum made it known that she was there for me, that having a mental illness didn’t change a thing in her eyes, I remember her saying that ‘,’ and this was just a part of that. Then she changed my whole perception of mental illness in a second when she said;,’,My mum was right. Those few words of encouragement, of love changed my life because it gave me hope and taught me mental illness is a natural part of life and nothing to be ashamed of. As a young girl mental health wasn’t discussed openly and certainly not in a positive light. There was no education regarding mental health and so as a result my friends were not supportive, they didn’t understand. This is where having my mum's support was invaluable, she was firm when I needed it, always honest and never let me hide behind my illness, in fact she taught me to have pride in my strength and compassion in my struggles.,By having just one person in your corner, to just talk and offload your worries it gives you strength. My mum isn’t a superhero, although she may as well be, she didn’t need any powers to help me through it all, she just gave me her time and support, small gestures can be lifesaving. She was in my corner and having that can be the difference between feeling able to conquer the world and it being the end of the world."
", ","I'm Della. I live in a house share in a different town from my family. I work full time and I have to get through all my daily chores alone and ploughing through the darkness of depression. It's hard, really hard.,Depression doesn't care if I have to get up early and work a nine hour shift; depression doesn't care if I need to get into town to do some basic shopping; depression doesn't care if I've made arrangements with friends. I can be perfectly happy one day and wake up the next day with the dark sadness and suicidal thoughts – there is no warning and there's no way to stop it. Having been living with depression for years, I take daily medication and I attend regular GP appointments and counselling, but none of that can stop depression.,The hardest part for me to handle is how it affects my work. I love my job and the routine of going to work every day, and being surrounded by the staff who are loving and supportive is the best feeling. But when depression is hovering, I can't deal with work – all I want to do is sit and cry and feel sorry for myself. I need a routine to keep myself focused, and if my routine changes it can take me a long time to adjust and I know it will have an impact on my mental wellbeing.,When depression visits me, I struggle to work, I don't eat well, I self-harm and I have thoughts about ending my life. It's a scary place, and although I have the support of friends and family, I tend to push them away. I don't know why, maybe it's the thoughts I have and the shame I feel that I can't control my own mind.,I'll be honest, I've lost friends. I've nearly lost family in the past when my mental illness got the better of me and I tried to end my life. None of that matters now, I'm just coming out of a depression episode and, as hard as it was, I'm still learning about my mental health and so are my family and friends. I'm blessed to have the ones who have stuck by my side, who bring me chocolate when I'm sad or sit in A&E with me when I'm at a low point. I'm tired of hiding my thoughts and hiding my self-harm. If I'm in a low point I want to be able to tell everyone close so they know I'm not just being miserable, unsociable or boring but because I'm dying inside.,I used to hide my mental illness. I hid it from my ex-boyfriend for a long time, too long. I was ashamed and I honestly thought I couldn't be loved. I hated myself, I still do at times, so why would anyone chose to love me. It wasn't until things got particularly bad that he found out. I guess it's thanks to him I'm so open about it now. He was amazing and supportive, and for once I didn't feel alone. I had someone by my side who was listening to me and didn't judge me.,I'm blessed to have my mental illness, in a sense, as it makes me appreciate life and I know first-hand how quickly it can be ended.,Love yourself, you are doing a great job and if all you did today was get out of the bed then please be proud and shout it from the rooftops.,And be in your mates’ corners – take it from me, it makes a huge difference to someone going through depression."
,"Suicide is a big word! From seeing it portrayed in the media to reading people’s personal stories, either a family’s experience or the person themselves, it can be scary to even think about. My journey with it began when someone close to me experienced suicidal thoughts, but I never really understood what they were going through at the time, how it could affect someone mentally and physically – feeling so low and wanting to never , about what you’re going through. But I’ve learned through experience that it’s so important to try to understand others and be there for someone as much as you can if they are going through such dark times.,My own personal experience started three years ago, in 2014, when I was friendless, and though I had family around me, I still felt alone with no-one to talk to. I was at my lowest. But an aspect of my life changed, I moved away from somewhere I didn't want to be. However, I told myself that if I was ever to go back to that place, then it'd be time to end it all, and that I wouldn't be missed.,I went months without going back or it coming up at all, but then suddenly and unexpectedly I was put into a new position, seemingly without any choice in the matter. A couple of weeks later I was back at that place I never wanted to be, my mind racing, becoming ever more dark and without a way out.,My cognitive behavioural therapist asked me have you ever gone so far as to plan where you would go, I said I had but this was before I knew I was to go back to the place I never wanted to be. All this became too much – eventually I broke down had my first ever anxiety attack (without realising it at the time) I revealed my darkest thoughts of suicide.,But the weight hadn't yet been lifted. How could I tell my , I was feeling ever more like a burden? Eventually I told them, and some new friends too. One person thought I only have these thoughts due to the other person in my life having them – I don’t think this was ,, but a misunderstanding that about how people can be affected by their mental health. Otherwise, every one of the people I spoke with showed their support. It was upon revealing what had been going on in my head that I found what others were like really.,It's also during this dark period in my head that I learnt what my mind is capable of and surely what other people’s minds are capable of, and how not talking to those who matter most to us can lead us to the darkest of mental states. What I have also noticed is how mental health can bring us together at times we wouldn't expect. I am most grateful for the people I have met battling my mental health.,Whoever reads this post I hope would learn not to be quiet when someone is experiencing such thoughts, and to talk to friends if they're acting different. Though I understand not everyone will be understanding of such intense thoughts and emotions, literally everyone from someone you know to a random person on the street should learn to ask ""are you ok?"" and not judge the answer.,For example, I experienced something unpleasant on the day before my thoughts and anxieties came to a head. I was walking home, I was clearly upset and experiencing a tough time, when a woman passed me by looked me squarely in the face, clearly seeing that I was upset, yet she merely looked at me like I was weird and carried on walking. Whilst it might have been strange to me I would've appreciated her stopping and "",?"", or at least a smile, instead of the judgemental staring.,My experience with these thoughts has made it clear to me that attitudes towards suicide and suicidal thoughts needs to change, and indeed attitudes around mental health in general need to change. If you have suffered with your mental health or suicidal thoughts don't remain silent. If you know of someone who struggles with their mental health, talk to them and let them know they’re not alone. Then maybe people would remain less silent on this ever pressing matter."

,"Matthew, well ‘,’, is the oldest friend I have. We actually met walking to primary school on the very first day and have been , ever since. We went through school and college together and although we went to different universities and both moved away for a number of years – whenever we met up it was always like we’d never been away. This is still true now nearly 40 years later.,Matthew experienced ,, but they never really had a ‘full-blown’ , about Matthew’s mental health. I first found out through other people and probably spoke to others about it more than with Matthew directly. I guess in a group of friends people have different roles and I tend to be more the one who will laugh and joke and just do normal stuff with him. But I also know there’s other really good mates who he talks to and he knows he can always talk to me in that way if he ever needed it.,I probably didn’t appreciate the full extent of the problem the first time Matthew was diagnosed with depression. I’d lived away and not spent much time with him in the preceding years so hadn’t been that aware of any major problems. Obviously when I did see him, yes he was definitely withdrawn and not his usual cheery, chatty self. But you only see this in isolation and in small doses so don’t appreciate the full picture.,The second time it happened I was much more aware and made more of an effort to make contact and do things together. Just little things like a game of darts or pool or going to the cinema – nothing major – but it is often those things that people don’t do and just focus on the depression. I tried to take him out of that bubble a little whenever I could. I would find time to meet up – even if it was just for an hour at lunch – for a bite to eat and a game of darts. Although with our darting ability – or lack of it! – an hour was rarely enough to finish a game!,When you’re , through something like this, it can be easy to think you need to ‘be different’ or not talk about certain things. But I honestly believe being yourself and not treating things as anything different helps. I’d say people don’t want to feel different, and being able to keeps things normal is a big help.,Make an effort to spend time with them. You know them better than most and will be able to judge the situation, and how the person is, a lot better just by spending even a little bit of time with them. I’d also suggest bringing up things from your own personal life that the person may not know. It doesn’t have to be anything major – but being a bit more open about things, especially as a man, can often encourage a good friend to do the same. You never know when that moment may come when they just need to talk to you, or share something with you. The more open you are with them, the more likely they will be to confide in you rather than keep it hidden away.,Men just find it harder in general to talk about anything (apart from sport!). That’s probably one of the reasons I would suggest not over-thinking it or trying to act out of character. Just be yourself, let them know you are there for them and spend time doing fun, light-hearted mate things. Sometimes it’s not about talking about problems, sometimes it’s about having a way of not having to talk about them."
,"I have anxiety and depression. I also suffer from panic attacks. It makes life so hard on a daily basis, everything I seem to worry and panic about, literally everything. Going out and socialising, I can't do much because of my anxiety. It sucks having both of them because most of the times they just come together and make your day even worse. I used to be very much high functioning, but for some reason that I've not found out yet, I just all of a sudden dropped, and the high functioning person I used to be had just disappeared.,The stigma and silence of mental health had a huge impact on me. It was such a big impact, that I didn't even tell anyone or go to my GP until late last year, it took me four years. I just always thought, because of the stigma, that it wasn't a serious problem, and I wouldn't get took seriously by my GP. I didn't have someone to talk to about my mental health issues until last year when I got in contact with a good friend, that's when I found out, that I couldn't really go on without telling a professional.,It was hard without having someone who understood mental health, but it was much easier when I spoke about it, to my friend who did understand what I was going through. She was the one who told me to seek help, which I did. Our friendship was really strong, she helped me so much, she always used to ask ""how are you?"" ""are you doing okay today?"" ""do you need someone to go with you?"" and it meant a lot, especially her asking me if I want her to come with me to anywhere I want to go, really helps me, especially with my social anxiety.,Talking to someone or just being there for someone is really important. Not many people realise or know how important and how much it helps until they've experienced someone talking to them when nobody has before. I understand how hard it is to suffer in silence, so I try my best to be in all of my friends' corners, and when they need to talk to someone that I am there, talking to them. ,Many people don't understand mental health, and therefore, their attitude towards it can be awful. The stigma that is attached to mental illness is so strong; it makes it so much harder to actually be able to speak out. However, I feel like people's attitudes are changing, solely because mental illness is getting the publicity it deserves, many people are going on TVshows like This Morning, and sharing their stories about their struggles, which helps to stop the stigma and the awful attitude around mental illness."
"Lauren, ","What happens if your friend stops texting you back? No longer seems interested when you suggest a night out? It’s so easy to automatically assume that perhaps they’re losing interest in your friendship. Sometimes, the reality can be that they are facing a daily battle with their own mind. Mental illness comes in different forms but no matter the problem, it can become awfully debilitating for those suffering. Getting out of bed, if achieved at all, can feel like an uphill battle. Everyday tasks which are usually done without batting an eyelid become more and more difficult to manage.,It can be difficult to know what to do, or what to say, if you have a friend who is going through a difficult time. You don’t want to slip up for fear of saying the wrong thing or feel as though you’re being insensitive to their feelings. It can be an incredibly isolating place, so first and foremost, acknowledging that you are there for them and ready to listen whenever they want to talk, is a great start. Some of what they say may be difficult to understand, but try to keep an open mind and offer a non-judgemental approach. What’s important to remember is that some days they might not feel up to meeting up. Recognise that this is nothing to do with you, they might just be having a bad day and need some time alone. Send a simple text to let them know that you’re there and ready to organise something at a later date.,I’ve been mostly lucky with the people in my life who have been understanding and helpful at a time when I needed them most. When I became , after the end of a relationship, my friends were extremely considerate. It happened at a time when one of my good friends was travelling around Australia. She was having these amazing experiences yet still found the time to be there for me. My , worsened at night and I often struggled to sleep. Of course, it was the middle of the night in the UK but the middle of the day in Australia. She was always there, at the other end of the phone, sending me words of encouragement. I don’t think she realised just how much she was helping.,Yet, one bad experience with a person who I was particularly close to, affected me in a very big way. I try to focus on the positives as much as possible, but I think it’s important to recognise the profound impact that this negative experience had on me. I never want someone to feel the guilt and shame that I did about not being okay. Looking back, I couldn’t believe that I had found the strength to open-up and didn’t get the response I so desperately craved. You want to believe that the ones you care about the most are standing ,.,You see, mental illness is not a choice. In the same way that you can break your arm, you can become depressed. It can seemingly come out of nowhere and leaves you feeling extremely vulnerable. To understand how to cope with a friend’s illness, empathy is key. Even if it’s difficult to understand fully, being there for a loved one and letting them know you’re not going anywhere, makes the world of difference. They are still your friend, but one who is going through a particularly difficult time. Life is always going to have its ups and downs. Friendship is about supporting those you care about, through the good and the bad, no matter what. "
,"Over the last 4 years I have had two episodes of clinical ,. In August last year I was admitted for 4 weeks to an inpatient unit due to the seriousness of my symptoms. The reason I want to share this is that it’s so important that we feel able to talk to our managers and colleges about our mental well being without fear of being viewed as somehow “not able to cope” or in some way incapable.,A conservative estimate is that 1 in 4 of us will experience a mental health problem in our lives, so the chances are that all of us will either experience one ourselves or have a loved one who will.,I myself have worked for Social Services for the last 21 years, initially as a support worker in a Community Mental Health Team. After I was fortunate enough to be seconded on an employment based Masters Degree course in Social Policy, I then stayed at the CMHT as a qualified Social Worker, and then as an Approved Social Worker where I was responsible for using the Mental Health Act to help clients who needed assessment to consider whether admission to hospital was required to support them and keep them safe. I eventually became manager of the team, and then moved on to Safeguarding work and more recently I have been working in the Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards team.,I’ve been back at work since mid January and am pleased to say that my recovery has gone really well since Christmas. The support I received from the mental health services both in the community and in hospital was outstanding, and I continue to benefit from the skilled support from the community team.,My , were and are central to my recovery, and having a wonderful wife, two lovely daughters, supportive and loving parents and siblings made all the difference in helping me to hold onto what really matters. I also know that without the love and friendship from my mates I don’t think my family and I would have come through this.,My close friends (and I’m so lucky to have some) were amazing at keeping in touch with me whilst I was in hospital. I couldn’t bring myself to see many of them, as I was so low and my self esteem so shot, that I didn’t feel I deserved their friendship. Consequently I only really felt able to see my brother and oldest friend whilst I was in hospital. They took turns visiting along with my wife and set up a rota so I had regular visits, and I gradually became able to have some leave with their support. This was central to my recovery, as were the ongoing texts and calls from friends and colleges who , even though my responses were brief. They tolerated the long pauses over the phone, or delayed responses to their texts encouraging me to hang in there, and reminding me of the person that I really was when I was not so unwell.,When I did get discharged I continued to struggle with a very low mood, but again my friends kept getting in touch. Another old mate who was temporarily between jobs made a point of coming over and taking me out for walks with his dog. Stomping through the bridle paths of Surrey in the freezing cold, doing his best at speaking for both of us as I struggled to get more than two words out whilst I just despaired of ever being “me” again or ever being able to work again.,From October until past Christmas, I remained much the same, and then in the New Year I started to feel better, and for a number of reasons, I started to feel like myself again. I believe it was a combination of medication, Acceptance Commitment Therapy and having been able to spend time with my family and friends over the holidays, that somehow led me to feel OK or acceptable as opposed to feeling racked with guilt for the four months that had preceded this.,I also know that it was the tireless dedication of my mates and family that helped pull me back to my feet again.,I’ve been back at work since mid January and continue to be supported by the Community Mental Health Team. I plan to stay well and I’m developing a Wellness Recovery Action Plan, so I’ll be better prepared in case I experience another episode, in the hope that I can recognise the symptoms earlier and take action to avoid becoming so unwell again.,I’m aware that it seems to be every 4 years that this happens to me, so I’m a little bit nervous about the Tokyo Olympics’ in 2020, but I’m hopeful that I will be able to enjoy watching them a bit more than I did for RIO 2016.,If you know someone who's struggling or is acting differently – be a friend to them. Reach out. Trust me, it will make a difference."
,"If I didn't have my friends I wouldn't be as happy as I am now. In my darkest moments, they support me. When I feel like there is no light, they switch it on. When my thoughts are drowning me, they give me a new perspective. When I feel like a failure, they remind me of my worth. At every single point of my journey through life, they celebrate my achievements and my happiness, and they support me through despair. They make sure I never feel alone. They never pretended to know the answers.,They can't fix me. But they helped me to realise that I don't need to be fixed. They have always told me that as a person I am wonderful, it’s just that my illness makes me think differently. Nothing changed when I told them about my mental health problems. They knew that I am the same person and the only difference is that they supported me more.,When I told my friend Carys that I was hearing voices, she was literally the only person in high school that didn't freak out or run away. I remember once in a science lesson, was hearing voices and feeling distressed, she actually left her lesson to get me from mine. We got in a bit of trouble, but it meant the world to me that she was there for me. A lot of people tell me they’re here for me, but they don't respond when I’m down. Carys is one of the people who does.,Matt is the same. We became friends when we were at college, and a lot of the time I was quiet, or irritable, and my mood swings are always very intense, but he was patient and listened when I needed to rant about life.,They always tell me I can talk to them anytime I need. Carys picks up the phone at literally any time of the day. We could sometimes go weeks without talking if we’re both busy, but whenever I say I need her, she is there straight away without hesitation. She came to my appointments with me, she visited me in hospital and she would come to my house and cook my favourite things.,Sometimes, if I’m having a bad night, I can message Matt hundreds of times, and he always takes the time to read every message and reply to me. Whenever he knows I’m having a hard time and we meet up, he brings me a Diet Coke as well, and that is awesome!,They both know that one of my favourite quotes is ""this too shall pass"", and whenever I’m struggling, they remind me to tell myself that ""this too shall pass"". They always invite me out, even when the whole time I sit silently because I’m hearing voices or leave early because I’m so anxious, they always invite me to the next meet-up, party or meal out.,The best thing they do though, is they make me laugh. When I phone Carys and I’m upset, we talk about it, and then she makes me laugh by reminding me of a funny moment, or telling me something cute that her daughter Elsie is doing, so by the time we finish the phone call I’m smiling. Whenever I call matt and I’m upset, we talk about it, then he makes me laugh by making a stupid face, speaking in a weird voice or telling an awful joke. It makes such a difference to have friends who’re always in your corner.,If you are worried about your friends’ mental health, talk to them. You don't need to put on a show, or buy them something expensive – your friendship is what they need. The little things make the biggest difference, like tagging them in a funny meme, sending them a GIF, buying them their favourite drink, inviting them out, texting them if you notice they haven't been at school/college/work. The little things are what remind people that they aren't alone."
,"It's all about people isn't it?  Life that is.  As we look back on our happiest memories for the most part it's the people that shared those moments with us that made them so special; it's people that add the colour and character to life's precious moments.,It's people that can make the biggest difference to us when life reveals its darker side, when we grieve and when we hurt.  And it's the people that share with us our tears as well as our laughter that we hold dearest to us.,I've seen life's darker side.  Having suffered with crippling bouts of depression in both 2006 and 2013 I've wondered whether the darkness would ever lift, whether moments of laughter would ever visit my door again, whether the 'me' that I once knew would ever find his way back.,The 'me' that I had been was gone, replaced by a broken shell of what once was, a mass of pain and despair; of fear, terrible fear of what would become of me and who would still be there at the end of it, if indeed an end would come.,But they were there.  My oldest friends were there for me throughout, and I'll never, ever forget that and I can never thank them enough.,Craig, my oldest friend who I met at nursery and who has been there to listen ever since, to pick me up when I've been let down and disappointed, when I've been dumped, when I've been angry, when I've been dumped, when I've been hurt, when I've been dumped (you get the picture).  He was there for me as my Best Man on my wedding day; he was also there when I wondered how I could face another day, when getting out of bed was the limit of my achievements, when the chatty, fun Matthew was replaced by one for whom smiling was an impossibility.,He was there, every week to take me out and just be there, reminding me of who I really was beneath the illness and letting me know that somebody believed in me, and that however bad things were I could count on him being in my corner.,Simon, my friend since I asked him whether he was a boy or a girl on our first day of primary school.  A man so popular it's only a matter of time before he has a lounge named after him in his local (or a poker table at least); a friend that at times over the years I've lost touch with as our lives took us in different directions and to different places, but who I am always able to pick up with as if we'd never been away.  The friend that took me out to play darts every week during my second illness even though his Dad was terminally ill.  At a time when others less understanding could have - and maybe would have - thought, 'What have YOU got to be depressed about?', he was there, giving me brief respite from my waking nightmare whilst reminding me that 'trebles are for show but doubles are for dough.',It's hard to overstate just how much their support meant to me.  One thing that mental illness teaches you (or taught me at least) is just how much inner strength and resource you have, but in the midst of it nothing could seem further from the truth.,Between them, my friends reminded me that my illness wasn't me, that I had a lot to offer and would one day be me again, and that just for an hour or two I could escape from my broken mind and focus on the 'now' of a pub quiz or throwing a dart.  Whilst being able to recognise this at the time it is only from the promised land of recovery that I can truly appreciate just how much of a difference their support made to me, how much it helped me in a recovery that at the time didn't seem possible.,There is so much stigma and misunderstanding that surrounds mental illness and this is acutely felt when you are surrounded by its fog.  For men in particular it can be difficult to admit to, when 'being a man' is associated with being strong and tough and not admitting to needing help from anybody, from putting a shelf up to admitting that your life is falling apart around you and that you're scared and you can't cope.,Sometimes we can't admit this to ourselves, but what we can all do is look out for our friends and be there for them when they are struggling, to notice when they're not quite themselves and could use a mate in their corner.  We don't need to understand mental illness to do this, we just need to understand that our friend needs to know we're there for them, whether to talk, to listen, to tell bad jokes or to give them an affectionate punch on the arm.,Some people claim not to believe in mental illness; well, millions of people do believe in Santa Claus and the Tooth Fairy but their belief doesn't make them real.  Similarly, not believing in mental illness doesn't make it not real, it IS real, and it can strike anybody at anytime; believe me, if it happens to you you will KNOW that it is real, and you will be left in no doubt that you are very ill and that you can't get through it alone.  Nobody chooses mental illness, and from experience I can honestly say I wouldn't wish it on anybody.,But like most difficulties in life it teaches us things too, and one of the biggest lessons you learn is who is there for you when you most need them to be.,We can all be that friend.,Be in your mate's corner, you may never know just how much difference it could make."
,"Judging others because of their illnesses, and without knowing, or caring, about their stories, will cause pain. I know from experience that poor attitudes can cause untold damage.,To give you my background, I am the victim of abuse and rape, and when I use the word victim I mean in the legal sense. I have always been vulnerable and even as an adult I was taken advantage of by a predatory man who saw my vulnerability, groomed me, and raped me. I currently have the following diagnoses: complex ,, , and a history of , and ,, including ,. ,Discrimination has seriously affected me in different ways. Firstly, my abusive family conditioned me to believe that I was ‘mental’ because I was diagnosed with depression and that the mental health services would hurt me – that was their threat that left me in fear since I was a teenager. I am now in my mid-twenties, and it has taken me the past two years to build up the courage to ask for help when I realised what was happening to me. However, this did not happen easily, rather through extreme cries for help.,I was diagnosed with the PTSD and BPD only recently because of my reluctance to open up to the mental health services – since I was so afraid of them and did not want to be labelled. I have been put on medication which I did not like because I believed it would label me as ‘weak’ and ‘mental’, which of course is not true, but is what I believed for so many years that it was difficult to shift my own attitude and undo the damage of abusive people's attitudes. ,I was up against the abusive family’s attitudes and behaviour towards mental health, and now that I’m away from them, I’ve come up against more appalling situations. Not just by anyone, but people who are supposed to be trained and have knowledge of mental health disorders, and in caring contexts like in hospitals and communities.,Since my BPD diagnosis, I have asked for help more help to access to services and understanding my condition. I started using helplines to test my confidence with people when I am talking about such dark things, which was usually OK apart from one incident... I had called a helpline to say that I felt impulsive and wanted to harm myself (but instead tried to help myself by having someone to reassure me that things would be OK). The adviser questioned me saying ‘how can you be impulsive if you haven’t done anything yet?’ I tried to explain to him it was how my BPD affects me, but he said in a very nasty way that ‘you can’t keep using your BPD as an excuse to behave this way, you need to take responsibility’.,Of course, I had called because I felt low and impulsive and was met with judgement, confrontation, and lack of compassion. I had reached out for help. But I was met with yet more disappointment, which only lowered my trust in services even further. In the end, I put in a complaint about this and it was dealt with in a very professional manner, which reassured me that I could call again.,I’ve also had a few bad experiences with Community Psychiatric Nurses. I was in self-destruct mode one night and had a little to drink to try and cope with my overwhelming feelings of despair. I called the CPN helpline, but as soon as I mentioned it they told me ‘there is nothing we can do to help you, don’t drink and maybe things won’t be so difficult’ and abruptly hung up the phone. I am not a drinker – it was an unhealthy coping strategy during this time and as you can see I wasn’t even given the opportunity to speak. I was utterly shocked and in more despair. She dismissed me without any knowledge of my situation, without any understanding or empathy. ,These are just a few of the awful experiences I have gone through, but there is hope. Some lovely professionals out there have made me feel like I am a person, and not someone characterised and defined by mental illness. I have been treated with respect and dignity, after telling them how one little word can trigger a whole lot of things which can lead to self-destruction. I have come to learn that when you know what your own needs are and can express these clearly to those who are there to help, you most likely will get that help.,But many people really need to change their attitudes towards mental health. These , prevent people from asking for help because they think they are most likely going to be judged, dismissed, told to ‘get on with it’. We need more understanding of the hidden issues so that people provide better services, promote confidence in those with illness to approach services, to avoid misunderstandings when it comes to peoples’ behaviour (that they have a mental illness which is not in their control) so they do not end up in the criminal justice system or otherwise unsupported. It should not be acceptable to treat , in such uncaring ways – it should not be the norm.,I have realised that some people just do not understand what they haven’t been through. I don’t take it so personally anymore, so I am not as defensive. Those who make it difficult and make you feel belittled, and minimise your condition/illness, do it because they do not understand and become frustrated. I think it is all about educating those people so that there are less misunderstandings and more help available without barriers. Most importantly, people need to know that a little understanding goes a long way. "
,"I first experienced mental health problems at age nine, but I didn’t really know what was happening. , just thought I was scared of everything and that I was a nervous little girl. At around the age of 14 I went to see a young person’s counsellor because my ,had got worse. I’d got to the point where I couldn’t sleep alone any more – I had to share a room with my sister.,It wasn’t until university that I got a formal diagnosis of ,. At the time I didn’t tell anyone because I was embarrassed. Anyone that knew me would never guess there was anything wrong because I was so good at hiding it. On the outside I was outgoing and friendly – but on the inside it was a very different story.,It’s taken me a long time to feel comfortable talking to people about my experience – I’m 28 now, and I’ve only just told my best friend about my experience of depression and anxiety. Even though there are more people talking about mental health these days, I’m still afraid of people judging me. Also, coming from an African Caribbean background, people have this expectation that I’ll be a strong, confident woman, which I am. But I also have a mental health problem, and for some people those two things can’t exist at the same time.,I’m getting more confident ,: I decided to film different people with mental health problems talking about their story, including myself. It was screened at a cinema, and some of my colleagues saw it. Since then some of them have come up to me at work and shared their own experiences of it. , has been supportive and given me time to go and speak about mental health in schools. I know that not everyone is so lucky. , But there are some people, like my family, I’m still not comfortable talking to. My dad has had difficulty understanding, it’s not in a nasty way; he just doesn’t ‘get it’. I do try to explain but in the end I don’t want to feel like a burden. If I keep talking about how I feel, I sense people losing patience with me – they don’t know that I can’t just snap out of it. If I could, I would!,I think part of this ignorance is down to the fact we aren’t always educated about mental health in school, and because many people base their understanding on ,. Portrayals and documentaries on TV always show someone at their worst, when they’re really at rock bottom. I feel like you never see anyone like me, who does cope day-to-day and has a job and socialises – basically someone who leads a normal life but happens to have a mental health problem.,We all need to do a better job of opening up to mental health - of showing people that it comes in different shapes and sizes, that there is no one stereotype that fits every person with a mental health problem. And we need to extend patience and understanding to people with mental health problems, not expecting that they will get better straight away but listening and accepting without judgement.,Follow Katherine on Twitter at ,  "
,"I'm Della, I live in a house share in a different town from my family, I work full time and I have to get through all my daily chores alone and ploughing through the darkness of depression. It's hard, really hard.,Depression doesn't care if I have to get up early and work a nine hour shift, depression doesn't care if I need to get into town to do some basic shopping, depression doesn't care if I've made arrangements with friends. I can be perfectly happy one day and wake up the next day with the dark sadness and suicidal thoughts, there is no warning and there's no way to stop it.,Having been living with depression for years, I take daily medication and I attend regular GP appointments and counselling but none of that can stop depression. The hardest part for me to handle is how it affects my work, I love my job and the routine of going to work every day, being surrounded by the staff who are loving and supportive is the best feeling, but when depression is hovering I can't deal with work, all I want to do is sit and cry and feel sorry for myself. I need a routine to keep myself focused, of my routine changes it can take me long time to adjust and I know it will have an impact on my mental wellbeing. When depression visits me, I struggle to work, I don't eat well, I self harm and I have thoughts about ending my life.,It's a scary place and although I have the support of friends and family I tend to push them away, I don't know why, maybe it's the thoughts I have and the shame I feel that I can't control my own mind. I'll be honest I've lost friends, I've nearly lost family in the past when my mental illness got the better of me and I tried to end my life. None of that matters now, I'm just coming out of a depression episode and as hard as it was I'm still learning about my mental health and so are my family and friends, I'm blessed to have the ones who have stuck by my side, who bring me chocolate when I'm sad or sit in A&E with me when I'm at a low point.,I'm tired of hiding my thoughts and hiding my self harm, if I'm in a low point I want to be able to tell everyone close so they know I'm not just being miserable, unsociable or boring but because I'm dying inside. I used to hide my mental illness, I hide from my ex boyfriend for a long time, too long. I was ashamed and I honestly thought I couldn't be loved. I hated myself, I still do at times so why would anyone chose to love me. It wasn't until things got particularly bad that he found out, I guess it's thanks to him I'm so open about it now. He was amazing and supportive and for once I didn't feel alone. I had someone by my side who was listening to me and didn't judge me. "
,"As a man, admitting to having a mental illness is still seen as a 'weakness'. The ,still remains. This week, a post I made on Twitter regarding ,(#anxietyepidemic), received a lot of feedback, including from men who engaged in the conversation. This has encouraged me to write further about my own experiences, and hopefully help men to talk.,My story in short, is one of ,and crippling anxiety, which began in my early 20's. After years of partying, drinking and basically eating rubbish, I piled on the weight. My self-esteem plummeted, which in turn fuelled my growing mental health issues. My anxiety was so bad at one point; even travelling on public transport was a challenge. I knew I needed to seek help and was placed onto a distance-based CBT programme via my GP. Combined with improving my diet and exercising; my condition improved, but never went away.,9 years later, I sit here knowing my depression and anxiety issues will probably never leave me. Some days I wake up and feel like I do not want to get out of bed. The mental strength I use to drag myself up to face the day can be exhausting. On such occasions, I am noticeably quieter. Sat trying to put a front on, and function as a 'normal' member of society, when all I want to do is shut myself away and sleep, can be draining and frustrating at the same time. The days when I feel good, I feel like I can conquer anything. The days when I feel low, I feel like the most abject failure this world has ever produced.,Anxiety can manifest itself to me in various forms, be it generalised, health or social. The panic attacks I suffer when my heart beats a little funny or when I find a random lump which turns out to be nothing, can be debilitating. Every headache is a stroke, every ache is cancer. I laugh at myself when not in the moment anxiety has me gripped.,My social life has certainly suffered, where years of closing myself off from friends and the outside world has resulted in lost connections. Most people probably thought I was just ignorant or uninterested, when the reality is whilst I wanted to socialise; my social anxiety prevented me from doing so.,In 2016, after being made redundant, I was unashamed to admit that I needed help again; and talking with a therapist was such a helpful process for me. However, not many people know of my struggles. ,. I mentioned to an ,once I was having a bad period of depression, which was why my performance had dropped slightly. This was met with the supportive comment of, ""if I had known you had depression when we employed you, I wouldn't have'. No wonder people, male or female, feel like they can't speak up about their struggles., Just this week, I have been the subject of what society feels a man should be. A jovial dig about me not being a 'real man' because I have never put up some shelves got me thinking … I would happily describe myself as a thinker, a dreamer, someone who is more at home reading political blogs and football analysis than fixing a car or putting up shelves. I don't go to the gym (I prefer running); don't have bulging biceps and these days, barely even drink. But why does any of this make me less of a man?,This all feeds into the 'weakness' stigma of mental health. If I broke my leg, would I be less of a man? No. I am the same person, just wearing a bandage. Ditto my anxiety, which is just an illness which affects my brain.,I am so scared of others reading this (thanks society), but I feel it is important for other men to know that they are not alone. There must be so many men who are scared to admit they have a problem, because they don't want to be seen as weak, to the point where some feel their only option is to die. This has to stop.,My name is Adam. I have mild depression and utterly frustrating anxiety. So what? I’m no less of a man."
,"Head Girl. High achiever. Destined for Oxford.,
These were all labels that were attached to my student identity by my (highly academic, all-girls) school in the autumn of 2015.,
What the school didn't know? That I was experiencing extreme depression and anxiety.,
After years of experiencing recurrent depressive episodes and relentless anxiety, I had internalised the nuggets of stigmatising 'advice' and 'encouragement' I had been fed over the years, such as: 'It's only hormones!' 'What do you have to be sad about, you're clever?' and 'You'll grow out of it.',
By the time I was 17, then, I had become a highly introverted, ashamed and mute sufferer of mental health problems. This did nothing to complement my role as Head Girl, as I had become obsessed with fulfilling my conception of the strong, inspiring female role model that the younger students would idolise, in which 'mentally ill' had no room in its formula. I was extremely reluctant to talk about, let alone seek help, for what I was experiencing, believing that if I accepted that I had a problem I was weak and, essentially, worthless.,
My form tutor at school could see that something deep was troubling me, and repeatedly asked if I was okay, to which I would employ a series of rehearsed excuses such as 'I'm just tired!' or 'just feeling a little stressed' so that I wouldn't have to accept or reveal what I was experiencing and how I was feeling.,
(The fact that people have to make up excuses for their mental health due to shame, embarrassment or fear is yet another indicator of the stigma surrounding mental illness.),
My form tutor, after detecting that I wasn't well, was the , to tell me that having a mental illness ,. She told me that if anything, I was a more realistic role model to the girls junior to me at school through being human, and that's what our struggles do - ,This was the first time in years that a) I had been spoken to directly about my poor mental health and, most importantly, b) ,
It was my form tutor's words of strength and caring words of encouragement that gave me a voice, both to speak up about my problems and become a mouthpiece for challenging stigma for others. If it wasn't for this conversation, I would never have started the road to recovery and be where I am now: in a place of unashamed honesty. If it wasn't for this conversation, I would not have pursued my passions of campaigning to reduce stigma.,
Recovery is a very lengthy, continuous process, but without this conversation I would not have taken the first step towards a great future. Through listening and caring, and speaking kind and informed words, , have the power to give somebody their worth back and allow them to live the life that they deserve, free from the burden of a self-stigmatising view.,
You don't have to be an expert to talk about mental health - you just have to care."
,"I kept my mental health issues secret from everyone I knew for ten months. It was a mental problem, but I could feel the weight of that problem physically weighing me down every single day.,Contemplating ,, alone, as a 20-year old who was meant to be out enjoying the “best years of his life”, was an incredibly difficult thing to have to wake up to and think about everyday.,But, a few conversations truly saved my life. I can put it down to three key conversations; a conversation with my ,I was kind of forced into having a conversation with my ex-girlfriend, who also forced me to have a conversation with my parents, who then got me in touch with the family friend. I was angry at the time with everyone getting involved, but knowing what I know now, I wish I’d had that first conversation with someone ten months earlier.,Now, am I going to sit here and say that my parents, my ex-girlfriend, or even myself had an easy conversation where everything was understood quickly, and we solved the problem just like that?,Of course not, and it was a difficult time for all of us trying to figure out what was happening inside my head. But, in time, we all came to learn just how powerful a conversation or a few words can be.,My parents quickly learnt that what they thought may have been throwaway, helpful statements like “it’s just in your head” can cripple a depressed person. But without researching and talking about these things together, we never would have found the right approach to tackling my black dog.,Our conversations started off tough and awkward, and I avoided them at all costs to be honest. When I first started therapy, I hated talking about how I was doing, because I wasn’t doing any better and I couldn’t bear to let them know that.,But I started to get better, and our conversations changed. They became positive and inspiring, and we all felt hopeful enough to start talking about the future again – something I’d missed doing for so long.,Then I started to look forward to these conversations, and they’d become a centrepiece of my days, by which point I’d broadened out to tell my closest friends as well. I now had a network that I’d created of family, friends, and therapists who were constantly checking in with me, and together we were all getting through it.,These conversations became my absolute bedrock. These people were there for me when I finally started laughing again, but they were also there for me when I’d give up all hope again the next week.,I knew I could tell them the crazy things that were happening in my head, and we could laugh about it or cry about it, whatever it may be. But, most importantly, we could plan how to tackle it.,And now? Well now, I’m fully recovered, and a huge piece of that is down to the conversations that I had with people that I’ll always be eternally grateful to.,They still try and have these conversations with me sometimes by asking “and how have you been doing mentally recently?” and it always makes me smile knowing I can now have a laugh with them saying “I’m fine…well, that was a weird period aye?”,I may be able to laugh about it now, but that all started from a couple of tough, difficult, awkward conversations that I was forced to have. But I’ll always be grateful for that first conversation because there’s no doubt that it saved my life.,Great work is being done to have people , and to save lives, such as with the new Heads Together campaign set up by the royal family. But still, we need to have these conversations on a bigger scale.,This isn’t such a commonly known fact, but suicide is the UK’s single biggest killer of men under the age of 45. These conversations are now more important than ever. Put Trump's hair and the Kardashians to one side for a minute and have a conversation that really matters.,If you’re struggling, man or woman, and don’t know where to turn, just open up to someone. Friends, family, me, a therapist, or online forums such as Elefriends.,If you know someone who may be struggling or someone that has opened up to you, be understanding and be kind. Research around to find out what might be happening and know that they aren’t currently seeing the world as you do, so choose your words carefully. But with your help, they’ll be able to pull through, and that’ll be one of the greatest things you’ll ever do in your life.,Why have that conversation? Because conversations change lives. Wherever you are, whatever the time, have that conversation that could save someone’s life."
"Danny, ","The guy in the photo, yes, the one who’s smiling back at you looking like he has no cares in the world, that’s me. I was inspired to share this picture after reading an excellent blog which deeply connected with me, written by Lily and entitled ‘,’, where she highlights just how looks can be deceiving. If you don’t usually follow these blogs, or haven’t had a chance to read Lily’s, then I highly recommend taking the time.,Reading Lily’s blog post gave me the courage to tell my story. A story which I am very much still in the middle of. Behind that happy-go-lucky smile is a darkness that I have kept hidden from most. Looking back on my childhood and adolescence I can now see the signs that I didn’t understand. It was not until I reached university that I began to realise the full extent to which ,, and later ,, was shaping my life, but it was in my fourth year, when studying at Master’s level, that I had a full-scale breakdown. Ironically, I study Psychology, and contrary to popular belief, this doesn’t help when suffering from mental illness. The day this happened I thought I was done – I was through with University, through with the effort it took to get through every day, through with life. A then 22-year-old man who studied Psychology – how could he possibly suffer from mental health problems?,However, I was lucky, and still am, to have extremely supportive ,, without who I wouldn’t be where I am today – a final year Psychology PhD student. For me, I am learning to accept that I suffer from anxiety and depression and although this is a part of who I am, I am also learning that it doesn’t have to be me, or define who I am. I use the term learning, because that’s just it, you learn and grow. Anxiety isn’t something you can just switch off and forget about, you learn to cope with it. My daily life is still very much a rollercoaster, I can feel on top of the world one moment, and the slightest thing, which may seem insignificant to some, will knock me back. Some days are light and some are so dark they don’t bear thinking about. I am still on my recovery path; these things take time. I am learning to accept that I am not a bad person or a ‘loser’, and most importantly, I am not weak, and neither is anyone else who suffers with their mental health.,People often fail to realise that we all have mental health. Still, many don’t ,t. It is, in fact, just as important as our physical health, if not more so. Mental health can cause physical illness.,I am now 26 and I still find it hard to discuss…partly because I am within this bubble myself, and partly because I can never be sure how other individuals will react. This itself is a massive obstacle to overcome as it only serves to induce yet further feelings of isolation. The longing to be normal and to fit in. I have also heard the classic lines…small words which can have a lasting and severe impact. “Man up”. “Grow up”. “Pull yourself together”. “Get over it”. Words that all indicate a very poor understanding of mental health, but leave you feeling more isolated, more alone, and, if possible, with less self-esteem than you had before. That you are the problem; but this is not true.,I am lucky to have such supportive parents, and one particular friend who has stood by me throughout, steering me in the right direction and not being afraid to let me talk. Sometimes I lash out, sometimes I get angry, but usually these are linked to the fear of being alone, and these people understand that, for which I am forever grateful. They understand that the last thing I ever want to do is cause upset or hurt, and that the thought of doing so is cataclysmic to me.,Being able to talk openly is a blessing. It is not always easy or possible but is one of the only things that will help end the stigma around mental health, and inevitably make the road to recovery a little easier. Very few people know my story, and yes, this is just a small portion of it. For me it was a big step in recovery to talk so publicly, but I hope I can inspire others like Lily inspired me.,Remember, the smallest words and actions can make the biggest difference – both positive and negative. Be kind, open and honest. Help end the stigma surrounding mental health."

,"Depression... Reading that word made you feel a bit uncomfortable, right? Almost as if it is a bad word we shouldn’t use in our normal vocabulary. I get it, the idea of mental illness is frightening so the easiest way to deal with it is, well, to avoid it.,Living with mental illness is terrifying, tiring and consuming. Without even realizing, it takes over your entire body and you are left with no control or strength to fight it. The world around you is silent but the brain in your head is running a marathon backwards. Everything becomes dark - the sky, the sun, the clouds and you. There’s no turning back, and for some twisted reason, you don’t want to turn back. The darkness has become home. It’s safe.,My mental illness most likely began when I was in grammar school, we just never caught it. Looking back at it now, I see clearer reasoning behind all the countless absences and breakdowns. When you’re that young, no one expects a child to be depressed or have anxiety like that.,I agree, it is a scary thought to consider a 4th grader may be battling depression. The first time a doctor told me I was depressed, I was in high school and even then I refused to believe it because I was afraid of what it meant.,""Depression,"" that oh-so-scary word. How could that be me? I fought the truth for a long time. It took a couple of years of worsening depression and severe anxiety for me to finally let myself accept the help I needed.,What scared me the most was the idea of medication. I didn’t want a pill giving me fake happiness. Even though I was hesitant, I decided to try it. I’ll be honest, it wasn’t easy. For a good six months, I felt like a lab rat trying all these different pills that didn’t seem to do a thing. Eventually I found the right one that does work for me.,Through all of this, I learned so much about myself and my body. Most importantly, I learned my mental illness does not define me by any means, Neither does my medication, for that matter. If anything, I’m stronger than I thought I could ever be because of it. I’m not a different person and my happiness isn’t fake.,I’m me.,I have never been one to openly discuss my mental illness. At first it was out of shame and because I didn’t want anyone worrying about me or treating me different. Until about a year ago, I was perfectly fine with keeping the messy details of my life to myself, my therapist, and the very few people I would let in.,It wasn’t until I attended, then led, a retreat called Kairos that I was able to fully open up about it and feel no shame whatsoever. In fact, I learned that my story was meant to be told because others who battle the same things need to know they are not alone. Since I made the choice to be open about my mental illness, I have made immense progress in battling it.,I don’t wish mental illness on anyone. It’s a trip to hell that takes a whole lot of fighting to get back home. Though I’m in a much better place than I once was, it can be easy to let the depression take over again. It is up to me to keep myself on track but it is also up to me to ask for help if need be.,Depression does not have to be scary. It needs to be talked about. Silence only makes it worse and I had to learn that the hard way. Now, I’m not saying to go around town with a sign that says “I have depression,” but I am saying to be aware of the people around you and most importantly the ones you love. It’s amazing how far a real “how are you?” can go."

Some days, everything can seem too much and it is very hard to do anything or socialise with people. It can be hard to convey this struggle to anyone who has not experienced problems with mental health.,But the symptoms are not the main discussion point for this blog. It's to show that anyone can experience mental health problems, that it is not something people should be ashamed or embarrassed about and talking about it is so much more beneficial than hiding it. 1 in 4 people suffer from mental health problems and every 1 in 10 suffer from mixed anxiety and depression (Mind, 2009) showing just how common it is and yet no one talks about it. The stigma attached to mental health is so negative and this should not be the case.,Most people are understanding of your struggles even if they do not understand the symptoms. Of course there are people out there that will say nothing is wrong with you but the people that matter the most will always be there to support you. Credit to my , who have just been there through my absolute toughest times even with limited experience of helping people with depression. Without them I would be in an extremely different position right now. It’s important to be open about mental health so people know how to help you as support is sometimes the most beneficial thing. Since I have opened up about my depression and anxiety, everyday life feels a lot more manageable as people close to me are aware of it and are understanding that some days it may take me a little longer to motivate myself to go somewhere or that things can become too much.,What I want most is to say mental health problems such as depression and anxiety should not just be ignored but should be openly discussed without stigma, awkwardness and embarrassment attached to it – even those who appear the happiest sometimes are struggling too. I hope this encourages people to talk and open up about their mental health as a benefit to themselves and to others around them."
," The confident and vibrant girl that I once was became no more. I fell into the trap of depression that seemed to have hit me overnight. I would usually be the one that always hid in the bathroom crying my eyes out and then wipe my own tears away only to walk out those doors like I have it all together. The young fifteen year old girl that I was at the time was drowned with anxiety, fear and a lack of something unknown. I was overwhelmed with the world and fell into exhaustion trying to act like I have it all together. The truth was that I was tired. Tired of trying to live like a ""normal person"", afraid that if I would be judged if I was honest about my feelings. I became sick of the fears that I had in my head, the ones that my mind was feeding me without any evidence.,In a room full of extroverts I felt like something was wrong with me. I would do nothing but question myself, asking: why am I feeling so nervous? Why do I always feel like everyone is watching and judging me? I always felt anxious whenever I spoke to someone, thinking they were out to get me.,I would avoid as many social situations and family events as much as possible because interacting with other people made me feel sick. My bedroom became my safe haven but depression seemed to have invited itself over the more I hid away. Graduating from school and moving on to college, life couldn't possibly get any worse. I enjoyed most of my classes but I always found it difficult to make and keep friendships. Lunchtimes became hours of loneliness spending it all by myself.,It's not that I didn't speak to anyone, but I was an awkward human being. Whenever someone from my class would ask if I wanted to sit with them and their group of friends for lunch, I would always come up with a thousand reasons why I couldn't and would then dismiss myself. The truth was that I wanted to have friends and have lots of them. I didn't know how to speak to people because I would run from it at any given time. I hated awkward situations though I was probably the main source of them. I also hate eating in front of people and if boys were in the group that would make it ten times more difficult for me.,Other people saw me as the 'shy girl' and always questioned why I was nervous or hid away, keeping to myself all the time. I couldn't be bothered to explain myself because the more I tried to, the more I felt like they still didn't fully understand. They only say ""don't be shy, we won't bite"" but for someone that has gone so many years constantly feeling anxious, it's not that easy to get over.,Today I write my own blog documenting my journey in the hopes that it can help someone else. I enjoy writing and it seems to me as a bold move. A bold move to write and let it be known on the web. It works for me but maybe not for everyone else and I'm ok with that. Creating a blog is a corner that I enjoy writing on, sharing my journey in the hopes to help others is something I will always be proud of."
,"I told my manager in my , that I was experiencing depression and that I was on medication which would affect my ability to do my job. He said he did not believe that my medication was effecting my performance, and that I was just not up to doing my job and I would be dismissed in three months time unless I improve. I really didn't know what to do or who to talk to as I have a lot of financial commitments. I had to take time off work as I couldn't face going back there following this.,I feel as if I have let myself down and my family in that I am not man enough to support them. It was really stressful over over the few weeks before, trying to decide to tell my manager what I was going through and now I wish I had not.,There are times when you feel helpless against the tide. I am lucky in that my , is extremely supportive and very, very kind. It’s just a shame that , cannot be seen in the same light as other illnesses. It is just as debilitating as having a broken bone only in this instance you have a broken spirit, an internal wound that will not heal and you have to go to extreme lengths to cover up and disguise...having to constantly have your guard up and having to constantly to put on a show of cheerfulness. If you let mask slip for a second you feel that it will fly away from your grasp and your will never be able to retrieve it again.,The physical effects of mental illness are punishing. The fatigue: if you sleep for ten hours you are still just as exhausted, you can’t concentrate and you are forgetful. It comes across as laziness and not caring at times but it is not. The medication causes massive weight gain and also plays havoc with your teeth. I grind my teeth at night as a result of , and they are beginning to break now – I swallow small chips every day and try to ignore it, and try to ignore the blood that comes when I brush my teeth. The doctor I see is wonderful but he is so overworked and there is so much pressure on him to care for so many people.,There is a lot in my job about mental health awareness but when it comes down to it there is nothing there really. I don't want to be treated any differently to my colleagues and I feel as if I do my work to a high degree. I just asked for him to be mindful for a while until I feel better. I have been advised to talk to people when you are feeling down, to tell your managers how you are feeling, but now I wish I never had. Things need to change."
", ","As Christmas approached I was reminded that it is nearly ten years since my father died. He died at home, body finally failing from gangrene, diabetes and decades of heart attacks and strokes. I was 27 and my mother and I had been his carers for 17 years. They were not pleasant years; he was manipulative and abusive and put us through hell.,His death freed me to face another issue, crippling ,, , and ,. I spiralled quickly downwards until I ended up on benefits, unable to leave the house, unable to operate as a human being. I went into counselling and fought back, faced the clichéd responses from people with no understanding of mental health. I was nothing but a lazy malingerer to them, a parasite that had to “get his finger out”, “pull himself up by his bootstraps”, get over himself, get out of the house and get a job. I had people say “give him to me and I’ll whip him into shape in a few days”.,I went through hell, again, not because an idiot told me to, but because I refused to let my life be defined by an illness. Years of deep counselling, every week, that would leave me shaking and sick to my core. After I broke down completely it took two and a half years of that before I could leave the house, but I eventually got two hours a week volunteering with a charity.,They were brilliant, understanding and supportive. Two and a half years later, I got a part time , with them, two years after that and I’m doing the job of the brilliant lady that I started volunteering for all those years before. I’ve been signed-off as no longer needing counselling, and I truly don’t. I have my own house, I can stand up in front of rooms full of people and deliver training to them without thinking twice about it. I have things that were impossible dreams ten years ago.,So why am I not happy? Well, it’s not all been plain sailing. My mother was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s last year and I faced the spectre of becoming a carer again. Thankfully I had support and help this time and managed to get her into supported housing where she’s really happy, but the last year has been as brutal in its own way as all the others.,But that’s behind me, there are no threats left. No stresses and strains. I should be happy. So why am I constantly fighting the return of depression? Why do I feel worse than I have in years?,I fear that my life has taken its toll. I fear that it has hollowed me out, and the scars it has left behind are so thick that I feel nothing. I don’t know how to live a normal life. I don’t understand ,. I feel things only when other people feel them and only feel alive when I can look at the world through their eyes, what was grey and irrelevant becomes vibrant and full of feeling, just because I’m with someone who sees it. If I’m alone I feel nothing and I fear that this makes me overbearing and hampers my ability to form relationships, because I crave that feeling of being alive more than anything else.,I have fought for decades. I have survived. And now, when I have achieved impossible things, I falter, because without the fight I have nothing left and nothing to live for. I did not expect to survive it and do not know what to do now that I have.,All I can say for sure is that other people matter. As much as I would have rejected that years ago I have to embrace it now. People saved my life, people have given me the foundation to fight back and people now give my life meaning. Their actions have an effect on how I feel, they can lift me up with common, everyday feelings that I can’t experience and light up my entire day, or they can sink me with a thoughtless word or careless action. While I struggle to find life and meaning, I find it in others and, very slowly, inch towards finding it in myself.,It’s a very vulnerable situation, but it is the situation I, and I’m guessing a lot of other people, are in. So please, be kind. Your words and actions can make or break someone fighting a battle that you likely can’t understand and, if you have a friend that’s annoyingly keen to spend time with you, please be patient. They may just be trying to live again."
,"At the age of twenty-two, after four years of my first identified episode of ,, I sit here with the realisation that although I haven't sank, I have merely been bobbing along through life – similar to a rubber duck on water. I’ve been staying afloat, and on the surface I am fine. But like the water in a storm, things can quickly change with an unexpected trigger. Negative thought patterns occur, feelings blur and in consequence emotions become uncontrollable. It is the first time since I was nineteen that I have gained clarity on my recovery journey so far; I have been using short term mechanisms to ‘cope’ when an episode occurs, but by no means have I found a long term ‘fix’ (if you can call it that?!).,Upon reflection I believe the delayed recognition of my depression and anxiety being as present, as it was four years ago in my everyday life, is due to the fact that I, myself, alongside many others, is still embarrassed to admit wholly, that I suffer from a Mental Health illness. I’ve tried to find ways of coping with my mental health through ‘acceptable’ ways. Some of which were, low levels of medication of Citalopram, 10mg. I ‘rationalised’ and told myself that I was taking this medication due to physical imbalance in the brain chemical of serotonin. I wasn't mad. I used self help books, such as Mark Williams & Danny Penman's ‘Finding peace in a frantic world’. I ‘rationalised’ and told myself everyone needs to find a little peace in such a ‘frantic’ and fast paced world we live in. I wasn't mad.,I was offered a course of CBT (Cognitive behavioural therapy), but declined, as I felt uncomfortable and almost ashamed to converse with complete strangers on a regular basis, and openly discuss all my inner struggles, emotions and anxieties. I didn't want my anxieties/emotions to be spoken about so openly, allowing for judgement, I didn't want to be labelled as mad.,I recognise now, that I was right, that I shouldn't have been labelled as mad, because I wasn't and I am not mad, but I have and still continue to suffer with a ‘Mental Illness’.,Its an illness that has been differentiated from a physical one, such as heart disease, epilepsy and asthma. Mental illness has a cemented , attached to it within society. It's a stigma that has prevented open talk, education, and aid. The attitudes within our society put physical illness above a mental illness; it's seen as more acceptable, it gains more support, sympathy and sensitivity from a variety of people. But most of all it's an illness that allows for the tools of recovery, with easily accessible support and treatments, at a faster and higher rate.,It's a common opinion that if your illness is physical and in some cases visible then it is real and an unfortunate but a real and merited situation. However, with mental illness, due to the lack of understanding or the inability to ‘rationalise’ the illness without visible facts, it often creates a label of ‘abnormality’ of a person, simply due to ignorance. So, why if our illness occurs in mind is it regarded as somewhat of a taboo to ,, whatever the aim of conversation? Is it simply due to people's perception of a physical illness being real and a mental illness not? Or is it due to the historic representation of the ‘mentally insane’? It's a question that can never be answered fully, but I, personally, can only assume that the miseducation of the past and present, has attached a label of abnormality to the illness.,With an ‘abnormal’ connotation attached to any action, thought, or emotion, the human psyche innately begins to feel, shame, embarrassment and guilt. It's a connotation that creates isolation for many people within society, preventing the ability to gain help, speak out and eventually make progress in their personal recovery. We’ve labelled and segregated people in need, we’ve made people feel that it's abnormal to be ill, we’ve made people feel ashamed to be the person they are. We’ve created demoralising and discriminatory attitudes towards a person in need, solely due to where the illness had a occurred in the body, an illness that has developed involuntarily. We need to educate ourselves and understand that it doesn't matter where biologically in the body an illness occurs, the effects on the soul are just as detrimental and damaging.,Throughout my own personal journey, I have held the negative attitudes and thoughts, I have inadvertently discriminated against my own mental illness. But, I have realised the damaging effects this has and can have on myself. I have realised I am a human, with thoughts, feeling and emotions, I'm not a robot. I have an illness, I am not the illness. And as with any illness, it is simply a glitch, a bump in the road, the wind in a storm. And as with any obstacle, you can overcome it, with the right tools, support and actions.,My mental health does not define me as a human, nor does it define you – it's simply one part of us, as an ordinary individual."
,"The first time I opened up to a friend about how I was diagnosed with depression, she said: ""how can you be depressed?"" It was a stab right through the heart - she didn't mean it in a nasty way, she was asking a simple question, but she sat glaring waiting for a reply and I couldn't answer. I seem to have everything: a husband who loves and cares for me,  a healthy little boy, who's smile brings so much joy, I have a house, a job, I go on nice holidays, I'm surrounded by so many people who love and care about me what more could anyone want? I get it, totally.,To my friend it’s like it wasn't acceptable to be sad, It's like because I had all these things my life wasn't bad enough to be depressing. But that’s not how depression works. The worst part was I felt I wasn't as lucky as everyone else I didn't have my health to enjoy all the things I was blessed to have, things that play a huge part in happiness.,It was like a Pandora's box had been opened with so many different emotions and I didn't know to deal with them, I felt like a burden to everyone around me I felt Like I was draining the life and happiness out of everyone exactly like my condition was doing to me, most days my heart didn't allow me to get up and go to work in the morning like everyone else did It didn't let me just be me, be a mum, I even thought at one stage life would be easier for everyone if I wasn't around if I packed a bag and ran away hopefully the sadness doll in my head wouldn't follow at the back I grow tiered of living in a body that's damaged and can't be repaired things I would normally carry in my stride I couldn't anymore, every difficult moment, anything that went wrong it,tore another huge chunk out of my sanity and it's like one day a light was switched off my legs gave way from underneath me and I fell into complete darkness alone.,With depression I always imagined someone looking sad and miserable someone who lay in bed and cried. I basically imagined the Sadness character from the film Inside Out: someone who's smart but pessimistic and negative all the time that the best and only thing to do in life is to lie around and cry.  That person wasn't me, In fact I rarely cried - it's like my tear ducts didn't work exactly like my heart didn't, I just felt numb, I didn't lie in bed crying every day. Instead I woke up in the morning just to go back to bed again at night - it's like there wasn't any purpose to life.,When I was diagnosed with depression, I couldn't accept it I didn't believe it, I felt sad but I used to think the sadness I felt was nothing compared to what depression feels like, I couldn't imagine what having Depression was like because it doesn't happen to people like me. Part of me even felt ashamed for feeling the way I did, it just sort of became a part of me, a part I didn't really like but I Just had to get along with anyway.,I've had people close to me suffer from lots of different mental health issues, I didn't judge them, I just felt compassion towards them and tried to help them. But I just couldn't see myself with depression. My Nana always used to say, your mind’s a powerful thing and that you shouldn't judge someone else's mind because you never really know what's going on inside it the ironic thing was the first time I witnessed mental health it was with her, she had bipolar that saying she always told me stuck, it made me compassionate to others Especially mental health, you don't judge someone’s mind when you don't understand what's going on inside it.,My own experience made me recognise depression has so many different faces and forms, mental health can affect anyone it doesn't matter if your fat or thin, rich or poor, it doesn't care if you’re male or female, it is what it is, it strikes without warning and takes over your life, You can't help the way you feel, you can't just snap out of being sad."
,"Normally stuff like this is written by a doctor or someone that has the ability to tell you with fancy words what anxiety and depression are, and how it affects one functionality to preform daily tasks.,So if that is what you are looking for you will be sadly disappointed. As this is not about the theory of it but the reality. I am just your regular and average guy who works a retail job that struggles to get by.,However, I believe that sitting here as I am writing this it will help myself and others deal with , and ,. Mental health issues are like the biggest black sheep in the world. But even though they may be the biggest, they are the hardest to see and to hear because they roar like a lion through the lives of millions. ,Ninety percent of us as humans, if we saw someone laying in the street holding their arm because they fell of their bike, or may have just missed the extra inch it took to step up onto the curb, would rush over to help them, assist them to the next steps of recovery. So why is it that when people are feeling alone, or they cry for no reason, or we see a decline in their personal happiness, we just stand by? We are all guilty of this, some not so much, but the same people who'd help the person with an injury we can see might not be the first to respond to a situation that is less obvious.,I guarantee that this applies to someone that you love, know as a neighbour, or a stranger that you sat next to on the bus, or the lady who was ahead of you in the grocery store. People are quick to judge and assume someone is weak because they seem like they have given up, or because they see all of the good in that persons life, which in turn causes anger because you'd think they be better.,We'll guess what? They do know all of this, they see it the same way we do. But when someone is battling with why they deserve to be on this earth, why they should get out of bed, or what's going to go wrong as soon as they open their eyes, they are now in defence/survival mode.,This may cause them to push all of those positives away. Including ,. I am not saying that when they do this it won't hurt your feelings because it sure as hell does. But we have to look past that, because if we drop our emotional hurt on them, that just gives them more to worry about. Which does not help the situation.,We need to let them know we are there for them. Help them with little things that may seem to be hard for them to accomplish such as dirty dishes that have piled up, laundry that needs to be done or put away.,These are things that they notice and will help take some stress away. Remember they are overwhelmed by EVERYTHING. They care about us, and love us but at the same time want to hide under their blankets. Lay in the dark and cry. You feel like it's so hard for you to connect, but in reality it's a million times harder for them to gather the strength and face their demons and fears.,But not all people who have these issue act the same. Some will act like the above along with the following ways such as : feeling trapped, look for negative things to help cope with how they are feeling.,I am not sharing this because I want to be heard but because I want those who read this to think more carefully about the loved ones in your life, may it be a spouse, a friend, a ,, or someone that you see randomly. In a non-aggressive way, we can all spark a light for change.,Because there are times I am that person who feels like I am drowning and there is no way to surface. But on the same token, I have been that person who doesn't understand and let my hurt from not understanding burden the one that needs help the most.,So again, if this subject hits home with you step back and say to yourself, ,. And if you are going through anxiety and depression, you are not crazy, you are loved, beautiful and just as important as anyone else in the world.,Remember to be brave, love one another that much more, and listen, because sometimes that is all it takes."
,"For some inexplicable reason, I decided one day to withdraw from everything in my life. At the time, I was studying abroad at university in Bremen, Germany. Instead of going to lectures, I retreated into a cocoon of duvets and a world of fantasy limited to the confines of my bedroom. I shut out the outside world and ignored all calls from friends and family. The only time I went out was late at night to the nearby convenience store to buy a bottle of coke or beer. The shopkeeper noticed my gradual deterioration and asked me if I was alright. The misery etched in my face was very apparent. My complexion had become pallid and I had dark-rings around my eyes due to poor sleep and diet. Like many people with depression, I responded “I’m fine”, knowing full well that I wasn’t.,It was as though fuse blew in my head and I felt no longer able to cope with day-to-day existence. During the day I slept and at night, I’d surf the internet to distract myself from the feeling that life had absolutely no meaning. Due to my lack of activity, my body became listless and exhausted, and I could no longer cope with even the most prosaic of tasks.,Things got really bad about 8 weeks into my self-imposed isolation when, foolishly, after a sleepless night I broke free from my miserable stasis and my squalid little bedroom. I boarded a train early in the morning for the Dutch city of Groningen where, after a long walk in the bitter cold, I entered a coffee shop and bought a couple of joints. I thought they’d calm me down, but they had the opposite effect. I felt my heartbeat race like it never had before. I then felt the ground move underneath me. I felt like my head was being filled with some gassy, incendiary fluid and was going to explode.,The panic wouldn’t subside. It got to a point that I convinced myself I was dying of a heart attack and begged a passerby to call an ambulance. After a quick check of my vitals, I was declared fine and told by the paramedics to eat some sugary food and sleep it off. I felt reassured, but still residual panic lingered and I felt strange tingling sensations on the train journey home. The next day, I woke up feeling exhausted from the day before but resolved to clean up my act. However, the panic returned, worse than ever and suddenly I felt as though I was being sucked into a vortex of despair and agony. It was a hellish sensation., Trying to fight it only made it worse and, very reluctantly, I told my landlord who also lived in the house I was staying in that I was suffering from ,. It was extremely embarrassing to admit this to somebody and a crushing blow to my self-esteem. I used to pride myself on being stoical, and yet here I was making a huge fuss about something that wasn’t even physical. Healthy males are meant to be awash with bonhomie, not enveloped by fear and despair like I was, I thought to myself. Luckily, my landlord noticed I was suffering and drove me to the nearest hospital. There, I checked into a psychiatric ward where I spent 8 long weeks getting myself fit again.,It was a surreal experience looking back on it. At times I felt fine; other times, I dissolved into undignified fits of crying and required a sedative to calm me down. Thankfully, I improved over time and was eventually able to find my way out of the darkness and even if the ,occasionally does creep back, I now have the techniques to keep it at bay. For a long time, I vowed never to tell my story for fear of what others might think. Male pride had prevented me from opening up to the world about how fragile and sensitive I really am. But here it is. I am unashamed to admit I was in a dark place, that the world had got on top of me and, rather than opening up about how I was feeling, I retreated into a place that only prolonged my suffering.,It’s so important that we open up to depression and anxiety so that anyone in a dark place can talk candidly to somebody about how they’re feeling. Don’t think that hiding how you’re feeling is the right way about it. It isn’t. Depression is not an indication of weakness, but a natural result of being a human being in a demanding and often chaotic world. To feel shame about it is to ignore what complex creatures us human beings really are and the myriad difficulties we face in our lives. The sooner people can ask for help, the sooner they will be able to improve. "
,"I've struggled with , as long as I can remember in my adult life. It's followed me everywhere I've gone, like a big heavy black gate dragging behind me. Up until 18, I was fine, but that's when I started hiding away from people – it's when my alcoholism started and it's at that point I started to just not feel comfortable around people.,Sixteen and a half years later, I'm still fighting the same fight day in, day out. It's led me to severe alcohol addictions, losing friends and a failed , attempt. After all that do I feel better? Well, not yet. I still struggle to explain this, I struggle to let family and friends in. Sometimes my working day feels like it's two days long, I limp through that and I then get to experience the joy of being on my own, fighting my mind, fighting ,, fighting alcohol dependencies and just…fighting to simply stay alive.,I hate it. Suicide is a normal thought for me and it's one I suppress, at the very least, weekly. I've never seen myself getting past 35, my 35th birthday is four months away and the nearer it gets the more confident I am that once I get to it I'll be a lot closer to pushing this to the back of my mind, rather than it playing like a never ending horror story that I've got to live every day.,In part I’ve accepted that this is going to be a life-long battle. As painful as it is to admit, I have to accept that this is going to be a part of me. I’ve never been in a serious relationship, partly because I don’t have any confidence in me, but mainly because I just don’t know how I would explain this to a significant other. I go days, sometimes weeks without talking to anyone. It’s not personal, it’s just that’s what I’ve got to do when this is at its worst. At its absolute worst, it takes every bit of strength within me to look after myself, to shower, brush my teeth etc. Despite all I experience, I still CANNOT talk to anyone about this without breaking down in tears. I want to be surrounded by my friends and family, but at the same time I don’t want to be anywhere near anyone. I hate it, I hate just how much it takes me away from being me. It’s the hardest thing to explain to people.,When I'm feeling suicidal this is when I find it the hardest to engage anyone, friends, family, management. It's hard enough talking to people when my depression hits its peak but when suicidal thoughts start to swirl I close off. I just can't bring myself to say it. I called 'The Samaritans' when I was near my worst and I instantly broke down.,Thankfully, I have the most magnificent ,. I have always emphasised this to them through social media, verbal and non-verbal communication. I pride myself on the strength I have to defeat this at regular intervals – sure it's hard but they all trust when to leave me alone and when I want to talk. It's just hard sitting across from someone you love and telling them you're contemplating suicide.,I've always found it hard to speak to people – I just don't want them worrying. At my lowest I write and write and write, as I find this is the most therapeutic way for me to deal with everything that I have to deal with. I don't feel awkward, or as if I'm burdening people, which is something I feel as if I'm doing when I ask people if I can talk.,However, ultimately, I know that I'm not burdening people and what I'm going through is real, it's not always easy but I wish we could all have more confidence to just…tell people exactly how we're feeling. If we could just talk about what goes on, hopefully this would make people struggling more comfortable with just...telling people what is wrong so that they can get the support that they need.,I guess the advice I would give to others going through it is no matter how dark it gets, there’s always a light at the end of that dank, dark, spider infested tunnel that you walk through. By , about what's happening we move closer to the end of that tunnel. We need to create an society where talking about this is normal, so that people feel able to reach out towards that light."
", "," something I’ve lived with for most of my life. So, I'm writing written this post to highlight what effects mental illnesses, including people’s attitudes about them, can have on a person. ,To give you my background: though I’ve always had low self esteem and confidence issues, anxiety didn’t really start until my teens. During my teens I would retreat to my room and sit in what I assumed was blissful solitude. When , members would visit they would ask “why’s he up in his room?” without ever asking why. I would never attend family get-togethers, and again my family would never ask why, they would just assume it’s my low self esteem or would never approach me and ask me what’s wrong.,During my , years, of all the challenges I faced the one I never expected was bullying, both inside the school and out, which formed a big part of my mental state for years. Without even realising it had affected me in ways I couldn’t imagine, whenever in town my muscles would tense in what I would assume was an ensuing fight, my fingers would tap the palm of my hands as part of muscle tenseness (though I would refer to this as playing the neck of a guitar) and it wasn’t until I got away from the group of particularly dressed people that I would calm down.,During my time at college I became ever more retreated into myself, the friendships I had formed I told myself would last and wouldn’t end on the final day of the college. This however did happen and I found m self even more isolated. Once I had finished college it was time to search for work, I couldn’t imagine the stress and anxiety I would come to feel. It was during this time that anxiety fully took over: I had no social life, and the only source of relief I found was in films, TV shows and books. Daily job searches and dealings with the Job Centre, it felt like I had taken on the weight of the world. I had no idea how much my mental health was suffering I didn’t talk about it to anyone.,It was during this time that , crept in as well, my view of the world had become so bleak I couldn’t see a way out. Any time the idea of medication would come up I would shut it down immediately. With no one to talk to, I isolated myself from family and my view of the world became ever more dreary. Then after four years of job searching I decided to sign off JSA and onto ESA, it felt like the weight of the world had been lifted and my view of the became a bit more brighter. Alas, I couldn’t remain on it forever I was forced back onto JSA and although I had been to two group CBT (cognitive behavioural therapy) courses, I felt like I could barely cope. The pressure became too much and I started taking medication to deal with it.,I have even tackled thoughts of ,. This just reveals how messed up my thoughts have become. I have faced , around these thoughts – just because people don’t understand what you’re going through doesn’t give them the right to question the sincerity of your thoughts and feelings.,I have also faced stigma around the other mental health challenges I’ve faced with comments like “you have nothing to worry about”, “just let things roll off your back”. Clearly they don’t understanding what it’s like for me; what they assume is an innocent comment actually hurts deeply as they just don’t understand what I’m feeling despite my best efforts to explain anxiety to them.,This isn’t the first blog I’ve written about my mental health experiences, I have found them a great help to write as not only do they help my family to understand me better but also they allow me to show others that they are not alone.,I've written this because attitudes towards mental health need to change. Just because we experience these thoughts and feelings doesn’t give people the right to make comments about something they don’t understand. However, writing and talking about mental health can be a great help. Don’t hide it away from people who can understand. It’s time to change!"
,"Travelling through the other side of depression, there’s a sudden realisation that the end of the tunnel, the road to recovery, is achievable.,An only child, dealing with family illness proved tough – even though, at the time, I thought I was dealing with the stress. Both , going through serious illnesses (luckily all is well with all) and both remaining grandparents passing at wonderful ages (93 and 101!), it seems all of this piled up on me.,I am a secondary , teacher and, at the time, worked in a school which was losing control. Students bullying staff was commonplace. No support from senior staff made me physically ill. I changed schools – the obvious problem solver?,Yet, bullying continued in the new school. Not from students, but from senior staff. Stress is shown physically in my eczema. My GP even treated me for scabies; such were the severity of the marks all over my back. My GP wanted to see me two weeks later: for reasons I was unaware of. ,.,He diagnosed me. I took the prescribed medication and attended ten, wonderful, counselling sessions.,Yet, bulling continued. Senior staff had no idea – and didn’t want to know – about my illness. One even dismissing it as “It’s just ,...I even wake up in the middle of the night thinking about work.” This ignorance made me feel even worse.,My union and GP recommended long-term sickness. I spent this sleeping in darkness until mid-afternoon, each day. Leaving the house proved difficult. But I wanted to leave the house, go back to ,, go back to reality.,The school had a ‘get-rid’ attitude and offered ‘staged’ support. In my state, I could see though this, luckily. But, I had to go through the motions with union support and ultimately was dismissed from my job due to ‘Ill-health capability’.,I had to question: if I was in a car accident, broke my leg, had complications with the recovery and healing process, would the school go through the ‘Ill-health capability’ procedure? Of course not. They would understand the recovery problems and understand time is required to heal. Depression requires time – but who understands that? And how much time? There is no answer to that question.,I was dismissed December 2015 – took a few months recovery/reality time – and signed up with an agency who got me a wonderful job in a school from April to July. Suddenly, the end of the tunnel appears. A school with a human ethos. A supporting network. Reality exists.,Recovery is happening. It takes time. It takes support. My family, in-laws, my wife, friends, were all amazing. I am fortunate to have had that. I hid a lot. , is the answer. Finding who to speak to is the most difficult. Avoid the stigma, dismiss the ignorance, and find understanding – it is there, somewhere; recovery happens in your own time. , is worrying still there in the 21st Century and this needs to be constantly challenged."
,"These were the first words my dad said to me after I completely broke down and confessed all of my darkest thoughts about myself and explained the true extent of my mental illness. He didn't run, he didn't scream and shout or get angry, he didn't question me. It felt like an out-of-body experience, like I was watching myself tell him about a part of my life that had plagued me for so many years.,I appreciate how lucky I am in having the father that I've got. He's sensitive, kind, patient, caring and understanding. He does his best to sympathise with my mental health problems and comforts and consoles me when my worries are overwhelming. He has always provided me with a safe environment to express my emotions, to cry without judgement and to be myself. I am so fortunate that I've grown up in a household that is comfortable talking about feelings, fears and problems.,However, with regards to mental health, we only spoke about it when it was clear that I was struggling with mental illness myself. From my diagnosis of , and , when I was 15, the conversation only grew. In fact, after a phone call that I've just had with my dad, I discovered that not only was he officially diagnosed with depression after my parents split up but he was prescribed anti-depressants. But when he had only taken a few he felt suicidal and after speaking with his mum he stopped taking them. He told me that talking with good , members, and having to look after me and be a responsible parent, kept him grounded and gradually helped him see through the fog of depression.,In a , conducted by Time To Change, statistics show that half of , boys (49%) aged 16–18 feel uncomfortable talking to their dads about mental health issues. That's a staggering figure when you consider that if we were talking about physical health, the number would almost certainly be far lower. The idea that guys should try and 'man up' or 'put on a brave face' when dealing with mental health problems is so damaging. The , only grows and spreads silence, shame and fear. Our fathers are the people we look to when growing up and learning how to behave, learning what is right and wrong. The time has come that , is something that you shouldn't be ashamed of. It shouldn't hide in the shadows and remain a taboo topic.,If you are a father reading this and you've been brought up to believe that talking about your emotions or your mental health is wrong, I urge you to take a leap of faith and speak out. Your son will learn from you, and being a positive mental health role model will only stand them in good stead for later life. You can be the change that is so desperately needed to help future generations of men to feel confident enough to open up about their experience with mental illness. , is the biggest killer of men under the age of 45 in the UK. You, yes you reading this right now, you can be part of the generation that starts changing this figure.,Speak up, listen to your son, educate yourself about mental illness. Don't be afraid of feeling vulnerable or scared. There is nothing wrong with crying. Gone are the days where men are emotionless, stoic pillars of society. You have feelings that are just as valid as anyone else's. You can create a society where young men feel able to talk about mental illness.,You can be the change."
,"During my final year at ,, I was aged 20, and finally asked for help from my GP. In the words of my younger brother, I’ve always been a bit ‘quirky’. I have a hard time processing emotion sometimes, and I’ve plummeted from inescapable lows to strange highs in a matter of days since ,. I’d spend hours obsessing over the idea that people were laughing at me, worrying about my weight, my appearance, feeling uncomfortable in my own skin. But I remember continuously telling myself, this is how every teenager feels, right? Turns out, not everyone does. I assumed my erratic emotions were the norm, and that my deep, dark moods were simply ‘hormones’ figuring themselves out.,University gave me highs and lows much like in my previous years at home, but my final year it all became too much. I received differing opinions from GPs and mental health, where words like ,, ,, ,were all being thrown in the mix. This should have made me feel relieved, and at first it did, until I realised what that meant in the eyes of friends. I had and still have a hugely supportive ,, close friends that surround me. However, not everybody reacts well to a friend or housemate getting a diagnosis of a mental health condition.,Whilst trying to come to terms with my own mental health, a few close members of my friendship group too struggled with coming to grips with my new diagnosis and where it fit into their own lives. Living with me concerned them, confused a few of them, and ultimately led to irreparable differences. They used words such as ‘dangerous’, and convinced me that self harm was the first step to being able to harm somebody else. Whether they truly believed this or really just didn’t like me very much is something I’ll never really figure out, but a year later I still struggle with the stigma they attached to me that month in my final year, where everything seemed to be spiralling. This eventually lead to me ending up in a hospital bed, plagued with guilt explaining to my family how and why my mind had lead me to such dark places., for mental health is subtle in many places in the UK, but it is there, lingering and can be really damaging when perhaps a person need’s is support and guidance. Now, I know myself not to be a dangerous person, but it took me a long time to distinguish where my mental illness ended and where I, the person began. Now I have come to realise it is a part of me, and it isn’t going away any time soon. But that’s okay. What isn’t okay, is that both men and women being diagnosed with mental health issues are being spoken to as they are in some way less of a person, less of a productive citizen because of illnesses they can’t control, or don’t know how to. My biggest advice to anybody with a friend or family member with a mental health problem is just listen.,Student environments full of gossip, deadlines and social pressures can be really tough, let alone with a mental illness chucked into the mix. I am now just taking life day by day, am currently off medication and working constantly to keep an optimistic mind-set. I know firsthand how much a reassuring support system can do on those particularly dark and confusing days. I hope to one day be able to take openly about my mental illness with others without worrying about how their image of me will change, but for now, a blog will do just fine."
,"In my past I have and still frequently experience ,. I've used medication for years trying to deal with it, but it does have side effects. I understand that mine may not be considered as severe as many others'. But it's severe enough to affect me, my relationships and my life. ,I believe after 20 years, I have a decent grasp in dealing with depression and have a wonderful, supportive wife who helps me. She understands and helps me to identify periods when I'm affected (as sometimes I'm unaware when it arrives), and she does what she can to assist me through it. ,Although at times I feel so negative about everything, I don't realise how I'm being perceived by others and sincerely don't intend to be short or horrible to people. But this is not a mood nor is it the fact that I'm Mr. Grumpy pants and believe it or not, I honestly believe I'm a nice guy. But when I'm like this, this is me literally trying desperately not to unload the poison in my brain on to you! ,There was a time when many people at , became close to me, we had a fabulous time for a couple of years, but unfortunately they saw that I had this side and immediately distanced themselves from me, eventually completely disregarding my existence. Other things happened too that weighed very heavily on me (long term relationship breakdowns, bereavements etc.). For my last year (still in a dark place), I had to start again with friends and acquaintances and housemates... this hurt... a lot! But I've grown to realise that it's their loss – I am worth knowing. I will bring you laughter and sensitivity. Plus I give consistent amazing advice, which I can't seem to act on myself. ,And if it wasn't for my new ,, my kids and especially my wife, I literally don't know who I'd be or what I'd be doing now, all I can say is 'it wouldn't be anything good!',I've carved out a profession that supports people with health conditions. This is brilliant!!! I love it. My strength in my work is helping people that have similar illnesses. I'm very , about my past and my ability to empathise and this binds our professional relationship.,Being on the Mental Health First Aid course also shows me that we as a nation are soooo far behind compared to others in understanding mental health. ,Such as: ,Now ask yourself a question... how often do you see an advert on TV educating us about poor mental health compared to adverts about speeding or drink driving???,Now you can see where the emphasis lies!,... focus on your future!,Every experience is a valuable one, the bad experiences are sometiems the best because you learn from those more. ,If you experience depression, then YOU HAVE EARNED THOSE EXPERIENCES!!! THEY ARE YOURS!!! Now how can you use that? Good Luck! "
", ","This is a new experience for me: talking so publicly about myself. I feel this is important to do so, especially on ,, because talking about my mental health in the first place was the first step in making positive changes to my life.,My name is Marc and I found out this year that I have been trying to live with generalised , disorder (GAD) for most of my life. I was always aware that I worried a lot about things, was quite shy and would go through bouts of ,(which led twice to me trying to end my life) – but didn't realise I could get help. I just accepted it was who I was. That was until a life changing event made me visit my GP. This is when I began to ,. ,My marriage had ended and I felt so low that I went to the doctor to discuss medication; an antidepressant is what I thought I needed. I was prescribed the drugs but I was also introduced to a counsellor. The counsellor I saw was there to help me with the recent events and coming to terms with the break up. As I spoke about myself in the sessions, it was apparent there was much more that needed discussing and looking at to help me feel better. ,I felt happy that I could move on from counselling and I was encouraged to see a CBT therapist. This is when the GAD came to light. It was strange how having GAD recognised as a condition gave me hope that the crippling anxiety I had experienced for the past 30 years could maybe be dealt with. I now had hope that I could learn to live a life with a better mental health. ,At first I kept this all a secret as I was ashamed of being seen to be “weak”, but as time went on, I learnt more about myself. I built up a bit of self confidence and was a bit happier overall. This, coupled with the antidepressants, gave me the opportunity to start to talk to people about my mental health. To my surprise people listened and did not judge, some even could relate with similar experiences of their own. I felt so relieved. This built my confidence further and it also gave others confidence to talk about mental health making it less of a ,In July of this year, I had another life changing event: I started a new career. I left the job I had been doing for 12 years and decided to start a career as a domiciliary care worker. I would never have considered this line of , before because my low self esteem and my anxieties would have prevented me from doing so. But thanks to me talking and being open about my mental health condition (I even mentioned it in the job interview) I am now in a position where I feel good about my life and the help I bring to others.,Talking has helped me to be me."
", ","One of the great things about social media is having an unexpected, online chat at stupid o'clock at night, with a friend who lives many miles away.,The conversation turned to my early stage breast cancer diagnosis. “You're so brave,” my old friend wrote on Facebook messenger.,I've heard this several times, since my diagnosis earlier this year. It, and variations on that theme.,It started me thinking about the number of times someone has said this when my , was giving me grief, or when my , was so sky high it was practically in nodding distance of Mars. Or when I was so deeply ,, suicide seemed not just a viable option, but the only one.,It was an easy comparison, because no one's ever said it. No one has ever told me I was brave because I was dealing with mania, or through-the-roof anxiety, or ,.,And yet, there are few things braver in this world than to get out of bed when there seems no point. To stay out of bed. To stay alive, when there really seems no reason. (There is a point; there always is, but seeing it when you're in the depths of despair is like looking for a black cat, at midnight, in an area with no street lights, when you've just lost your torch.),You can't get much braver than doing your absolute level best to stay alive, to keep going, when every single cell in your body is seemingly screaming at you to stop, to give up, to quit.,These feelings are not helped by being told – by ,, and, yes, mental health care providers – to “just get on with it”, when my mental health takes a dive.,One of these days, the message to “just get on with things” is going to be served up with a generous side portion of “and I know that takes real guts”.,It's brave to keep going, when you want to stop. It takes even more courage, even more guts, to start doing things again, once we've come to a stop. Even braver, in my experience, than dealing with day surgery, or radiotherapy, or endless hospital appointments.,One of these days, I'll get one of those side portions. One day, more and more people struggling with mental health problems will be told how brave we are when we carry on living. When we carry on, carrying on.,When that happens – when more and more people recognise the determination, and guts, it takes to live and indeed thrive with mental health problems – we'll know times really have changed."
,"A lot of people see , as attacks on people with mental health problems, as people who sneer and judge us, or try and deny that mental health is a real issue – that it's all made up. However, over the years I've noticed it can be in the little things too, someone chiding us for being lazy or withdrawn, despite the fact they know we have depression and/or anxiety. It can be found in the way people will laugh and joke around about , or ,, some of them don't even realise the impact they're having because in their head they're not doing it maliciously. Mental health stigma can be found in the , and parents who are uninformed about the different mental health issues and how to deal with them. ,I remember people in my school making jokes about self-harm or suicide, when talking about homework or a particularly troublesome exam or teacher. The fact they didn't understand that what they were doing would have an impact of people shows just how ingrained the stigma is. They don't see it as a big issue, and thus it's something that they can joke about. None of them knew that every night I'd go home weeping ashamed of my , and ,, ashamed that I couldn't find their jokes funny when they poked fun at my weaknesses and fears.,As my knowledge about my own mental health issues developed, so too did my sensitivity to these comments. It wasn't even so much the content that bothered me, it was the way they made my depression into something meaningless, something to be laughed and joked about rather than helped.,It hurt even more when I would see them share posts or write tweets about not bullying, or raising awareness about suicide. I was too scared to confront them, and tell them that their jokes were contributing to those statistics about suicide and people going years without a diagnosis. They didn't realise what they were doing was wrong because it was just a joke to them – they weren't directly attacking anyone, at least not in their mind.,Stigma needs to be addressed. People need to be educated about mental health and its consequences. People should be taught to respect mental health issues, and that making jokes about it contributes to the harm and suffering of people who experience them. I was too scared to get help because I felt embarrassed. Everyone else found mental health issues funny, so was I just attention seeking or faking it? I realise now looking back that of course I wasn't. I still suffer from depression and anxiety, and it's horrible. My feelings are valid, and I'm no longer ashamed to say that yes I struggle with these issues. I've found myself confronting more people about their jokes even though it terrifies me, because when I was at my worst I needed someone to do that for me, to let me know that my feelings and struggles weren't a joke and that they could be helped. I didn't get that until a few years later – by then the impact is so long term that I often have days where I struggle to think of what life was like without depression.,That's why I'm so passionate about combating stigma. I'm doing it for all the people who have been in my situation or worse – by changing attitudes, we are saving lives. We are helping people get the treatment they need, we're helping them feel less alone, letting them know if something is wrong and what to do.,The truth is, we all need to take part in combating the stigma surrounding mental health. We need to discuss these issues with our ,, and we need to make them feel safe to talk to us, not belittle people who seem to get upset over minute things because we should respect that their feelings are valid.,I hope to live in a world where we no longer need mental health awareness days, because everyone is informed and educated about it. They know who to turn to and what to do, they know how to spot the warning signs, or how to tell when something is wrong. Until that day though I am going to be fighting the stigma as much as I can, and so should you."
,"I think I’ve always potentially been on the edge of ,creeping into my core, from a young age. Over the years, I’ve managed to somehow only be half way there. Teetering on the edge of it taking over. Like the intruder lurking in the darkness waiting to strike!,Summer of 2013, I had fallen pregnant with my first child. In a nutshell, it was a difficult pregnancy. Aside from the incredible feeling, of my beautiful daughter moving inside me, it was far from the glowing experience you read in magazines. I could feel myself starting to struggle then, feeling very different to my normal self and physically sick for what felt like an eternity. I pushed on as a brand new mother, suffering the usual, sleep deprivation and general adjustment from my life before. During this time I was getting mentally weaker and more exhausted. But it wasn’t just, I haven’t slept exhaustion. My whole body was dragging its way through. I could feel it starting to creep into every corner of me., By the following year, my ,was breaking down and I was literally feeling like I was going to explode. Struggling to reach out and explain how I was feeling, mostly for fear that my capability as a mother would be thrown into question, I began ,. I relied on this extreme coping mechanism, as I struggled to deal with this thing, constantly building up inside me. I hated myself. And every time I gave into it, I hated myself more. My body hurt all over and my head was just a fog. The physical pain of my wounds wasn’t even close to my mental suffering.,Eventually I took myself to the doctor. I was desperate for help. I had no choice but to get out of bed every day. I was needed. But it took everything I had. I actually owe my life and strength to my daughter. Without her, I’m almost certain I would have just given up completely.,Since last year, when I moved out of the family home (which was devastating) I have been very insular. I came off social media and have literally spent 2016 so far, trying to piece myself back together, whilst throwing all of myself into being the best mother I can be. I have good support from family and close friends, for which I feel grateful. It has undoubtedly helped me through the eye of the storm. I am beginning to see actual Nic emerging again. But it never really goes away. I feel very different and detached., People have been commenting lately how well I look. It’s fascinating, because sometimes,  I feel anything but. Behind my smiley face is often unimaginable pain that I am chipping away at day by day. People see me as generally fun, down to earth and full of banter. And you know what, that is actually me. I'm so glad people see that, it’s who I really am. I also now know that I am incredibly strong. That strong warrior Nic, is constantly having to fight, to stop the enemy (depression) from taking me away. Dragging me off, just like the bad spirits in the film ,, when they drag the bad guy to hell.,The point in this, I guess, is that no one, unless I have opened up to them, would know that behind what they think they see as Nic, is a broken soul on a constant mission for the battle to be over! I am just an ordinary woman with so much to give and to live for. I hate it when I see quotes that go on about choosing happiness. I do choose bloody happiness! I didn’t get to pick and choose whether depression affects me. I don’t want it. I hate it and it will not win. Depression does not define me. It isn’t me, it’s just an intense shadow that follows me around."
,"I’ve had very clear signs of ,since my early teens but it took me until the age of 30 to pluck up the courage to seek help from my GP.  Despite having a good relationship with my ,, it’s never an easy subject to broach, regardless of how close we are. I still don’t especially enjoy talking about it with anyone in person, which is part of the reason why blogs are great! It’s easiest to talk about with those who’ve experienced it themselves, but I would love it if it were easy to talk to everyone about depression. ,People often think depression is a choice to be pessimistic or lazy or simply a negative personality trait. It needs to be understood and recognised as a genuine illness. I didn’t understand this myself until recently.  I’ve googled ‘what’s the difference between depression and laziness?’  I’ve become exasperated with myself for not being as productive as others. This cruel and false judgement exacerbates the feeling of guilt and makes the depression itself worse.,My wish is for people to open their minds and think about the effect their words might have on someone.  People with depression typically think differently to those without it. What a non-sufferer regards as encouragement, an innocent question, or polite conversation, might be perceived as interrogation by those affected.,I was always told I was bright and I ‘should’ be doing something more than library , but I really didn’t know what. I qualified as a nutritional therapist aged 30 and saw it as my sole chance to do something ‘proper’. But I was absolutely petrified, totally overwhelmed and stuck in a destructive procrastination/guilt cycle.  People asked me whether I’d set up my nutrition practice. When I answered ‘no’, they’d say ‘You can do it, you’re just under-estimating yourself!’ What I REALLY wanted someone to say is ‘If you can’t do it, that’s also acceptable!’ ,All these supposedly ‘inspirational’ messages through the media: ‘Follow your dreams!’, ‘achieve anything you want!’ ‘just think positively!’ can be so damaging and often do the opposite of inspiring people.  What about telling people it’s okay not to climb a mountain, get a first-class degree, write a best-selling novel or win a gold medal? More seemingly mediocre achievements are incredibly worthwhile if they’re significant to you personally.,Currently, I feel confident and positive about my life and future.  I've not been diagnosed with , disorder but I've had periods of depression and hypomania (low-level mania). The phase where I come out of a depressive episode and start enjoying the things I used to do again is always great and I feel so good that I don't think the depression will ever come back.  What’s upsetting is, looking back through my life, I've seen it recur so many times and I don't think I've ever been 2 years without being depressed (that I can remember). Knowing that it may come back is a depressing thought so I wrote myself a letter (or blog!) to ensure I can prepare for it as well as possible.,What bothers me the most about my depressive episodes is the binge-eating and weight gain (the fact that I qualified as a nutritional therapist increases this guilt!) and the constant debilitating (and incorrect) thought that everyone is superior to me. I might not be able to stop the depression from recurring but I can manage it as best as I can.,Those with depression generally aren’t confident in their own decisions and are affected strongly by what others think and say. People shouldn’t feel they’re walking on eggshells and that they can’t say anything for fear of upsetting someone but we could all benefit from being more open-minded."
", ","Hello lovelies. My name is Katie Ellen and I have struggled with , and , for as long as I can remember. However, I wasn't professionally diagnosed until my late teens and this is mainly because I was scared. Scared to open up, scared of the truth and most of all scared of the stigma that comes with being ‘mentally ill’.,Now I will be 100% honest with you in the fact that I haven’t had many experiences with mental health , but what I can tell you is that on the rare occasion I have it has come from someone that I know and care about. I believe deeply that the people who have said things to me have done so out of concern. You see, when people get scared or worried they tend to say things that come across as rude and insensitive. For example, “Why are you back on your medication? You’ve been fine!”, “But you have nothing to be depressed about?” or “Just push yourself to leave the house, you will feel so much better when you do!”.,Although I know that these things deep down come from a good place I can’t help but feel like if you don’t have a mental illness it’s hard to understand how painful it is to hear things like that. I wish I didn’t have to take medication daily, I wish I knew why my mind sometimes wants to hurt me in ways you can’t imagine and I sure as hell wish that leaving the house was as simple as feeling motivated to do so.,I know that from the above I may seem angry and upset by the comments people make but honestly I’m not. Personally the way I overcome mental health stigma is to see things from a different point of view. The people who make the choice to attack people with a mental illness are often uneducated on the topic. We were never taught in school how to deal with or look after someone with a mental illness. ,I feel that with the internet being a huge thing in young people’s lives it is our job to make sure that they understand mental health. Although lots of us face stigma it is important to try to brush it off. Your mental health does not define your character and I believe that if we all have the strength to fight mental illness daily we also have the strength to not get angry at those who stigmatise us but instead try to reason with them and explain politely that mental illness is not something fictional but that it is something we cannot control and have to live with on a daily basis.,I want to thank ‘Time To Change’ for giving us all an opportunity to speak out about this and to help us fight against mental health stigma. I know that if I would of seen this website a few years back I would of gotten help a lot sooner had I known that there where others exactly like me. "
,"I had my first serious bout of ,when I was eighteen. I’d been trying to get my A-Levels, after some missteps made me realise that yes, I actually am quite academic and not an artist, but I had to leave the course. I eventually overcame this depression with pills and time; I got some A Levels and I finally got in to university, five years behind most of the other people there. I struggled to see this as an achievement in itself, and instead worried about age and how other people seemed to be so much more put-together and normal. ,I have thought about my depressive episodes as periods from my life which have been taken away from me, voids of time I have wasted. I think that this has actually made me more of a perfectionist, more insecure about wanting to succeed, whatever that means. As I’m approaching thirty and now have yet another bad bout of depression behind me, I’m, at times, left thinking that I have wasted my twenties. I compare myself to people who have gone down different paths and probably have many of their own problems. I think we’re encouraged to put out the best view of ourselves and to hide our perceived bad parts from other people. ,I was insecure about my own depression. Firstly, I was focused on ,. This became easier the more I talked about it and society has become a lot more amenable, in this way, in the last ten years. It seemed more of a big deal, in most cases, in my head than it did when I actually talked to someone about my illnesses. I rehearsed talking about my depression to my now-fiancé for weeks; I made it into a confession. He said he’d had a similar thing, which shocked me!,But still, many of the mental health stories that you hear are from people who “overcame” their problems. They’re better now, mental illness is something that you “beat”. Perhaps in the midst of the worst of it we are unable to tell stories properly, and we don’t want to dwell on the bad times when we are well. We are used to telling ‘character overcoming hardship’ stories and, of course, mental illness is hard. But it is very difficult to capture. We are telling these stories now, but only in ‘everything is okay now’ ways. Social media is particularly to blame here, I think. ,We have come a long way in understanding mental illness in recent years. But we need to develop a more nuanced way of looking at mental illness. Sometimes, a lot of the time and for many of us, these illnesses are with us for life: less like a broken leg, more like a chronic condition. At the moment they seem to be seen as something to overcome, which is a dangerous narrative for somebody who feels like they can’t fight anymore. ,I found antidepressants helped me (again) immeasurably over this past winter and spring but, as someone who is doing a master’s degree in Creative Writing, it was a problem that I could not write on them. So I gave them up and my various thoughts and feelings have returned. They numbed my curiosity and, although some sadness and ,returned when I stopped taking them, I felt IQ points return too. I didn’t want to try any other brands – they did what they promised. It’s just that when you stop taking medication for other illnesses, most of the time you are cured. ,My bouts with depression are not something I have to gloss over, even when it gets better for a bit. People are very vocal about their success, particularly on social media, but we're not so comfortable with the perceived failures, things we're still working on, things we might live with on and off forever.,We are changing that, slowly, whenever we’re honest and show our vulnerabilities, we can change the way people think about mental health."
,"Admitting , is an illness and not something that's my fault in some way or another is a hard thing to admit to yourself. After all who really wants to admit they're ill with something that's all in your head. Cancer is a different matter, people can see it – people are sympathetic. People don't understand depression, they just think it's just something you need to get over and cheer up. Life can't be that bad surely!,I mean, depression means you're , – this doesn't happen to normal people right? Even saying the word out aloud or writing it down on a piece of paper, the same way you write any other word doesn't make it seem any more real. But it is! I'm ill with depression, I didn't ask for it to happen to me but it has. Truth is, I think I've been suffering with it far longer than I've been officially diagnosed. I still remember the day I sat in front of the doctor with my sister, admitting I couldn't cope and asking for help.,Most days it's torment in my head even if I’m smiling and laughing – it's there trying to creep in. It's hard trying to explain what it feels like to other people, a dark cloud descends and it's like fighting a war with yourself. People say try to look at the positives in your life, they don't understand you really are trying your best and it's on those days you're fighting your hardest. Some days it's got so bad, you just want the pain to end.,Depression has to some degree taken more from me than I've taken from it. It's changed me into a person I don't like and at times have loathed. I feel I've ruined friendships and have said some things I can't undo. I feel guilty for bothering people with my problems, being a burden is on no-one’s wish list. To those people I'm deeply sorry, please forgive me and please don't hate, without you there as a friend I won't have anything to keep fighting for. Above all, please be patient – I will find a way to pay you back for your kindness and support. It's no easy task supporting someone with depression but at times like this you find out who your true , are; I hope to be able to know these people for the rest of my life.,I'm scared I'll always feel this way and people will eventually see me, the same way I see myself at the moment. I still have some way to go to accepting my illness and moving forward to a better place but it's something I need to do otherwise the cycle will just continue and things will get worse. I'm starting counselling again soon and will small steps I'm giving myself a fighting chance. I don't want to feel this way forever and with that I hold on to that little glimmer of hope."
", ","When I was 18, my life was a mess. I had a great job, but I was struggling to make the most of it because of my mental state.,I had an unsettled childhood, and at home I could be downright unpleasant to my family. As I got older, instead of growing out of the ‘naughty’ phase, things got worse. My grades at school were good, and although I never went to university I landed myself a good job in the Civil Service at only 17. I was academic, I made my family proud. But at home, things were different. I began to resent my mother for the upheaval in my childhood, and I felt like an outsider in my own home. My three younger sisters have always been close to each other and I struggled to form that bond with them. I had always had difficulties with my mood, although at the time I thought I just felt sad and it was normal. I would cut off friends for the smallest reasons, and found it hard to maintain relationships with friends and family.,When I was 18, things got worse. My ‘low’ periods would last weeks, sometimes months. I began , and was plagued with , and I couldn’t get myself out of bed in the morning. And then, all of a sudden, I was fine. I was bright, bubbly, the life of the party. I was constantly dissatisfied, wondering why nobody could keep up with me. I wanted change, big change in my life. I would drink until I couldn’t stand. But nothing was good enough. I always wanted something more. This mania, as I now know it, could last anywhere from a day to a week. Never as long as my lows, but in some ways they were more dangerous. My behaviour became reckless, and I had no regard for anybody but myself. Sometimes not even myself.,On my mother’s advice, I went to my GP to ask her what everybody had long suspected – ‘do I have ,?’. I didn’t even get to begin to explain my symptoms before the doctor became irritated. No, I didn’t. I was a teenager and all teenagers feel this way, she told me. I believed her and it took another year to go back and ask again.,On my 19th birthday, I hit a low. I had hosted a house party and at the start I was having a great time – dancing, drinking, my friends cringing as my behaviour became more and more outrageous. My best friend found me in the bathroom later that night, crying and covered in blood. I was ashamed of what I had done to myself, and as the ambulance was called, I realised I needed help. It was a turning point.,It took a few more months, but I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder. I got the help I needed, and I was prescribed medication to help regulate my mood. It took longer than it should have because the area I was living in was heavily oversubscribed for mental health services. ,There are still days where I struggle. I don’t want to take my medication because I feel ‘fine’. I pick fights with my boyfriend for no real reason. It flares up in times of stress and I’m still learning to deal with it. I have good people around me, and I’m lucky to have had the love and support my , have provided. ,Mental health is a difficult journey. Nobody should be discounted or stereotyped because of them. Awareness is very important – it’s taken a long time for me to be open about my condition for fear of being seen differently because of it. ,I always call myself the crazy one, but I’m not. I’m just as normal as everyone else. It’s important to remember that."
,"I am a 20 year old female, I have recently come out of hospital (a psychiatric intensive care unit) after my last admission, which was my 3rd, all have been under sections.,I have been diagnosed with Borderline personality disorder emotional and antisocial, PTSD (post traumatic stress disorder), attachment disorder, anxiety, depression and, to put the cherry on the bun, insomnia.,From face value, I look very respectable, have a very good work life, a nice home and a stable relationship. This is what people see and they automatically assume that I am fine and because they can not see any off my illnesses it must not matter or they must not be that important. I want to break that stigma, show people the truth of what it's really like living with illnesses such as these, in the hope people will start to understand, empathise and acknowledge that mental health can not be brushed under the carpet and ignored.,My , makes me have very fast emotional switches, one moment I'm okay and in the next breathe I'm in hysterical tears and I want to commit suicide, then I might feel sad and in the next moment I'm filled with rage and this leads to me becoming very irrational and impulsive putting myself in dangerous situations and from there I can go to feeling completely nothing, like a hollowness an empty feeling and I feel it to the point it hurts physically. This then can lead me to self harming in many different forms, this in sense brings me back to normality for a moment.,My recent diagnosis of ,, this makes things that have happened in the past come back very real for me, I have flashbacks that can last for hours and this is non less than a mental torture having to relive that amount of trauma over and over again. My body's coping mechanism to this is disassociation, totally disconnecting you to that period as though you're watching yourself rather than it being you, this also leads to periods of pure freezing and zoning out completely and when you come back you can't remember any of the events that have just happened.,All of this then has a bad impact on my , making it a vicious circle, people see depression as you might be a bit ""moody"", well I can tell you that depression is not just that, it's physically not having the strength to get out of bed, to do menial chores such as brushing your teeth, eating, cleaning yourself, staying in the same clothes for days, not talking to people, wanting affection but at the same time you can't bear people near you, refusing help because you feel you don't deserve it.,Then there's my anxiety, I struggle immensely with going to appointments, talking on the phone, being in crowds, going to the shops alone, meeting new people. This then leads to anxiety attacks, which feels to me like a physical pain in my chest a tightness as though I can't breath.,Too many people still don’t realise: mental illness is real, it is a daily battle, a daily fight with yourself just to stay alive, it is not something to be brushed under the carpet and ignored. The stigma needs to end."
,"I’ve always found it difficult to talk about my feelings and thoughts. Words don’t seem to do justice the depth and intensity of these emotions. My automatic response is to say I’m fine. I’m trying to change this because as John Keating says Dead Poets Society “you must strive to find your own voice. Because the longer you wait to begin, the less likely you are to find it at all”. Until a couple of years ago I took these thoughts at face value. Having anxiety was my normal. I thought that this was how I’m supposed to experience worry: by obsessing over every worst case scenario especially the ones outside of my control. But being fearful to live is not normal nor is it a healthy way to live. And because I wasn’t doing the things other people my age were doing I also had a fear that life was passing me by.,I was diagnosed with general anxiety disorder during the spring of 2013. But the doctor wanted to treat the symptoms of the panic attacks with beta blockers rather that the causes of the anxiety. Things did not begin to improve. Indeed the next year would be the worst I’ve ever felt. I felt so guilty about existing when there was nothing I could control especially my reaction to the things that made me anxious for example having a panic attack every day for weeks on end. It seemed like I couldn’t get anything right. The thing about depression is that I didn’t realise what was happening to me until it was too late. There wasn’t one day where I woke up and wasn’t depressed and by the time I went to bed I was. Rather it was a steady progression of my mood getting lower and lower; starting by making everything subdued and ending by convincing me that I was the most disgusting and vilest person possible.,Mental illnesses also has this way of telling me that no one wanted to hear about what I was going through. If not for an absolutely horrible work situation I think I would still be listening to this lie. On the day when I reached my breaking point my parents, sensing how massively stressed I was, sat down with me and asked how I was feeling. This wasn’t an easy conversation to have but my parents sympathy really helped me open up. Telling them was so freeing; I could feel the weight of the months and years of stress literally start to lift of my shoulders. This now wasn’t something I was going through alone. Without my parents support and reassurance I could have never resigned from my job or booked another doctor’s appointment. This time the appointment was with a different doctor who diagnosed me with depression and recommended starting anti-depressants and using talking therapies. Throughout this time of getting back onto my feet I was quite choked up at how everybody took the time to listen and help.,Making huge progress in dealing with my mental health I have lived more in the past eighteen months than I ever did before which has dramatically rebuilt my self-confidence and self-worth. My life isn’t going to be defined by mental illness. It’s no longer a dreadful prospect that bad days, things and thoughts will visit me. When they do I’ve found it useful to have a conversation with these thoughts and ask questions like “so how exactly have I messed everything up?” It’s strange to do this but by working out if these thoughts are true or not I can see how them for what they are: irrational and out of proportion.,Another one of my favourite quotes from Dead Poets Society (in a script which overflows with inspiring lines) is “carpe diem, seize the day, make your lives extraordinary”. The best piece of advice I can give to anybody living with anxiety and depression is find out what works for you and do whatever you have to do to make progress. Mental illness has a way of telling us that no matter what we do or how much we do it’s never enough. That’s just not true. What we’re doing is enough simply because we’re trying. Every step forward is such an achievement because we are becoming the amazing people we were created to be."
,"My mental health has been pretty up and down over the years and I still have quite bad anxiety and paranoia. At my lowest, I hit my absolute rock bottom and thought a lot about taking my own life. At that time I was convinced that keeping it to myself was the only thing that would help, when in reality, it was doing the opposite. With Dear You, I wanted to write a song that encouraged people to , and reach out because if you don't it can be fatal.,At first I didn’t feel I could talk to anyone. , has a way of making you feel completely alone. Depression makes it so that no matter what anyone says, you can hear it but you can't understand it. It's hard to explain to someone who doesn't know what it feels like. ,As soon as I realised what was happening I went to see a doctor and was prescribed medication. I was so closed off by that point that it didn’t occur to me to supplement the medication with a course of therapy, to try and get to the root causes of my ,, maybe even find a coping strategy.,Eventually I spoke to close friends and family but with depression it can be hard to articulate exactly what the problem is.,I genuinely found talking to close , helped so much. Talking about your problems is so therapeutic when people listen to you. The whole message of ‘Dear You’ is that people need to reach out to each other, and maybe if you tell one person how you feel, they might say they’re also feeling the same. Of course it depends who you speak to and how they respond, some people just don’t understand what depression is therefore don’t offer much help.,People have very different ideas of what depression is. It's funny how many people say things like ""well, you seemed alright yesterday!"" or ""just get over it"" without even knowing what they've said. To hear those things on a bad day can be fatal. ,I wrote this song 'Dear You' by using some of the dark parts of my life. I wanted to try and make talking about , and the prevention of it become the norm. ,I wanted to remind people that when you feel your worst and when you feel like you can't go on, there will be someone feeling very much the same who won't be very far away. Try your very best to reach out to them, even if it pulls you apart. ,At rock bottom they say there's only one way – up – but that isn't true. We all know the other way. ,Instead of offering those positive aphorisms or encouraging someone to feel better, ask them if they are OK. Say, ""How do you feel right now?"" and take it from there. ,We've got to stick together to make it better."
,"I am a wild, free spirit. I move countries more than I change my socks, and I chase the sun, the snowfall, and amazing opportunities. Yet for years now, people have been telling me, ‘Charmaine, you are just running away’. Firstly – travelling and my way of life is not ‘running away’, in fact, travelling helps me feel whole. People can be selfish; they can tell you that you are ‘running’ because they actually want you physically in their lives, next to them.,Tomorrow, tomorrow is the day I go back to England to see my doctor. Again. This is not goodbye to my lifestyle, more like ‘See you later’. I have been a resident of Spain now the past nine months, but I have just been so, overwhelmingly ill that going back to the country where my main doctor who speaks my language is seemed like a step in the right direction. I saw a doctor in Madrid, but with my broken Spanish I wrote up what I wanted to say and I handed him the letter. It was something along the lines of ‘, on this medication; I am coming off of it. Do you think it’s a good idea?’ Something told me that this wasn’t the greatest way to communicate this tragic thought. For some reason going back to the country I was born in feels like defeat, like I have lost. When you have lived in countries all over the world, you just understand and learn where your heart truly belongs, and my heart and soul is actually nowhere to be found in England, and is where I find I am at my lowest.,However, tomorrow. It has actually become so bad now that my mother forced me to book a flight back, and my grandparents are driving me to the airport to make sure I get on my plane. With everyone in my family believing this is the ‘right’ thing to do, I will try. I guess. I had no other option. I have , and ,, and it’s been haunting me for as young as I can remember. The toughest part is, my parents don’t understand it. I came out to my dad and told him everything a few months ago, and the reaction was extremely poor – it made me feel like I was completely alone. Like he had just ripped out my heart, and left me standing there alone. He was my best ,, yet he just doesn’t see depression as a ‘real’ issue. Why couldn’t he just wait and listen to what I had to say instead of covering his ears and pretending not to hear me?,My mum, an alcoholic, gets frustrated when I cry and tell her what's going on in my mind. Maybe she feels guilty? Maybe she wanted that perfect ‘girly girl’ daughter, to give her grandchildren, and paint her nails, and go for tea and cake in the sunshine... maybe I'm the reason she drinks? Maybe I have disappointed her? Both my mum and dad don’t want to know, and have never, ever helped or supported me through this whole time. They must have seen that I was , when I was 14 years old. They must have seen I was depressed, they must have heard, they must have felt it. So why didn’t they help me?,Even in the past few years before I really understood myself what was going on in my head, I would express to them how I felt. Nevertheless, I think it was much easier for them to turn away and ignore it. So many times I’ve heard ‘snap out of it’, ‘think positively’, ‘you are so moody’, ‘what have you got to be depressed about, you have food, you have shelter, you have family’, ‘you need to sort your mood swings out’. But NEVER have I heard them say ‘Let’s get you help’.,Anxiety and depression doesn’t just affect me, but the relationships around me. If I have ever hurt you, I am deeply sorry and I love you. However, although it looked like me who hurt you, it wasn’t me at all. My illness isn’t me, it doesn’t define who I am as a person. It just isn’t me.,When the day comes when I have children, I will acknowledge how they feel instead of sticking my head in the sand. I will love and adore every step they make in life, even if it’s away from me into a different country. I will always , at the end of the phone, even if it’s just to hear them cry. I will never be-little how they feel, and I will always, ALWAYS be there to hold their hand as their mother."
,"I'm 21 and starting my third year of university, though technically as I took a year out because of my illness, I am still a second year. I couldn't wait to move out of my home for first year so I could have so well-earned freedom. Throw a mental illness into the mix when you come home for the summer after this utter high of a year, and your life is turned upside down. From here, I first experienced stigma and discrimination.,When you are also juggling a mental illness, in my case mixed anxiety-depressive disorder, everyday tasks become so much harder. ""Lazy"" becomes a hurtful word. The standard lectures of ""oh come on, you haven't seen your dad's side of the family for so long. You're not experiencing anxiety, you just want to go upstairs for the sake of it"" and ""don't be so silly, you're not depressed, you're laughing!"" make you angry and the arguments start. Because you aren’t lazy, and you love your family but cannot stand in a room when your heart is racing and everyone wants to ask you questions and the walls are closing in. You are doing everything at your own pace to just get by.,At university, I have horrendous weeks where leave the washing up, forget to clean my teeth, don't remember to empty the bins, or pay bills. I forget to shower and my appetite is never regular. Friends can think I'm lazy, when in reality I am exhausted. When I don't want to go out, or even drink alcohol they say I'm ""boring and need to lighten up"". If I try to tell my parents that I need extra leeway because of what I am going through, they just chuck it back in my face and have a go at my for making excuses for not doing housework. They have no idea how much it hurts me - as most of the time I know things need to be done, but my depression prevents it. I have to sleep, I have to meditate, I have to pray.,When I go to lectures, my anxiety flares up and I can't stay. I skip lessons to get fresh air. I'm not truanting because I hate my subject, I am escaping an environment my body cannot stand being in. The way people react to knowing someone they love has a mental illness needs to change. I have started speaking more openly in the hope I can turn their opinions around.,I have faced stigma from family, from friends, from co-workers. You explain that sometimes you have to turn back when on a day out so you can rest, and you get yelled at for being ""unfit”. I am sorry if my body gets drained from panicking about the number of people in the shopping centre, or the lecture theatre. I am sorry that the constant emptiness inside me that weighs me down constantly means that I can snap out at you. My depression and anxiety are not excuses for me bailing. Mental illness is serious and I have to look after myself else I cannot be me. Having the courage to speak out and change the minds of those around you to get rid of stigma is challenging, but rewarding.,Stigma and discrimination around mental illnesses is disgraceful and needs to be destroyed. Would you tell a cancer-fighter that they need to snap out of it and get outside? Just because my illness is not visible, doesn't mean that I am not suffering. "

It affected my relationships with family and friends, I didn't want to socialise with anyone. My performance at school became worse, achieving lower exam grades and having poor attendance. Some days it would be a struggle even just to get myself out of bed. From depression, I would go into a hypermanic state, becoming quite careless of my well being and reckless, doing things which I would never think of doing in a well state. I was becoming quite a danger to myself.,Today I am mentally in a place I could never have imagined when I first became ill. I feel the strongest and healthiest I have ever been, working hard towards my dream career and looking forward to what the future holds. People said to me then that ""things would get better"" and that ""everything would be alright"". And I can now say that they weren't wrong.,For me personally, the thing which has helped most with my recovery is the great support I received from ,.,Mental illnesses can make people feel very isolated, especially if people around them are not so understanding or supportive. To listen, be patient and simply be kind are what I believe to be the most important things when caring for somebody dealing with mental health problems.,Finding hobbies which I enjoy has also helped with my recovery greatly. Whilst attending art therapy regularly during a stay in hospital, I discovered that this was a great way to express how I was feeling if words couldn't. Whether in a low or high mood, or if I'm feeling a bit angry, putting those feelings on paper in the form of a painting really helps me. I find that it can sometimes help me to share what's going on inside my mind with others, then they might get some more understanding of how I'm feeling., (GAD), depression and emotional dysregulation are some of the diagnoses I have been given over the past five years, with my latest diagnosis being , disorder. I believe that being diagnosed by a professional can be extremely helpful for some in order for them to get the correct treatment and to understand themselves better but it is not the most important thing. I remember feeling confused and scared when first diagnosed, thinking that it meant I would be unwell forever.,This was not, and is still not the case at all. Although the mental illness will always be there, I've learned that it is something which can be managed with the right support and that I am still able to live a very much happy and normal life.

The world appeared to be eating me up, the brightness of the sunlight diminishing into a grey, gloomy flat line, and I wasn’t even aware.,I thought I was weird, different, all I wanted was to fit in – although my desire to fit in only ruined me. Constantly I was reminded of the fact that everyone gets stressed, worried, gets anxious, it’s human nature. But what really nags at me is the fact that I was constantly told ‘it’s a bad day’, ‘it will be fine’, when in actual fact I wasn’t OK. Bad days last a day, not a week, not a month. They don’t consume you, eat you alive, stop you doing what you love!,Days, weeks, months passed and I was slowly but surely changing. I’d let the constant influx of ideas that bad days last only a few days completely encompass me to the point where I no longer lived in colour. That’s the problem, you see, with mental health stigma: you become a reject in society. Admitting to anyone that you have ,, generalised , disorder (GAD), an ,, was instant social suicide – something which I couldn’t afford to lose.

I didn’t do a massive “hello world, this is me”. I opened up to those who meant the most to me, the ones who really cared, people who I know that I needed in order to turn my life around. It wasn’t easy – it was terrifying – not knowing the reaction was something I couldn’t live with, I just didn’t know what to say. I spent weeks thinking of what to say, I went to therapy and got help composing an answer but I wanted it to be perfect. I never stood up and read a speech, I simply composed a text – sounds like the worst way to tell someone, but in actual fact it was the most rewarding experience.,The response was amazing. Being told to your face how much you mean to someone isn’t as rewarding to me, because being told in words which you can always look back on and read in moments of loss is a gift so small yet empowering. ,, ‘how you doing?’, ‘you alright?’, and basic smiles, made it so much easier for me to get back and be the person I used to be.,The stigma around mental health is something which NEEDS to be broken. Categorising someone because of a fact you found out – or in the worst cases because they told you – doesn’t make it easier. Changing your personality around someone who has a mental health condition doesn’t do them any favours. Having a mental health condition doesn’t mean I’m dangerous, as it’s portrayed by media – if anything, without your support the person I’m the biggest danger to is myself."
,"Admitting ,is an illness and not something that's my fault in some way or another is hard. After all who really wants to admit they're ill with something that's all in your head. With most illnesses, it’s a different matter, people can see it, they understand it - people are sympathetic. People don't understand depression, they just think it's just something you need to get over and cheer up. Life can't be that bad, surely! I mean, depression means you’re weak and crazy - this doesn't happen to normal people right?,
 ,
Even saying the word out aloud or writing it down on a piece of paper, the same way you write any other word, doesn't make it seem any more real. But it is! I'm ill with depression, I didn't ask for it to happen to me but it has. Truth is, I think I've been suffering with it far longer than I've been officially diagnosed. I still remember the day I sat in front of the doctor with my sister, admitting I couldn't cope and asking for help. Without the silence that exists around mental health problems, maybe I would have ,
 ,
Most days it's torment in my head even if I’m smiling and laughing - it's there trying to creep in. It's hard trying to explain what it feels like to other people, a dark cloud descends and it's like fighting a war with yourself. People say try to look at the positives in your life, they don't understand you really are trying your best and it's on those days you're fighting your hardest. Some days it's got so bad, you just ,
 ,
Depression has to some degree taken more from me than I've taken from it. It's changed me into a person I don't like and at times have loathed. I feel I've ruined friendships and have said some things I can't undo. I feel guilty for bothering people with my problems, being a burden is on no one’s wish list. To those people I'm deeply sorry, please forgive me and please don't hate, without you there as a friend I won't have anything to keep fighting for. Above all, please be patient - I will find a way to pay you back for your kindness and support. It's no easy task supporting someone with depression but at times like this you find out ,, I hope to be able to know these people for the rest of my life.,
 ,
I'm scared I'll always feel this way and people will eventually see me, the same way I see myself at the moment. I still have some way to go to accepting my illness and moving forward to a better place, and to do that I need other people to be accepting, to be patient, and not to jump to conclusions about what I’m going through."
," in men is one of the greatest problems of our time and yet one of the least talked about topics. What many don’t realise is that suicide is the leading cause of death in men under 50 despite the fact twice as many women get diagnosed with depression. Just have a little think about those two facts for a few seconds. It’s not cancer, or road accidents, or some other topic the media loves to run with like global warming that is killing men, it’s suicide.,The trouble is that ‘suicide’ and ‘mental health’ aren’t sexy topics that the tabloids can print on their front pages with some terrible pun of a headline to churn out copies. They want stories that sell. They want to talk about Trump’s hair or Kim Kardashian’s latest nude selfie, and all the while the male suicide rate sits quietly in the background, as big a problem as ever but overshadowed by the irrelevance that gets printed and Tweeted. But this isn’t a problem that we can simply sweep under the rug and let it be dealt with by someone else. ,The problem is with masculinity. Men are traditionally, and archaically, seen as the ‘breadwinners’, the strong ones who support their family while the ‘stay at home mother’ looks after the kids. But life just isn’t like that anymore. While there are still issues of inequality throughout the world, we see women striving to break through the stereotypes in place by achieving great things, but we don’t see this same commitment from men to opening up.,Very few men like to admit their feelings or emotions or show any sign of weakness. They fear that once they open up they will be seen as less masculine and weak. They’re thinking like the primates we once were; “Who will want to marry me if I talk about my feelings?! Does talking about depression make me a woman? Does writing about my own experiences with suicide make me any less of a man?"" Of course not, and the people who think it does need to pull themselves out of the time warp from 600 years ago and get with the 21st Century. ,Suicide needs to be spoken about on two fronts. ,Firstly, the media. The media loves talking about the Zika Virus, or Ebola, or whatever other Walking Dead-esque disease it is that they can scare the population with. I’m not saying these issues aren’t important, but more talk about suicide could have a huge impact. This doesn’t mean giving a newspaper column to any “I was on TV once, please listen to me, please!” ‘celebrity’ like Katie Hopkins who, despite never suffering from depression, once wrote on the topic that “People with depression do not need a doctor and a bottle of something that rattles. They need a pair of running shoes and fresh air”. Ah damn, if only I’d bought a new pair of running shoes I could have saved myself two years of depression, thanks Dr. Hopkins! It’s not okay that people with a , are allowed to comment on issues they have no understanding of, especially when these are issues people are physically taking their own lives over.,Secondly, we need to have a ,. Let the men that you are friends with know that they can be honest with you, about anything, and it won’t change your relationship. If your sole aim in life is to be a group of ‘top lads’, know that this is still possible by being open and emotional. Being honest about what you’re going through makes you so much more of a man than you may know, because it takes real courage to stand up and say something when the chips may be stacked against you. If we start a greater conversation around suicide, do away with the stigma and let men know that it’s okay to admit how they’re really feeling, they will seek the help they need. We all have a responsibility to tackle the silence that leads to suicide. ,If you’re struggling, open up to someone. Suicide and depression feed off the secrets, and one conversation can kick-start recovery in a way you might think impossible; it did with me. And if you know someone who has or may have ,, don’t be afraid to talk about it – it could save their life. "
,"Just because you can't see or feel it doesn't mean it don't exist. , is a silent killer.,I'm 26 and suffered with mental illness most of my life, mainly with ,which took over my life at times and mild depression where I was able to cope with it until just under two years ago when it all changed.,I don't want to go into too many details about what happened to me that triggered it off, but I'd hit rock bottom and I honestly couldn't see myself coming back from it, even people I loved thought I was gone.,I'd never imagined myself to , but that's what I started to do, I wanted to punish myself for feeling this low about life.,Shortly after my friend knocked on my door to see how I was doing, I tried to hide it from him, but he started asking questions. I'd never been in this situation before and I'm sure my friend hadn't either. This was my first experience of someone who was close to me seeing me suffer through my mental illness.,I deteriorated dramatically for two months after this and without my friends and family I don't think I would be here now. With different people I would react differently with them. I pushed my family away like my mum, brother and step dad, I didn't want them near me. With my friends I felt more comfortable but with only certain people, the most important thing was they were there.,I remember Christmas Eve, my work mates came to see me and tried talking sense into me but I sat there staring at the tv with no emotion. The more they spoke the more I zoned out, until I finally broke down in tears and cried for hours non stop. I literally didn't know what or where I was in life, I didn't know what to do. By being there for me, they started to realise how depression worked and that you can't just tell someone to get better.,When I finally went back to work I was broken, I had no energy, I could only work for four hours a day as my body and mind was that weak. , told me that what he went through with me made him understand mental illness a lot and he learnt a lot from my situation. I know a lot of people have really bad experiences of talking about ,, so this was a big positive. ,I found that different people react differently with you, some distance themselves from you, other are too pushy and ask you loads of questions and then you have the people who sit there and listen. None of them are right or wrong, it's just how people deal with it. For me, knowing they all had the same intentions of helping me get better meant the world. ,Running and boxing have helped too, I had a fight back in February, lost in a split decision but in my head I felt like I'd won the world title because I had achieved what I set out to do "
,"Three years ago, I lost my voice. I could still say what I was expected to, say what people wanted me to, say whatever I was told to, but I couldn’t seem to find my voice. I could say whatever anyone needed me to, anyone but me. My voice had been almost silenced by the people around me. I was made quieter by the people who called me selfish, the people who thought I was weak, the people who convinced me I wasn’t worth their time or energy, all because of my worsening mental health. I was made quieter by the people who doubted the credibility of my mental health problems and by the people who doubted my credibility because of them.,During the five years before that, my mental health had slowly deteriorated, starting with unexplainable indescribable sadness, and ,, onto hours of crying, and the start of obsessions and compulsions that would soon start to take over my life. After three years of suffering, of not realising that life wasn’t supposed to be this way, I sought help. Over the next two years, I talked to ,, a policeman, some ,, who had nothing for me but discrimination based on preconceptions they’d formed about what it meant to have mental health problems. I ended up discharging myself from local mental health services, because I couldn’t deal with my worsening mental health and the chance of facing any more cruelty. A few months later, voiceless and lost, I saw a tweet about becoming a Time to Change Young Champion. I disregarded any trepidation I had and signed up to be part of the Time to Change young person’s panel.,When I attended my first meeting three years ago, I didn’t know what to expect. I had no confidence left in what I had to say, but that didn’t matter; it was a space free of judgement and ridicule. Both young people and staff, those that I met that day, and at every training, and event since, have shown nothing but respect and kindness to me and all the other young people. I continued attending various training sessions, from media training, and training on speaking out, to training to help me to deliver my personal testimony, each one starting to give me my voice back, starting to convince me that I had something to say worth listening to. I’ve been able to put my training to good use at events, from joining Time to Change in several schools at events, talking to students while they wrote pledges and watched the campaign videos, to sitting on the panel at a ,.,More recently, as part of being a Young Champion, I’ve been delivering my personal testimony in schools around the South, to groups of between eight teachers, to anywhere around 100 students. I share the story of what it feels like to experience anxiety and become so convinced you are being poisoned that you eat sealed food for months, of how I ended up being sectioned and spent five weeks in hospital recovering. I share the story of how I made it through and of how far my family and friends have come in understanding what I’m going through and being supportive. Some of the worst moments of my life were somehow made into positives, from the first time I gave my testimony, and a student came to talk to me at the end, because it was “so nice to finally talk to someone that understood”, to every other student and teacher who has intently listened.,Since becoming a Young Champion, when I face discrimination I now know that I have something important to say, something worth listening to and that I deserve better. Three years on, not only is my voice louder, it’s made stronger with all the others who have the same message to share as me. Together we can change attitudes to improve ,’s understanding of mental health problems. Our stories are all different but each one powerful in its own ways, each one making a difference, each one making me feel honoured to share the title of Young Champion with them."
,"I have suffered from major , disorder and general , disorder for the last few years. I am slowly recovering. I now want to open up about my struggles, in order to show young people that it’s okay not to be okay. I think it is especially hard on young males; they have a perception that they need to be strong and brave. I think the world needs a real change. Luckily I am still here today to talk about these issues.,We are getting to a place where people are able to open up a lot more. But not we’re quite there yet. Young people are affected by this on a daily basis – as we can see in the staggering , rates. Yet we still do not have the resources to help people immediately in need.,I was lucky enough to have supportive people in my life. A loving family. Lucky enough to gain the skills and maturity to battle these illnesses. Lucky enough to still be here today, able to open up about my struggles. Unfortunately, at the time, my demons took over, I lost friends, isolated myself, self harmed, abused alcohol; I was living someone else’s life. A life that wasn’t my own.,I began my recovery through medication and counselling. A well balanced system that worked for me. I stuck out counselling for almost two years, on and off. It helped me to grow strength and build back up my confidence.,I am in a much better place now. There are still bad days. But they come and go. I am happy – I put on a front. I socialise, I laugh, I smile, I live. But this doesn’t mean I am indestructible. I am vulnerable and still battle EVERY DAY.,This is what people need to realise: We do not know what is going on in people’s lives; what’s happening in their minds. For me – it was as simple as a chemical imbalance in the mind. That was all it took to change my life forever. It was out of the blue, and it completely took over me, changed me. I wish when I was that young, hurting, fearing for my life, that somebody had noticed. I wish someone knew the change I was going through. I wanted a hand to hold. Luckily I realised I needed help and opened up.,But that’s not the case for everyone.,I want to live in a world where we stop judging, where we stop criticising and tearing each other apart with every little mistake; where everyone who experiences a mental health problem can turn to their ,without fear. I promised myself I will fight in every way to help make this possible. In a way, I am glad I have gone through this experience. It matured me and made me so much stronger. I have gained the strength to be able to open up.,Now I want to pass my strength to the people who need that hand to hold in their dark times. We need to stand together and gain confidence to speak out! In every dark time there is a bright light. Never give up. Never surrender. Never lose hope."
,"I’m so tired of being judged by people who know nothing about mental health. Imagine a life where people say “you’re a drama queen”, “over protective”, “crazy”, “not normal”, “unsocial”, “you hate people”, “you make life worst than it is…”. And “get over it, nothing’s wrong”, “everyone has a bad day, stop playing the victim”, “here’s a tiny violin”. “You’re horrible”. “You’re mental”.,Then think, why would you do that? What would make you choose a life where that is how you want people to see you?,Answer? ,I experience borderline , (BPD), , (which started at age 11), ,, agoraphobia for five years, , and I’m a past ,. Due to over medicating and not having a health and safety plan in place, BPD has nearly killed me multiple times. But we are stronger than the impulses, we can fight this. We aren’t manipulative, or at least I personally don’t come across that way. We aren’t dangerous, but the media makes it out that if you have a mental health issue you’re likely to hurt someone. NO, we aren’t, if anything we’re more at risk, and more sensitive to other people’s pain.,BPD is a medical condition. Even doctors get mental health wrong, so we need to study and understand it more. We aren’t broken, we are just different. When people say “be normal”, I fight back and say “define normal” – what’s normal for most isn’t for me.,The thing is, most people, “normal people”, see the world as it is. We don’t. My world, my life, people, events, anything and everything, have never felt real. The reason why I’m more internet public and enjoy being alone 24/7 is because...I’m terrible with people unless they need help or want something.,I hate eye contact. It freaks me out. I overanalyse. I care too much; I turn into a councillor. I can’t choose to live in reality so everything seems more intense all the time. Everything is a movie or soap because I’m detached from EVERYTHING.,I can look at myself in a mirror and have no idea who that person looking back is. I can stare at my hands or hurt myself and not feel a thing because my body doesn’t seem real. Test it: Get your phone, walk around the house and film at eye level, then watch it back. People are actor’s, events are story plots. That’s how I interpret the world.,Nothing seems real if I’m happy. If someone is being nice, then I know it will get ripped away from me like a plot twist. A simple task such as picking something up has five questions behind why I want to or need to before I even do it. Life consists of always looking over my shoulder. Worried over nothing but it’s always there. Fearing every little thing. Phone rings…who died? What’s wrong? Police? These thoughts race through my mind within seconds.,Expecting the worst is easier than having the good then taken away. If I know it’s coming then nothing needs to turn off I can cope otherwise bad news.,How many times do you think I HAVE TRIED TO CHANGE? I hate this so much.,I overanalyse because it helps put a perspective on things because I can’t do it straight away, I have to know why that was said. Was the purpose good or bad? What’s hidden in the subtext, why did you choose me to tell? How am I supposed to respond in away a “normal” person would?,So when you say, “OMG she’s crazy!” I’m fully aware that I have a mental illness; I can deal with that, and I can’t change it – but you CAN change your attitude. I’m not dangerous so either deal with it too or leave my life.,I know life isn’t a movie, I know people are real, I know eyes aren’t camera’s, I’m aware I’m not on the Truman Show – but it feels like it to me. Not everyone is “normal”. Normal is an illusion. What is normal for the spider is chaos for the fly.,So: Don’t judge or run; embrace, help and , Everyone asks “how are you?” but god forbid you answer with the truth – some people don’t care about your answer unless there’s something in it for them. I’m not like those people, so if I ask, it’s because I care and won’t judge.,I’m not a victim to life, I’m not looking for anyone to care or help. I just want people to know that they’re lucky not to be trapped in a world that doesn’t seem real. So stop judging those of us who have mental health problems, and start supporting them. Just because it’s in the head doesn’t mean it’s not real to the person experiencing it. Just because you can’t see a bandage doesn’t mean it’s not important. "
,"I was twelve years old and I remember the day as if it only happened yesterday. Me and my dad had just come out of The Book Shop in St John’s Precinct, Liverpool, and we decided to sit down in the canteen whilst we were waiting on my Mum and to sister to finish their shopping. He took out the book he just bought me which was Harry Potter and the order of Phoenix which I still haven’t read to this day (so for that I apologise dad!) although the message on the front page I read over and over again. ,
The message reads “It’s easy to criticise, but it’s hard to understand” written in black pen by my dad, Eddie Herbert. At the time he wrote that message and explained it’s meaning, I wasn’t aware that he was suffering with depression. Sadly, two years later, in March 2006, he lost his battle with depression and took his own life and it was when dealing with his loss, that I fully understood the message he was telling me. ,The message was that we can easily criticise a person, however, until we know the full story, we will never understand what it is they are going through. The message he told fits perfectly with depression and I take his words and share them with those who read this article in the hope that by the end of it, they have a better understanding of depression and the effects it has on the individual. ,“Suicide is selfish”, “How can they be depressed when they have all that money”, “Just deal with it”. It is sad that in a world where so many lives our lost due to depression, these quotes are said so frequently. Therefore I am going to take each one of those quotes and explain why these are incorrect in the hope that it will change people’s perceptions of depression. ,– Suicide is not a selfish act, it is often the only option a person feels they have when their depression has overpowered them. Many people believe it to be selfish as they have left their loved ones behind; however a depressed person might feel that, by taking their own life, they will be a burden off their shoulders. So, in this sense, suicide is actually an act of unselfishness. They are doing what they feel is right for them and their family. It’s easy to criticise and say suicide is selfish, but it’s hard to understand why they do it until you know the full story. , – Robin Williams, Gary Speed, Robert Enke. These are just three names out of a number of famous people who took their own life due to depression. The message it tells us is that no matter what people may think money doesn’t buy happiness. Anyone in the world can be affected by depression whether you have £5 to your name or £5 million to your name. If you ask any famous people who have suffered with depression whether they would give up everything they had to overcome depression the answer you would get is yes. Spending X amount of money won’t help a person overcome depression, having people around them and getting the help required will. It’s easy to criticise rich and famous people who have depression, but unless you know the reasons why, it’s hard to understand. , – Telling a person who suffers with depression to deal with it, is the same as telling a person who suffers with cancer to deal with it. Many people may disagree with me by saying cancer is a serious illness, however so is depression and it’s that message we need to get across. Yes, many lives our lost to cancer but many lives our lost to depression too. It is the leading cause of death of men under the age of 50. That alone should be enough for us to end the stigma surrounding depression and ensure more is done for those suffering. It’s easy for us to criticise someone we know and tell them to deal with whatever is going on in their life but unless we are living in their shoes, it’s hard for us to understand. ,By giving a brief explanation on these three quotes regarding depression, the message my dad told is quite clear. Rather than jump to conclusions and criticise people, we should take a step back and put ourselves in their shoes. Unless we know exactly what it is going on their life, it is hard for anyone but them to understand."
,"I grew up in a home where , were present, yet no-one ever explained to me what was going on. My mother would frequently disappear, sometimes I witnessed when they came to get her to be sectioned. Father and I would later visit her in 'hospital'. It was clear to me, that it was not an ordinary hospital: no-one looked particularly ill, there were no drips or bandages and no-one was in bed. I never had an explanation as to why my mother was there. No-one told me what was wrong with her. I felt frightened and worried for my mother. Why was she taken away from home? What was the place she was taken to? Was it my fault? Had my mother done something wrong? Was this a punishment?,While I had grown used to my alcoholic father's inability to provide me with a convincing explanation to almost anything, what I still struggle with decades later, is the response from the ,. They must have know that I existed, yet I do not remember one conversation, where anyone would have at least attempted to explain the situation. I felt utterly alone and scared, abandoned even. Invisible.,There were whispers in the neighbourhood: ""with a mother like that, she must be damaged"". They were taking about me. Someone had daubed ""Heli's mother is mad"" under our balcony. The caretaker of the flats we lived in made me scrub it out. I still remember the stinging sense of injustice. It was not my fault, nor was it mother's. She was not mad, she was my mum and I loved her. I was about six.,As I became older, I realised that what happened at home was not normal. Other children's mothers did not just disappear without explanation. I also realised that my mother's behaviour was somewhat unusual, sometimes erratic, often very intense. She would accuse neighbours of making noise in the night to disturb her, of being able to control her body temperature and trying to electrocute her. Even my young mind could tell, that this was not ordinary behaviour.,I had an older friend whose father was a mental health nurse. One day she said: ""So your mother is in a mental hospital"". Finally! The place had a name. Yet at the same time I sensed that this was still a taboo subject, too shameful to talk about.,When I was a teenager, I accidentally came across papers that had my mother's diagnosis on them. ,, in bold letters. I did not want to know. After all, this was what I had been bullied about at school for years. This was about my mother's mental health, a subject so shameful, that even my own father was incapable of talking about it. This is how I grew up. Uninformed, ashamed and completely unequipped to support my mother in her struggles. Such was the ,, that I was determined not to end up like her.,About a year and half ago, I was diagnosed with severe , with , symptoms. Nothing made sense; I did not know what was real and what was not. I was certain that everyone was ridiculing me. It was utterly frightening. This was what I had tried to avoid all my life. Was I becoming my mother?,I am convinced that, had I been better informed about my mother's illness, I would have not been ashamed of seeking help for myself and not become so unwell, that I had no choice, but was sectioned. Overall, I have been very lucky and have mostly been treated very well, but please, please, do not bury your head in the sand, if you have a family member with mental illness. Make the effort to talk about it.,, explain, that mental illness is an illness like any other and deserves the same amount of empathy and understanding, as a physical illness. It really is time to talk."
,"My story began eight years ago but only really became clear to me three years ago, after I had a heart attack.,Eight years ago, I lost my mum to cancer and my nephew to meningitis within two weeks of each other. I was grieving, but there was more going on that that. I wouldn't speak to anyone about how I was feeling and I became more and more isolated. I was scared that if I told people what I was feeling or what I was going through, they wouldn't understand. I was trying to earn a wage to pay the bills and had I young children, I didn't want them worrying about their dad.,Being a male, I decided to bury my head in the sand and carry on regardless. Spending a lot of time on my own, working more hours to keep myself busy and out of the house. My family thought I was grumpy and moody as I was always snapping at people. In reality I was slipping into , and couldn't speak to anyone. I didn't want my bosses thinking I couldn't do my job, I was a manager running a busy sales office. I needed my job. ,Work was becoming more and more stressful as targets where getting harder to achieve. I didn't pass on the stress to my staff and soaked up more and more, becoming , on a regular basis. I was worrying about debts, so everything was getting on top of me. I still didn't speak to anyone. I didn't really understand , but in my mind I was scared of admitting that I had a problem. I was definitely self stigmatising.,Eventually everything came to a head and I had a heart attack. The doctors can't say for sure that stress and anxiety caused it but that it was a definite factor as I had no other risk factors. My blood pressure and cholesterol were both normal. My poor mental health eventually affected my physical health.,At first I again tried to deal with this on my own but soon realised I needed help. I visited my doctor who suggested medication, but I didn't want tablets! We discussed counseling and decided CBT was the way forward. I had six sessions which helped massively. I left my job and spoke to my , about how I was feeling and what had been going on. Talking about it and facing my problems definitely helped me to come to terms with everything.,Now I speak to groups of people with Time to Change about my story in the hope I can help other people. I've realised , is the most powerful tool I have. It helps other people, but it is self-help for me too, as I never hide away or get myself isolated, and never forget what stigmatising myself caused.,The best piece of advice I can give is to speak out. Especially men. Don't hide away, because you may not be as lucky as me. I came out the other side, but I may have not!"
,"After holding this in for the last 19 years of my life I think I’m finally imploding. Not because it’s my family’s dirty little secret. We are not ashamed. But people just don’t need to know and most don’t want to know and that’s fine. I’ve had it happen so many times over the years where my friends, even teachers, have asked me “What’s wrong? You can tell me anything” but then I’ve watched them feel awkward and shy away after I tell them. That’s the stigma and that’s fine - I still love them.,The thing is, if I could tell people my mum had been in a car crash, or had a heart attack or any other physical injury then people could understand. They’d send flowers and they’d ask how we are and friends and family might even visit. But my mum hasn’t been in a car crash, her heart is perfectly healthy and on the outside she is perfectly fine - give or take a couple of scars. My Mum has depression, an invisible disease that causes unimaginable amounts of pain and suffering unbeknown to the people that surround her because there is no pain there for them to see. But I see it, and my brothers and sister see it, and my Mum feels it.,This illness weighs down on her like a house balancing on a brick. And sometimes she breaks. When my Mum is ill, she’s alone. That’s what she thinks. She’s alone and it’s her fault and she’s our burden. But that’s not true; my mum is not alone. She isn’t alone because my four siblings, my stepdad and I are there with her. She can’t see us but we are there always in her head with her. I have spent years trying to figure it out with her - even though to her it feels like nobody is there, trying to get through to her that she’s not alone.,Although she doesn’t know it yet, my Mum outsmarted this disease a long time ago. I’ve seen it myself. In the past it was uncontrollable and it consumed her but now, oblivious to her own strength, she controls it. We know now that when she is ill she will get better. She catches the illness in time before it takes over, but sometimes it still manages to steal parts of her. My mum is not a burden; you never have been and you never will be. I watch Andrew, the youngest of us all, tell Mum that her broken head will be fixed, and I am proud. My Mum is the Sun of our family, we orbit around her, and if she doesn’t shine neither do we. We are one and the same. We will try and try again until she finds her light and she shines so bright that I watch everyone she meets fall for her irrevocably kind personality.,My Mum is special, she has given us the best childhood anyone could ask for. The gathering of leaves and conkers in the Autumn, the father’s day outings where she attended as the only Mum so we wouldn’t be left out, the hundreds of books she still buys me because there is a beauty in losing yourself in a book and she always understood that. For teaching us to be open minded and kind and strong. My Mum has depression, but depression will never have my Mum., "
,"As a student nurse I encounter mental health issues on a daily basis, however I have been carrying my own secret for years. At the age of 15 I was diagnosed with , and placed on anti-depressants. We have a family history of , and , with my Nan undergoing ECT. I remember my GP telling me ‘you won’t end up like nan, this will be short term’.,Twelve years later, I am still on anti-depressants. Through this time, I found myself ‘coasting’ with my medication as accepting that ‘this is as good as it gets’. Only when starting my training did I realise that it didn’t need to be like this. I went to my GP and he referred me to the community mental health team to see a specialist, the first one I’d seen in 10 years since my original diagnosis. He diagnosed me with resistant depression and ,. For the first time I felt my condition was finally being taken seriously and it was something that could be treated.,I also become more , about my illness. I had my medication changed and additional medication added in. This was done just before my first placement of my second year. Not only did I have to deal with the stress of placement (37.5 hours a week on placement, uni work and a part time job), I was suffering side effects from my medication, nausea and dizziness mainly. I did not let this stop me and was open with my mentor and she was very supportive. Once again I felt I was finally being taken seriously.,On a different placement I then encounter another issue: night shifts. My mood is very dependent on my sleep pattern, I take medication at night which causes drowsiness. I became very stressed about this and discussed it with my doctor and tutor at uni. I’m required to do at least one night shift on my training in order to qualify. I decided to try it, so I spoke to my mentor and explained – I said I was on medication and so on. Her response was ‘well what medication?’ I felt this was very personal to me but explained anyway. I said I was happy to do a ‘twilight’ shift in which I would start at 7pm and leave around 2am her response was ‘no you do all the shift, or not at all’.,I was shocked. I couldn’t help thinking that if I had a physical condition this wouldn’t have been an issue. I was left feeling humiliated and shamed. I carried on with my shift and something else happened, something small, and I just broke down. I felt like this was a huge set back – for the first time in my training I felt the full force of the , of mental health problems. I was most shocked that this came from a nurse. How could they not be more accommodating of a serious health condition? This type of attitude is damaging to people who experience mental health problems, and to the nursing profession as a whole.,I am nowhere near the end of my mental health story and I know I will have set backs throughout my nursing career. Sometimes I wish I had a long term physical condition as it would be easier to explain. However, although depression doesn’t define me, it is a huge part of me – and surviving this has made me a stronger. It has also helped me become a better nurse, and hopefully I’ll help reduce mental health stigma along the way."
,"So here’s my story, a 30 year old in a modern world. Diagnosed with , in 2012, after the passing of my nan which threw me into turmoil. I had spent many years battling with doctors, and medical professionals for nearly 10 years. Diagnosed with depression at the age of 17 I was always certain it was more than this, inside I felt different I knew I was somehow different to everyone else. I saw the world in a completely different light, often with a much deeper understanding and very much an over thinker. I spent much of my teenage years often confused about how I was feeling, or often confused at the way I would behave and react to certain situations.,I spent much of my time asleep for hours battling severe tiredness, to which I could never control. To suddenly having so much energy I was completing 20 hour shifts at work. I would experience highs and being the most energetic happiest person in the room, to suddenly spending my time in my room planning my funeral because I couldn’t comprehend being alive. I would go from being happy go lucky, to suddenly being the most angry and violent person in the room for often no reason at all. As a teenager I really couldn’t understand the reason for my behaviour, and often just thought it was a ‘phase’ and something I would grow out of.,Then came the passing of my nan in 2012 – it hit me with such a bang my whole world turned upside down. I began behaving as I did when I was a teenager, the highs the lows and the real lack of any sense of what I was actually doing. Until one day my manager came to me and sat me down, clearly she knew something was wrong. I'd worked for her for two years so she had seen my decline, and finally decided to step in and see what was going on. She had explained that my behaviour was really starting to show, turning up late for work, often being aggressive, to some days being so over the top people assumed I was on drugs. At this point I broke down and explained I had been like this most of my life and opened up about my ,, she then said she was going to make a phone call to which she did. ,She returned ten minutes later having made an appointment at the local mental health centre, she asked me to go along and speak to someone to which I agreed. It was then I was diagnosed with Bipolar type 2, severe anxiety disorder and OCD. Finally I had a diagnosis but this was just the start of my journey. For the last four years I have experienced the rollercoaster of what its like to have a mental illness in a modern world, often spending vast amounts of time waiting for answers, appointments or for people to truly show an understanding of how it really feels to live with a mental illness on a daily basis. I think in a modern world with the technology we have, people assume that mental illness is something that can be cured by a magic pill. They can cure nasty diseases like cancer so surely they can cure a little bit of sadness in a person right?,Having bipolar I have learnt many things about myself as an individual; it has also made me feel more empathy towards people who experience other really difficult things on a daily basis. But there’s one thing I am still yet to comprehend and that’s peoples lack of understanding or empathy towards someone with a mental health problem. Also the lack of understanding at how something so little can make a massive difference in a person’s life, ,. The lack of understanding in the workplace is equally as important, when I was at the lowest point in my life I was dismissed from a job because of the way I was rather than them make reasonable adjustments to make my life a little easier.,If you know someone with a mental health problem don't shut them out, don’t feel like you can’t open up and ask them how they are feeling. Don’t feel ashamed or embarrassed to talk about it with them, understanding can go a long way in someone’s recovery. "
,"I had worked in architecture for over twenty-five years and have suffered from , for the last six. During that time I worked for two different architects practices in Bristol and have to say that the attitudes of both companies differ greatly.,The first firm I worked for could not have done more to help me deal with the illness as it ebbed and flowed in the two years I worked there and was fortunate enough to have a HR manager who had herself suffered from depression.,However the four years I was with the second firm could not have been more different. From the outset I felt that my depression was in remission (mainly due to the care, support and understanding of my previous employer) and therefore felt no need to make any mention of this when I started work. As the years passed I noticed that there were people in the firm who had problems with stress and depression but sadly they were put in a position where they were in effect made to feel quite unwelcome by the management and duly left or were made redundant at the first possible opportunity. As you can imagine having seen this happen I was now even more unwilling to disclose anything about my condition which by now had become worse, due mainly to the toxic environment I was working in.,It was only towards the end of 2011 that I was signed off by my GP for two weeks with stress. When I returned to work it became obvious that I was going to get the same treatment as the others as my workload was gradually diminished, my confidence systematically undermined, unfounded accusations made and at my annual appraisal I was told that I was no longer trusted and also questions were asked about my mental stability. This duly culminated in me being made redundant at the end of May 2012. Having been told that the reason was due to me being untrustworthy, although no direct reference was made to my illness. In addition to this I do know for a fact that HR made a point of checking whether there would be any problem about making me redundant on the grounds of ','.,This whole process of my redundancy nearly ended in me committing suicide, but for timely intervention of a friend who referred me to my GP who in turn put me in contact with the local NHS Crisis Team. Although the firm went to extreme lengths to ensure that on paper me being made redundant was not as a result of my depression, both the previous experience of what had happened to others with the same condition and the inconsistency of the evidence they presented, clearly pointed at least circumstantially to the fact that my illness was the reason for my removal.,However I have now changed careers and moved well away from architecture as this industry was I believe at least in part responsible for making my depression worse. Thankfully my current employer takes a more enlightened approach to mental health issues and supports those who suffer from such problems. I'm speaking up to show , just how devastating , against people with mental health problems can be, and just how far a little understanding can go."
,"I wonder how much , is all in our minds.,I say that with love, because I know how mental illness can make us think the worst of every situation. Goodness knows, I’m guilty of that.,But after months and months of , – depression that had encompassed hospital admissions, severe self-harm and four significant suicide attempts – I decided to come clean.,I’d spent 18 months taking my children to school and standing on my own in the most distant corner of the playground, too unwell to even contemplate talking to anyone.,I had been hospitalised four times after attempting to end my life, and needed treatment many more times for my self-inflicted wounds.,I was so, so ashamed.,I’m not entirely sure what prompted me to come clean. A few very near and dear friends knew how I was feeling, and had been amazingly, unfailingly supportive, even turning up to hold my hand in hospital – but to the wider world, I was still under wraps.,But I’d been , my way through mental illness, and for some reason, one day, I decided I’d had enough of trying to hide my depression. I posted a link to my blog on Facebook.,I went to bed as soon as I’d shared the link, afraid to see what the fallout would be. But when I checked in the following morning, I had 75 comments on my post.,Some of them were commending my honesty and bravery (not that I felt brave). Some were confessing that they were struggling with mental health problems too. Every single one of them was positive.,That didn’t seem a lot like stigma to me.,Since I opened up about my illness, the vast majority of people have been so very kind. I’ve had messages of support, offers to meet up for coffee and cake, unexpected gifts to try to put a smile on my face.,It has made depression so much easier to bear.,It’s also helped immensely to know that even if people don’t understand completely, they at least know why I am the way I am. I’ve struggled enormously with the thought that people must think that I’m aloof, stuck up, rude; now they know that it’s not that I don’t want to talk to them, or to join in with nights out, but because I can’t.,Over the past month or so, I’ve felt a lot better than I have for a long time. I can’t say it’s entirely because I spoke out about being unwell; I think a change of medication can claim most of the credit. But putting down the burden of secrecy, and receiving so much support and encouragement from so many people, has most certainly played a part.,I realise now that I wasn’t keeping quiet about my depression because I thought people would judge me, but because I was judging myself. I was ashamed to admit to being unwell.,Maybe when we can stop stigmatising ourselves, we’ll discover that actually, the world is more sympathetic to mental illness than we ever realised. I hope that one day everyone will have such understanding towards people with mental health problems, as I now know the impact it can have. "
,"I was diagnosed with severe , and , in late 2012 after being sexually assaulted by a friend. Prior to this, it had taken me two years to come to terms with what had actually happened and accept the fact that I needed help. I confided in family and applied to see a counsellor.,When the event first occurred, I struggled to leave the house for fear of triggers being set off in the outside world. On occasion, I struggled to even stay on buses due my anxiety.,Whilst it’s true that my family and my counsellor were fantastic , networks, there were still some details which I didn’t feel comfortable sharing with them. My loved ones had already seen me suffer so much, and after an attempt to take my life – I tried my best to protect them from future harm.,There was one person though, who I knew I could talk to. A friend of mine for 4 years (at the time) had always been attentive and non-judgemental and I found myself discussing things with him before I’d even talked about them with my counsellor. It helped that Will lived over 30 miles away, meaning that the majority of our conversations were had over the phone, in the darkness of my own room where I felt safe.,In time, we grew closer and not only did I reveal secrets, but Will also confessed things to me he had never told anyone else. We realised that anxiety was an issue for both of us, and although he had no experience of depression – he was extremely patient and supportive of my issues. ,Eventually, my anxiety decreased and I was able to go out more. As my confidence grew however, my counselling came to an end and I became fearful that I would relapse into low moods once more. Instead of bottling things up like I had in the past however, I confided in Will and he was able to show me that I was stronger than I knew, and I realised that he would always be there for me to , to.,Will and I are now a couple, we have been together for a year and I am happier than I have been for years. Will has also grown a great deal during our journey, and I genuinely feel like we add something important to the others life. The care and love I received from my family, counsellor and Will means that I am now over the worst of my anxiety and depression. I realise now that what happened was not my fault and that I am indeed strong enough to deal with the bad days when they come (which they do from time to time). I am even going to university this year to study counselling and psychotherapy in the hopes to spend my life helping others.,I was extremely lucky to get the support I did and I have , on the Time To Change website to help everyone I encounter who needs it, because everyone deserves the same understanding and compassion that Will showed me. "
,"I’ve always found it a strange concept how physical and mental health are viewed differently. I mean, when I had tonsillitis I received grapes, get well wishes, plenty of hugs and often my friends would throw a few jokes at my expense due to my lack of voice. When I’ve had a relapse with my mental health however things were different which is strange, after all the brain can get sick like any other part of the body?,I’m not referring my core support network when I say this, those who have supported me regardless through anything, and there have been a few of them. My family, my partner and his family, even one or two friends have been a great support network but that’s not the daunting part of living with a mental health condition, how the rest of the word perceives and treats you is the daunting part. For years I’ve complained over attitudes and views towards mental health and cried about a lack of understanding to those suffering with mental health conditions and so how did I deal with it, I pretended I was okay. I lied about why I was off school for months, I lied about why I was absent from work, or from the girls night out and most importantly I lied about why I was in hospital because I was afraid of the response I would get if I admitted I had an illness, or shall I say a mental illness.,Fast forward ten years and here I am, after suffering possibly my worst relapse yet things are looking different. How can I be hurt over other people’s attitudes towards mental health and people treating physical and mental health differently when I do the same thing? Its isn’t a bad thing to not want to talk about your mental health if you’re a private person, but to not want to discuss your mental health because your scared is not fair. I had tonsillitis, went to the doctor, cried to my mum so she would get me a milkshake out of sympathy and never thought anything of it because it was physical. Yet would take my medication in secret, put a happy smile on and pretend I wasn’t experiencing traumatic thoughts or feelings, because people couldn’t see they just didn’t understand.,Well now I am treating both types of illness the same and have come across the mental health champion scheme, I am making it my pledge to discuss my mental health, my experiences and my feelings because it is acceptable to do so if I feel comfortable enough to do it. Whether you blog for the world to see, have a personal secret diary, or just have one person you can confide in it doesn’t matter, as long as you are treating yourself with kindness. It is okay to suffer with depression, anxiety, distress intolerance and the numerous other mental health conditions people of all ages, all across the world suffer with too.,We should build each other up, empower each other and most importantly support each other because mental illness doesn’t care who you are, how old you are, the money you have in your bank or the class system you were born into. Anybody, anytime can fall poorly with mental illness and you know what, that’s okay. With the correct support you will be okay, remember there is always somebody to talk to and somebody out there who knows how you are feeling. That’s the biggest lesson I’ve learnt this year, probably in my whole life and instead of being ashamed, I’m quite proud. I’m 23 and well done to me, I’m much better, starting to lead my normal life again and my mental illness does not define me, just like my tonsillitis didn’t."
"Hannah, ","My mental health hasn’t truly impacted my life for a long time, until now that is. I have suffered with , since being a teenager (well over 10 years), yet my life so far has been full and thrilling. I have been to university, held down jobs, travelled abroad, progressed in my career and got married. Mental illness doesn’t need to take over your life, or be overtly visible to those that know you.,However, recently I have felt the need to resign from my job. After a particularly stressful period at work I started to suffer from acute ,. I mentioned these to my superiors and took a few days off in order to regroup, yet things didn’t improve when I returned. I continued as best I could for the subsequent weeks but finally reached a time when I was unable to function. In fact, when my alarm went off that morning I was simply unable to move.,I took my first ever ‘mental health’ sick day from , and lay perfectly still staring at the ceiling as I didn’t have the energy for anything else. I debated with myself whether I could check myself into a mental health hospital without ‘creating a fuss’ and spent hours tearfully apologising to my husband for being such a burden. This turned into a two month recovery period with regular visits to my GP and a referral to the CMHT.,My family and friends were all as wonderful as usual (I tend to have bouts of , at least once a year, but not severe enough to take time off work), and put up with my neediness and inability to function socially. Above all my husband has been the best spending a fortune on Lush products to entice and motivate me to get a bath, encouraging me to go out walking with him on his days off and inventing games and challenges to aid my recovery that meant I had to leave the house at least once a day. ,I also found a great deal of comfort and help through a local women’s project in York named Kyra (, on Twitter). The staff, volunteers and women who attend are welcoming and friendly, instantly making you feel at home. There is no judgement, just coffee, crafts and chat making it a place I feel safe and accepted. Something you don’t find very often when you experience mental health problems.,Throughout all of this my managers and HR team were incredibly ,. I kept them updated with my progress and was trying desperately to get back to normal, and was pleasantly surprised when out of the blue I received a beautiful bouquet of flowers from my friends and colleagues in a bid to ‘cheer me up’. After a few months when I still felt unable to return to work I thought that resigning from my position would be in the best interest of both my employer and my health.,But it’s not all doom and gloom as I have discovered that employers can be extremely helpful and supportive when coping with a bout of depression, and it has allowed me the time and space I need to recover, as well as considering whether my current career path is the right one for me."
,"There are so many expectations set on us when we become parents, from both external factors and ourselves.,We hear so much about how we should feel and how we should act that before our children are even a twinkle in our eye we have a set definition of how we should be as parents. This preconception about parenting was one of the main things that lead to me developing postnatal , (PND).,I always wanted children, I dreamed of the perfect life my little family would lead, so I was over the moon to find out that I was pregnant with the little girl I had always dreamed about.,My pregnancy went well, better than I expected, but when the moment came to give birth, everything turned for the worst. ,The birthing plan I had so meticulously planned went to pot when my little girl stopped breathing 20 hours into my labour (First preconception – failed). Then those lovely bonding cuddles the midwife drums the importance of straight after birth didn’t happen as my child was being resuscitated (Second preconception – Epic fail!). As for feeding, we had no time to be patient to give my daughter that ‘all important’ first feed from the breast. Her blood sugar levels where dangerously low at birth so she needed feeding fast! (Here came the formula and my third preconception was shot).,In the first 24 hours of becoming a mother I felt like a massive failure. Nothing made this even more apparent when instead of feeling that overbearing love for my child at first sight (the one everyone tells you about) I just felt fear and exhaustion.,Looking back, this is where PND came into my life. It was like she was trailing the halls of the labour ward looking for a weak woman to prowl on and she found me; and since then she has controlled me like a puppet with her ragged dirty fingers twisted in my bones.,Admitting you have PND can be scary as hell, especially due to the , attached to this illness. For me it was near impossible. ,Growing up in Belfast, mental health is something I found to be frowned upon. People recognised for having mental health issues were either known because they committed suicide or because they had hurt another person. We would stay far away from them as if they had the plague and PND seemed to be even further frowned upon, shining light on those who suffered from it as ‘poor mothers’. Every time I heard someone talk about PND it was in shock at how ‘anyone could be unhappy at that time’, or reports of ‘She tried to hurt her kids’.,All in all I would have rather cut my tongue off than admit how I was feeling and face the shame from others. So I suffered in silence for over three years. I controlled my anxiety through routines, becoming obsessed with doing the same thing at the same times everyday. Nothing was enjoyable, being a mum was torture and not enjoying life made my moods and self-hate plummet lower.,Things only changed when I became pregnant again. I couldn’t take it anymore when I hit rock bottom for the second time. All I could think about was escaping, finding a better mum for my children and then disappearing. Perhaps dying. I wasn’t good enough for this world.,But I wanted to be.,The only way to change that was to begin to ,. First to my mum, who confided in me that she herself had suffered from PND. Then to my midwife.,From that moment I have had a team of people looking after me. It’s not been an easy journey, I found it very hard to find the confidence to be a mother, and had to return to Belfast, leaving my husband behind, to receive the family support I so desperately needed to get better.,I’m now 10 months into my recovery, which includes medication and therapy, and I am finally starting to see glimmers of the old me.,I finally feel like I'm awake and can see the real world. I actually enjoy being a mum now and am able to see that I’m not a bad mum, just a very caring and scared one. The anxiety is still there but with the help of therapy, medication, and the support of my loved ones, I’m able to control it better. My biggest fight now is recognising my worth as a mother and to stop comparing myself to the myths of motherhood.,I now work to raise awareness of PND and dispel the stigma of the illness by talking openly about it through my blog ,. I don’t want another person to hide the darkness they are living in. Depression is one of the biggest killers in the UK, and it doesn't have to be.,Talking has been my greatest saviour and it can be yours too.,Just reach out, there are so many of us fighting this, you are never alone. PND isn’t a ‘weakness’ to be shunned, I’ve begun to realise that it makes us strong women and mums. How else could we fight the thing trying to suck the life out of us?"
"Gemma, ","My name is Gemma and I am 34 years old. I suffered with post-natal , after having my first child four years ago and I want to share my experience. This isn’t an easy thing to write about, I guess because it’s a very personal experience. I just feel like it’s important that women who suffer with post-natal depression don’t feel ashamed of it. It shouldn’t be a ,, it’s nothing to feel embarrassed about. It’s an illness. If we talk about it more then hopefully we can be better at supporting each other and helping each other get better.,I was utterly elated when I found out that I was pregnant with my first child. I just couldn’t believe I had a little human in my tummy that was going to come into my life and I would become a mother. I had a pretty good pregnancy and just couldn’t wait to meet my little boy.,My birth experience was horrendous (that’s for another day) but I can still remember the first time I touched my baby. His skin was the smoothest thing I’ve ever felt and he just looked straight into my eyes like he had known me forever. These precious, perfect few moments are what I had to hold onto when I found it hard to ‘feel’ pretty much anything.,Although I didn’t know what it was at the time, post-natal depression hit me almost immediately. It was, maybe, the day after I gave birth that I started feeling bad. This is totally normal after such a life changing experience as giving birth, but it got worse and worse. I just couldn’t face doing anything or seeing anyone. I didn’t get dressed for days on end and was just shut in my house watching TV.,What really hit me hard though, was how I felt about my baby. I didn’t feel in love with him like I wanted to, like I thought I would. It wasn’t even just an absence of affection, it was the presence of indifference that startled me. I enjoyed cuddling him but not really any more than I enjoyed cuddling someone else’s baby. In fact, I distinctly remember thinking that I had felt more love for other people’s babies in my life than I was feeling about my own. I just couldn’t understand it but was powerless to change it.,It’s not easy to admit, even now, that I felt this way about my own child. That I didn’t feel connected to him, that I didn’t adore him. I kept it from everyone apart from my husband and a few close friends. I felt like no one else ever felt like this, like I was totally on my own. How could anyone ever feel so disconnected to their child? It wasn’t normal, I was a terrible person. I felt like my life was just black and I couldn’t see any light, however hard I looked for it. I remember seeing a pregnant woman on a rare walk to the corner shop and wanting to go and warn her about what was going to happen. I felt so sorry for her because I knew how bad it was and she didn’t.,This continued for the first four months of George’s life. Four months of darkness and despair, which sounds dramatic but it’s really true. Then, something changed. I spoke to a friend who is also a counselor and something just clicked inside me. It wasn’t anything in particular that was said but suddenly I just saw a tiny sliver of light. That’s when motherhood really started for me. I started to love my little boy and want to be with him, enjoy being with him. I could see that he loved me and needed me and I needed him. I could face getting dressed and going out again and enjoyed it.,I love George so, so much. If he ever reads this, he will know that I love him and he won’t feel hurt by this, because I was ill. Why am I writing about this? I don’t want other people to deal with it silently like I did. Please, let’s , more so that we don’t feel alone. Post-natal depression should never have to be experienced in silence. "
"Lauren, ","It’s been over four years now since I was first diagnosed with , and ,. It came at a horrendous time because I was smack-bang in the middle of my final year at university, after spending my third year abroad in Spain. I think the scariest part for me was that I didn’t know what was happening. I just knew that I was in a very bad place in my life. So much so, that I had to make the difficult decision to defer my university degree and go back home to try and ‘get better’; whatever that involved.,Only as I was going through the worst time in my life, did I realise that mental illness had been affecting my family for years. I had no idea that my Granny had experienced it all her life, until my Mum went into more detail about it. My Mum had been affected by mental health issues too. Perhaps this is the reason I have had such great support from my parents. They are the two strongest people I know. If I’ve learnt anything it’s that having kind, understanding people around to support you is so important in coping with a mental health problem.,Unsurprisingly, my Mum was (and continues to be) my rock. Her understanding of anxiety meant she provided the emotional support that I needed. The one to take me to the doctors, to calm me down during a panic attack and to offer words of wisdom and encouragement throughout.,In comparison, my dad has always struggled to understand the emotional side of my anxiety; however, he has been there for me in other ways which have been equally as important. Over the months following my decision to leave university, he helped me build myself back up by playing tennis regularly. Some days were difficult, I’d lose my cool or I’d get a migraine. It might sound ridiculous, but every time we played, I felt like I was in a battle with myself. My Dad never gave up on me and remained patient.,It must have been so difficult and painful to witness someone they have both brought up and love unconditionally going through such a vicious cycle of self-loathing, barely capable of getting out of bed, never mind any other part of a daily routine. Something which always sticks with me was my Mum saying ‘your Dad and I didn’t see you laugh or smile for over 6 months.’ No matter how low things got, they never ever lost faith. That unconditional love continued throughout. Although they see me in a much better place now, I still have my down days and they are always there offering encouragement and reminding me of how far I have come.,I am extremely lucky to be surrounded by an amazing bunch of friends, who continue to help me in different ways. At some of my lowest points, including after a break-up, I was fortunate enough to have their support.  A close friend was also going through a break up at the same time as me. It may have felt like the worst idea ever to be around each other at this time, but we were there to lean on each other. We were both giving each other the love that we were finding it hard to give ourselves. We were beating ourselves up whilst being supportive to the other person.,I remember, as things began to get a little easier for us both, we’d go on nights out, look at each other, smile and say, ‘look how far we’ve come mate. We’re both doing so bloody well!’ Now I’m back living in Spain and she’s off traveling the world. If only we’d had a crystal ball to show us where we are now on those nights when we would cry together. Obviously, that would have been far too easy.,Strangely enough one of the most helpful people was a friend who was traveling on the other side of the world. She’d felt the heartbreak of seeing a loved one move far away. I’d be wide awake at 2am, staring into space, my heart beating out of my chest and obviously everyone else in bed. But of course it would be the middle of the day in Australia and there she was, at the other end of the phone, sending me words of encouragement.,In the same way that romance doesn’t always need those grand gestures, us anxious folk are grateful for any small gesture. Sometimes a simple text that says, ‘I’m here if you need to talk’, can be enough. I’m in a new relationship now. It’s not been easy for her to have had to deal with how much the ending to my previous relationship affected me. She has been so patient and understanding. Hearing her utter the words, ‘I’ve been reading up on anxiety to try and get a better understanding’ was like music to my ears. This is the kind of person you want by your side and for this I feel incredibly lucky.,Unfortunately, there is a , associated with mental health. I was one of the lucky ones. Some people still don’t understand mental illness. They are afraid of it, and as a result there are people out there who won’t have received support from their friends and family like  I did. I really do hope that we can combat this stigma. Only by talking more and more about mental health can we achieve this."
,"I have always wanted to share my experience with mental health problems but never really known where to start, so I'm starting here. I have always been an unconfident, anxious and fearful individual for no apparent reason, but never really knowingly understood that I suffer with depression. When I was a teen I suffered with what I now know was depression and had a breakdown when I was nineteen. I suffered and struggled for sometime as to what was happening to me and to try to make some sense of it all. I slowly got better and have had bouts ever since but never too severely. I am 39 now and married to an amazing wife, have a lovely son and acquired a wonderful step daughter. ,Things got bad in December 2014, I remember starting to feel low and going to bed one night and thinking to myself, ""I'm going to have this brain forever and I don't really like it"". That one thought started it all, I slowly went downhill, started not sleeping, being constantly anxious and not eating. I lasted about 2 months with barely any sleep and lost over a stone before I cracked, couldn't hide it anymore. I was laying in bed, been awake the whole night in complete panic and I called to my wife, ""I think I'm suicidal"". I felt so guilty and ashamed to say those words, it was also my son's birthday, some how we managed to get through the day.,I broke down at work the next day, couldn't concentrate,  couldn't rest, I was living in a nightmare, a vicious circle of not being able to sleep but also not being able to wake up. If I'm honest, (and I know that sadly some people will understand this), that if there is a heaven and hell then I have certainly been prepared for the latter because I was in hell. At the end of that week I had had enough, I phoned a crisis number that I had been given from the doctor after an unsuccessful visit, I just couldn't cope. I had reached the lowest of lows and literally just didn't want to live anymore. I felt totally helpless, couldn't understand what was happening to me and wanted someone to just take care of me. There was fortunately for me a centre in the town where I live and they arranged for me to go into see them. I thought that I was going to lose everthing, my family, home, job and couldn't see a way back. I was experiencing suicidal thoughts, paranoia, psychosis and high levels of anxiety - I actually went blind one morning with sheer panic!,Although no one single thing cured me, (and I tried a lot, Reiki, NLP, CBT, meditation, anti anxiety drugs, herbal drugs, changing diet, exercise, I even stopped myself from chasing a vicar down the hight street to see if he could help). I took from them all and found what did help me and learnt to be patient with myself and to like myself again. I know now that I am prone to depression and anxiety and still do have bad days and moments and just like having a physical illness there is an underlying fear of a relapse. However I have learnt a lot about my emotions and how to recognise signs and also what works for me on bad days.,I feel it is important for me and others to tell our stories of mental illness. I want to help change the minds of people that don't realise the seriousness of mental health problems. I have been quite lucky regarding stigma and most people that I have told have been positive. However I play football and the changing room can be a tough place sometimes and I wouldn't feel particularly happy to share my problems there. From my experience I believe sadly that some people are still of the opinion that depression is just people moaning and a weakness and that they should just get on with it. I stopped playing for quite a while due to anxiety and didn't explain to anyone why as I was unsure as to what reaction I would have got. If I had had a physical illness I think it would have been a different story altogether. I've been told that I come across as a big, competetive, competent bloke, (which is most certainly not always how I feel), so I am proof that it can happen to anyone.,I also had to have some time off work last year and although most people were supportive I did feel, and still do to a degree, that people treat you with kid gloves. I understand that this is sometimes a caring reaction but can also be a bit patronising at times. A very good friend of mine once said he didn’t know if to shake me or cuddle me when I was trying to explain to him the way I felt. I can totally understand how he felt as there are no real physical signs, but that’s why it’s important to write, share and educate people that have a lack of understanding and a certain view to help to end the negative stigma of mental health."
"Clive, ","I was diagnosed last February with , and ,. That gradual process of deterioration, the erosion of my personality, of the essential me, had started 6 months earlier. Days when I’d retreat into myself and not communicate with my friends and colleagues. It was just me being moody. Then the panic attacks started. I was becoming a stranger to myself. I didn’t understand myself. I couldn’t communicate my fears to others. I was scared. It was in a moment of clarity when I’d started to look for another job – irrationally fearing the sack – that I decided to see the GP.,The following months were desperate. Initially, I tortured myself with feelings of loneliness, isolation, bewilderment, hurt, shame and pain. Most of that time was a blur. I recall going into work constantly expecting the sack because of (how I perceived) my behaviour. The panic attacks continued but were now mixing with the exotic cocktail that’s agoraphobia. Talking with those people who were closest to me, most important to me, was torture. Obsessed with the idea that I was a disappointment, I’d retreat into a childlike state where I could only give monosyllable answers. I couldn’t look at my wife, friends and colleagues. I’d want to be on my own, which realised the worst fears of my isolation.,It all sounds pretty grim, doesn’t it? Well, yes, it took me to the ultimate extreme of desperation. My life will never be the same. I’ve learnt that I’m a depressive and that I’ve had 4–5 previous attacks that affected my health and career but weren’t diagnosed. The thing is that I’ve survived the crucible of my illness. I am getting stronger. I now have the tools and techniques to help me live.,How did I start to recover? I read a lot about mental health realising that many of my experiences and feelings were echoed by others. My wife was strong, tolerant and gave me time and space. My GP was honest, sympathetic and interested. The CBT helped and the Occupational Health Service at , helped alleviate the pressure that was building in my mind. They did this by supporting my manager, who was terrific. She never gave up, was patient and continually tried to accommodate how I was feeling.,I was asked at work this year to talk about my mental health experiences to senior management and line managers. I’d learnt from talking with many people that the experience of mental health was widespread but wasn’t openly discussed. I wanted to help people by banishing the stigma. I wanted people to know that they weren’t alone. That there was help out there. That they could help other people. That people who were mentally ill could continue to have productive, rewarding careers. I wanted to give something back to my employer who had given me so much help.,A colleague and I did 4 presentations called ‘Negative Thoughts, Positive Results’. We talked for 90 minutes to a total of 100 people without using any presentation aids. We just stood there comparing and contrasting what we had and were still living through. Baring the darkness of your soul is hard. Doing it in front of some people that you know is frightening. We talked about the stark reality of living with our illnesses. The impact on family, friends and colleagues. How we started to climb out of the abyss, back to life. We answered questions at the end on any aspect our experiences and the illness.,The response has been brilliant. People have come forward after suffering in silence. Others have spoken about how they didn’t appreciate the realities of living with mental illness. They are now taking a more considered approach to helping people who are struggling. A mental health group is being setup and will build upon the success of the presentations. One comment on the feedback forms was, “This was the best training course that I’ve attended.”, about mental health is hard but it’s the most effective way to banish the ,. By speaking we can dilute those feelings of shame and disappointment that blight every day. Speaking helps us realise that we are not alone and that we can keep living. Please have the courage and the trust to tell people how you’re feeling. There are more people than you will ever know who are ready and willing to give their support."
"Victoria, ","Approximately 3 years ago, just after I had finished my first year undergraduate law exams, I was diagnosed with clinical , and ,. Since then, I have achieved more than I ever thought I could. But my biggest achievement by far has been learning to be happy in myself.,Before coming to university, I thought that I was unstoppable. Unfortunately, fate put me back in my place by the end of first year. Years of deep sadness and worries had built up until finally my exams pushed me over the edge. I was crying constantly for days on end, I wasn’t sleeping, I lay on my bed endlessly and ignored the knocks at my door. Close school friends visited me, and they knew something was wrong. I refused to go see a doctor; I thought that it would be seen as weakness and that everyone goes through rough spots. The turning point came when I returned to my room one day, burst into tears and fell to the floor. I couldn’t get up. I was paralysed with sadness and anxiety. I booked myself a doctor’s appointment a few days later where I was told that I had severe depression, though by that point I wasn’t surprised at the diagnosis. That period of my life was only the start.,I avoided telling anyone at first, it was my little secret. But gradually I started to understand how my behaviour was affected by my illness and my medication. I could no longer hide it and I began telling those around me when an appropriate time arose. Many didn’t believe me because I had always seemed so positive. Others felt sorry for me. I think, back then, I felt sorry for myself too.,Now I see my mental health in a different light. I no longer make an occasion out of telling people I suffer from depression and anxiety. It isn’t my responsibility to tell them. If mental health comes up in conversation, I speak openly about the topic and give my own personal input if required. I refuse to see it as a taboo, particularly due to its prevalence in everyone’s life. This can unsettle people, but I assure you that this is momentary.,As a final year student, I have been applying to possible , and placements. In answer to an application question ‘what has been your most difficult experience and how have you overcome it?’ I answered truthfully, that it was my depression. I got through to the next stage and in the interview they brought up my answer. They saw that I spoke openly, honestly and maturely about the subject. They were impressed. The fact that they were interested in me, and that they saw the strength in my struggle told me that this was a firm I wanted to work for. Turns out that not only did I get the role, but that the firm is involved in initiatives supporting those with mental health issues and challenging , associated with it. Talking to other candidates during lunch, interview questions came up. I told mine, and a glint of worry appeared in their eyes as if my mental illness were infectious. I ignored the glint and continued with our conversation. Within a few minutes, we were openly discussing mental health and their , of it. I had only just met these people, and yet within moments we had broken down a deeply rooted stigma.,My experience of that assessment day left me confident in myself as a strong person. I no longer feel weighted down by my depression and anxiety when moving forward in my life. Sure, it can make things difficult at times, but I have no doubt that I am a stronger person for it. I won’t let people judge me based on my mental health and I won’t let it stop me from achieving my goals."
,"I am 27 years old and I have suffered from ,and episodes of ,, going back to childhood. I am currently receiving treatment and I'm lucky enough to have a supportive employer and friends and family around me. For a long time, I tried to hide my feelings from all but my closest friends. Recently I made the decision to talk more openly about my mental health and I've had a lot of positive responses. However, there will always be people who do not understand and say insensitive things. I am hoping that by writing this blog post I will help other people to understand a little more about how to talk about mental health in an empathetic way. In my experience, this is one of the most unhelpful things to hear when you are struggling with your mental health:,“There are a lot of people who are worse off than you are. What do you have to be sad about?”,This shows a fundamental misunderstanding of depression. Depression is not about wallowing in self-pity - self-pity assumes you believe that you are worthy of better. Depression tells you that you are worthless and deserve to be punished. It overwhelms you with feelings of guilt and shame. Personally, I feel the pain and sadness of everyone all at once and it is crushing. I have to try to put aside the thoughts of all the suffering in the world in order to be able to function. So I don't need anybody reminding me about all that sadness, or telling me that I am ungrateful for what I've got.,The argument that I'm not allowed to feel bad about my own situation because somebody else has it worse is a flawed one. I thought about this logically and concluded that if there is always somebody worse off than you who deserves sympathy more, among the seven billion humans on Earth, only one truly has it the worst, and we are only allowed to feel sorry for that one person. I don't know how you might go about identifying this person whose life is the most tragic of all. Unless you're prepared to go through the process of finding this individual, perhaps we could agree that trying to one-up somebody's problems is not productive or helpful.,What helps me is having people who are prepared to listen to what I have to say, rather than coming out with empty clichés. Dealing with depressed people can be frustrating because at times we seem to have a negative answer to every solution you pose. However, stick with us, because when we are better we will appreciate your non-judgemental support far more than tactless reprimands from other people. If you know somebody who is depressed, listen to what they have to say, don't try to argue with them if they're upset, and try to avoid saying anything that reinforces their feelings of guilt, shame or failure. Don't shy away because you're not sure what to say, just being there to listen is enough.,Depression makes me want to isolate myself, but this only lets the depression take a greater hold. It makes such a difference to be invited to spend time with friends, even though sometimes I feel anxiety at the thought of socialising. I've been amazed by how much kindness and support people have shown me since I've been more open about my struggle and I really do appreciate it.  "
,"I was diagnosed with , in 2009 and anxiety soon followed. Having lost a 9 year relationship, several professional jobs and a number of friends due to the effects of the condition, I now consider it my most defining feature. After enduring thoughts of suicide, several episodes of self harm and numerous panic attacks, the idea of this life limiting condition being something that I could just shrug off and get over became as ridiculous as asking a terminal cancer patient to look on the bright side. Having lost a close friend to cancer at the age of 33 and another friend to depression related suicide at 34, I have experienced the trauma that physical and mental illness cause and there isn't really much between them. When somebody you love dies as the result of an illness, it hurts in the same way.,After seeing numerous therapists and trying two different types of antidepressants, I am still battling with my condition every day. Alongside the condition itself, I also battle ignorance. People have said things like ""yeah, but you laugh when you watch comedy and you smile you eat nice food, you mustn't be sad all the time."" Those who have depression will probably be silently seething as they read that, those who have no experience of it will be wondering what the problem is. Depression is not sadness. That's something that needs to be firmly established. It's a complicated disease that causes physical and emotional problems that dramatically impact on a person's ability to function. Being able to laugh at a comedy show or smile when you taste a well cooked meal doesn't mean you're suddenly ok, it just means for that moment, you are enjoying the thing that you're experiencing. The brick wall of negativity and lethargy that prevents you from getting out of bed or going to a social event is always there. Sometimes it's just a little bit easier to climb over than others.,My friends and family have been as supportive as they could possibly be and I feel lucky to know so many people who tell me they can be there for me in times of crisis. Unfortunately, unless you have experienced depression and anxiety, it's almost impossible to conceive what it really feels like. This is where the advice and suggestions will come in. Have you tried running? painting? meditating? It might help you feel better if you join a gym! The well meaning suggestions are relentless and quite frankly, exhausting. Although the resources available for mental health treatment are stretched at the moment, I will always favour my GP's advice over that of a misguided but well meaning friend.,At this point, I have learned to recognise some of my symptoms. Among many others, they are: Clumsiness, forgetfulness, self doubt and criticism that goes beyond every day neurosis. I often try to discuss these symptoms with friends in order to help myself organise my thoughts. Although it might not seem like much, it is absolutely devastating when somebody tells me ""that happens to all of us, mate."" It feels as if all of the work I have done to identify the physical and emotional symptoms of my condition was completely futile. It sends me back to the start of this horrible journey when I thought you could get over a mental health problem by just ""getting on with it."" You can't. I am currently on a waiting list for high intensity therapy as well as some medication but in the mean time, I am reliant on my GP and the support of my friends and family.,What I will suggest, is that if you are helping somebody get through depression, anxiety or worse, both, please try to listen to them. That's something that is said a lot when mental health problems are mentioned, but few seem to understand what it really means. Just listening and empathising, without offering suggestions or advice is the most effective form of support I have ever been given. One or two people who have been through the situation themselves have done this for me and it felt incredible. As I waited for the rundown of ""things I can try"" like a sledgehammer made of well intentioned advice, a glorious silence descended on the room and my friend just sat there. He told me he wished he could make it go away but he couldn't. He also told me that any time I wanted to talk about how I was feeling, he would listen. That sounds like almost nothing, but it is more helpful and supportive than any suggestion you could possibly think of. "
,"As many people may have noticed I have been absent from everything for the last 1 ½ years. This has not been a choice. I have been suffering from severe anxiety and depression.  Although only now it was formerly diagnosed, looking back I have realized I have been experiencing it on and off fot my whole life.  Not only has this been the worst time of my life but it has also been equally as hard for friends and family, who have had to witness things I would not wish upon anyone.,Now, after the most serious episode I have experienced, and my 3, hospital admission, I feel, very slowly, I am finally coming through the other side.  I am not saying this for any attention, or for people to feel sorry for me, but to make people aware of how people suffering from this terrible illness would like to be treated and the little things that mean the world to us. ,As this is not a physical illness and people cannot see what is going on, some people find it even harder to relate to and deal with. People are scared to damage or set us back even further – the truth of the matter is, it is worse when things are over thought or kept from us to protect us.,Here is a list of things that have touched me some are big, most are small but they have meant the world:,Flowers and chocolates went without saying – thank you all!!,Although the journey to get to the point of being able to write this has seemed impossible at times, I have also met amazing people on the way. To meet and have the support of people on the same journey, who totally understand has proved invaluable.  Even through the darkest moments we have even managed to have some laughs, in a way you could only have with people who understand 100% what we are going through.  This support network is something I will take with me forever and is the best thing to have come out of this awful experience.,On a final note, thank you to everyone who has been there for me (family, friends, nurses and therapists) – I could not have gotten to this point without you all.   If I do experience another set back I will always remember my nurse singing to me the line to the Aaliyah song “dust yourself off and try again” which has now become my go to motto if I feel low or anxious - it reminds me we can get through it."
"Hayley, ","It was January 2009, I was aged thirty-one and the psychiatrist told me what I had already begun to suspect.,‘You have clinical , and have probably experienced bouts since your teenage years.’,My colleagues would not have believed it. Many members of my family would not have believed it. Still, importantly I believed it. I was relieved that I could now finally access some ,and I had a name for my despondency and tearfulness. I had successfully secured a promotion a few months before and was working hard, I had a loving, kind, sweet (and generally awesome) husband and some very special friends – why was I feeling like this? Why did I have a susceptibility to misery? Why did I hold it together all day and then get into my car and sob every evening? I was beginning to get some answers.,Fast forward seven years (where has that time gone?!) and three children later and I am only just starting to , about my struggles with mental health. I speak to my close friends about things and a few weeks ago I discussed the issues with my mother-in-law for the first time. She was interested and kind and I greatly appreciated her gentle questions. Last month, when it was Time to Talk Day, I encouraged some of the , that I teach to consider mental health awareness and we discussed action that could be taken if people needed help. These are big steps for me.,Another step forward has been starting a blog – 'virtually talking' about mental health issues. I figure the more I blog the more comfortable I will be about sharing my own experiences with other people. I come from a background where mental health is not discussed and treatment is not sought (classic ‘stiff upper lip’ British mentality) but I do not want the teenagers that I connect with every day to go through their teenage years suffering in silence so I have tried to start some conversations lately.,In a few years I will talk frankly and openly to my children about my diagnosis and the techniques and strategies I use to look after myself in order to look after them too. However, most importantly I will thank them for helping me to ‘tame my black dog’ with their innocent fascination in the world and I’m hoping that my gift to them will be to teach them to feel comfortable about , with whomever they wish to, whenever they wish to. "
"Angela, ","Everyone has a ,, everyone has a journey, whether it's just starting or beginning there is a journey that had begun or is yet to begin. Once upon a time my experiences were detrimental. I was constantly attempting to hide what was beneath, beneath all the clothes and smiles and dance moves. I was constantly fighting for something, fighting against something. I was searching for happiness (everlasting happiness). The truth was that what I was expecting was not my reality. Being transparent and taking off this mask was the hardest thing I think I've ever had to do. And if I can be real, I'm not completely there. It's so hard...hard to search the innermost part of my soul to pick up the broken pieces. Why couldn't I just be whole; whole inside and outside? Everywhere I looked was broken. I was broken and my soul was broken.,If I could even count the amount of times I wanted to give up, the times I cried in my room, the amount of times I asked God to just take my life, the amount of times, the amount of times I had suicidal thoughts. Life was just life. Life was just a word. Hearing people's joy made me envy so much in life because to me joy was not natural, it wasn't something I thought about daily. Negative thoughts drowned my mind, insecurity made me feel safe and brokenness challenged me. Brokenness isn't so bad when I think about it. Without it I wouldn't be here sharing it with you...,I have faced numerous challenges as a young carer. We don't get talked about often – but we need help and support too. I had to make a decision whether or not a close family member would be sectioned under the Mental Health Act. It was the hardest decision of my life. I was in my final year of university within weeks of giving in my dissertation and facing my exams. Once I made the decision, I remember breaking down. My family member was taken to hospital and I felt so much guilt in my heart – to the point where I blamed everything that had happened before that stage on me. I carried the burden and it had a major effect on me – I had suicidal thoughts, I was ,.,Being the eldest meant that I had to take care of my siblings even though I was at university. To be honest, my university weren't helpful at all; I had one initial counseling session and that was it. What kept me going were God and my friends. Prayer and faith pushed me to keep going and now I’m using my experiences as a young carer in my project called ,, which enables young people with a , of mental health problems to express themselves through the creative arts. I used dance. Dance was an expressive way of telling people about my journey. There was definitely a lot that I couldn't physically say even though there was a lot in my mind, but in addition to my faith I have dance to set me free and give me a reason to express myself. ,I have faced , and didn't know how to handle it. In fact I held grudges towards these people – I forgave them, which in some cases is the hardest thing to do. I now raise awareness against stigma and discrimination towards mental health problems through my project and as a ,. I am Angela – I am not a statistic – I am a testimony to how you can use your experiences to change your future in a positive way. This is my journey from pain to PURPOSE!  "
"Louise, ","In 1991, after the beginning of my life plan, my husband and I felt we were in the right place in our life to start a family. Met, fell in love, bought a house, married, you know the story.,We were so excited, so were our families. No pregnancy problems, no delivery problems, a perfect baby girl, born in the bath. Breast-feeding no problem; we were so proud of our beautiful child.,After a few months, the Health Visitor asked if I was okay, as I seemed a bit flat. No, I was fine. The second time she asked, we talked and I realised I probably was feeling low, I just hadn’t noticed myself. A visit to the doctor, a prescription and I slowly started to feel better.,The trouble was I hadn’t got any friends my own age with babies or young children at the time. The friends I had were either past that stage or not there yet. I had my Mum, who helped a lot, my husband and his family too. But I had no-one my own age to go through the same things with. This wasn’t healthy or advisable – you need others to ,, to confide in and ,. I didn’t find it easy making friends, which didn’t help.,We moved, we settled into our new home happily and made new friends. There was a really good circle of families around us, at a similar stage in their lives. I made good friends here, and one special friend in particular. My husband and I planned for our second child, again a healthy pregnancy. The doctor and I thought we were prepared for potential post-natal , this time.,I wrote a poem that sums up the next stage in my life whilst attending Speaking Out training with Time to Change recently:, , , ,To say this time in my life was a nightmare would be an understatement. Unless you have traveled to such a dark place you cannot begin to understand the horror. Nobody could have made me feel worse about myself than I already did. The shame, the fear...why me?,There were reasons, I wasn’t a bad or mad person. Thankfully I asked for help before it was too late. That wasn’t easy though. To ask for help when it’s supposed to be the happiest time of your life, is to feel a complete failure. Everyone else around you is happy and coping...aren’t they?,There were some who made life worse:,I understand why different organisations have to be kept in the loop, but how can anyone possibly think that any of this is in any way helpful when you are so ill?! I was shocked to see that professionals could act in such a , way.,Despite the discrimination I experienced, I can’t thank enough those who helped me, carried me through those difficult following weeks. That one special friend, my husband, my doctor and the Community Psychiatric Nurse (CPN) team. After many months of being listened to; being able to talk without being judged; learning to stop listening to those negative voices that grind us down; learning how to think in a more healthy way; how to make a change for the future; I eventually felt better than I ever had. It obviously showed, as family commented on how much happier I seemed. They were right, I hadn’t known I was ill before the final collapse. I can see it now. Hindsight of course is 20/20 vision.,When I hear sad stories that don’t end so well, I remind myself, here but for the grace of God go I! One of my Mother’s sayings."
,"3 years ago, I fell ill.  I was suffering from vomiting sensations, and thinking no more about it I went to my GP and began a course of medication to treat this as a physical issue.  At the time I didn't link it to anything mental; why would I?  It just wasn't anything in my sphere of thinking at the time.  I didn't like my work, and had previously had issues with stress relating to the job, but to me, a physical symptom was caused by a physical problem.  I only became aware that is was something else 6 months later.  ,In September I took a week off work, and the physical symptoms dissipated.  At that point I thought no more about it.  It was only when I was due to return to work and the symptoms returned that I began to think a little more deeply about what was going on.  Why would my vomiting sensation return?  How could this be something physical if the only thing had changed was me being off work for a week?  ,I returned to work on the Monday, by the Tuesday I was sitting in a bus stop 4 miles away from work in floods of tears. I had deliberately gotten on the wrong bus in order to make my journey to work as long as possible.  2 hours later I was sitting in my doctors with a sick note in my hand having completely broken down.  The doctor diagnosed work-related stress which would later develop into depression.,I couldn't believe it.  How had it come to this?  In my home life I was the happiest I had been, I had began dating my best friend (who became my wife a year later).   But there I was, bedridden with crippling anxiety and depression.  I felt so drained.  Essentially I had been struggling with stress at work for 2 years and just 'got on with it'.  My body and then my mind were exhausted.  Looking back now, I can see all the signs were there that I was heading to this, but at the time it just wasn't apparent.  To me, it felt like a sudden and overwhelming breakdown, but in actual fact it was a prolonged exposure to stress that eventually wore me down and wore me out.  ,People say that talking about it is such a brave thing, and for some it is, and I understand and admire that.  I am lucky in the fact that talking about it has never been an issue for me.  I find it very easy to talk about it, and always make myself available if people want to ask me anything about my illness.  ,Best wishes to anyone who reads this and recognised themselves in the situation I had described.  I hope you are at the beginning of this journey rather than at the crying in a bus stop stage. I thank all the counsellors that have dealt with my issue, my union who helped me in the work place, and my loving wife and family who have had to live with this for 3 years now.,It's my biggest regret that I never managed to return to work full time, because I had a dream of becoming a mental health advocate within my workplace.  Workplace stress is a real danger, but it’s still such a taboo.  This year a lot more people will find themselves in my situation, feeling overwhelmed but not recognising the signs until it is too late.  I believe that if I had recognised what was happening to me earlier then I wouldn't still be in the ravages of this condition nearly 3 years later. Let’s not wait any longer to start a conversation about mental health in the workplace. "
,"I am currently on the road to recovery, stepping out of that darkness of postnatal ,. My son is now 2 years, 8 months old. l now love him with the passion you imagine a mother should love their child; imagination can be very different to reality.,My PND was triggered by the trauma of a shoulder dystocia delivery, his head was delivered but his shoulders did not follow. The struggle to remove him resulted in his arm being broken. My priority at this point was my son, and his recovery, I thought very little about my own health.,Life as a new mum is hard. I didn’t know any different, and I thought what I was experiencing in those first months and even years was normal for a new mum. I cried, my son cried, I cried even more. I felt like I had failed in delivering him without harm. I felt like I had failed as a woman. I felt like I was failing as a mother. He lost weight and I blamed myself for not feeding him enough, confusing hunger with cries of pain from his arm. As time went on that self doubt, that parasite that lived inside me spoke up louder and clearer, taking over me.,It told me I had ruined my life, that my son had ruined my life. I felt resentment, I felt anger, frustration that I could do nothing about it. That parasite fed off these thoughts and encouraged them. I screamed at my child, my own flesh and blood. My blood boiled and I had to resist every urge to do him harm. That wasn’t how a mother should be but still that parasite told me not to tell. It didn’t want to be found, didn’t want me to get help.,I was plagued by the words, “you’re a bad mother”, “you can’t cope”, “he really does have it in for you, he’s so easy with everyone else”. I was ,, I was agitated, I was paranoid, but somehow I didn’t think I had anything wrong with me. I’d bonded with my son when he was born and I’d put my all into making sure he was protected – to me that meant that it wasn’t postnatal depression but just that I was not cut out to be a mum.,As time went on and my son recovered, my mental health got worse. Now that I could release some of the worry over him, something broke in me instead. I’d held on and been strong through a traumatic time for his sake, but you can’t be that strong and not come out unharmed.,I didn’t , until he was 20 months old. I had hardly spoken about what was going on, my parasite had kept me quiet, kept me thinking it was just my life, stopped me from revealing what was going on. That day that I saw my GP, spoke to my husband and my brother, my life changed. The power of externalising thoughts, instead of internalising them for them to grow and fester is immense. Talking at this point of course didn’t make me better, but it was a good start and some of the pressure had lifted from my shoulders. I had acknowledged the parasite and it had a name: Postnatal Depression. "
"Sarah, ","I want to talk openly about the realities of living with and trying to support someone who is mentally ill, and what I’ve learned about mental health and , over the years. The stigma of mental illness isn’t just connected with those who are ill, but also to those of us on this journey with them. I live with a partner who has , and , disorder. This means he is often unhappy, critical and negative. To be honest, living with him is far from easy and harmonious.,It’s a roller coaster, that frankly I’d quite like to get off sometimes; but instead, my children and I fasten our seatbelts and remain seated. We’ve done this for many years now, and by no means is our life always awful and miserable, but it’s certainly not the life that I envisioned when I met my husband the best part of twenty years ago (before he was ill). We’re just not the family that I thought we would be, and that’s because my husband’s illness does define our family dynamic and influence how we function and the life that we live. This is not to blame him, it’s not to make him feel worse or guilty and I know he has no control over this; it is simply our reality and that of many, many other families.,The first thing I had to learn, it took me far too long to learn this and I am yet to fully master this one, is that the “enemy” (for want of a better word) is the illness, not my husband. When he is ill, he is precisely that, ill and not rude, obnoxious, nasty, stupid, deliberately hurting those around him, stubborn, nor any of the numerous unpleasant things I feel like calling him when I’m wanting to get off the roller coaster.,It also took me many years of going to social events either on my own, or just me and the children, before I realized that it really isn’t my place to make excuses for his absence. It’s exhausting trying to think of something else to say and trying to remember what I’d used last time, and it’s ineffective, if you’re constantly arriving at things on your own, people are bound to talk, and talk often leads to guesses at what could be really going on and the last thing I need is to be the subject of “gossip”, however well-meaning, amongst my social network.,I’m not saying that I shout about my husband’s condition from the rooftops, or that it’s the first thing I tell new people I meet, but it's no longer something I actively hide, and through this I can assure you I have well and truly found out who my real friends are, who’s going to be there for us and support us. Letting these wonderful people, closest to myself and my children, know that my husband is ill not only slapped the issue squarely on the table, but has allowed us to ask for the , that we need.,I’ve also had to learn that my husband’s illness is not something that I can personally “fix”. I quite simply can’t “love” this particular problem away, this can be really hard as there are times when I simply long for the person he was before, the person I now accept I may never get back.,Perhaps the biggest learning curve was that I cannot protect my children from this, I can only guide them through it. My children are now 11 and 7, but certainly for most of my youngest son’s life this has been an issue. They are bright, intuitive and articulate young men of whom I couldn’t be prouder. Their Dad's illness affects them and it would be naive and potentially harmful of me not to recognize that. So my boys and I ,, about their Dad’s health, they both have age appropriate information, my youngest calls his Dad's health “grumpy poorly again”, whilst my eldest is more familiar with the medical terminology of “depression” and “bipolar”. They don’t like it, why would they? But they know it’s ok to say when they’re worried or scared for their Dad, they know they don’t ever have to make excuses for him, or me, and that they never have to lie about it or hide it.,We don’t have a bad life, we’re not the only people who go through this, we have fun, we laugh, we joke, we’re often a happy and content family, we just also have our challenges and step by step, one foot in front of the other, one day at a time, we’re getting there."
,"A 24-year-old lad, with a good career, loving family, and a great group of friends, depression isn’t something I’ve ever got to worry about…. Is it?,Well unfortunately, yes it is. I was diagnosed with severe depression in December 2015, which turned my whole world upside down. I haven’t told any of my friends: only my family and my psychiatrist know. One of the honest reasons being that if I did tell them, they probably wouldn’t believe me. If you were to observe my friends and me in day-to-day life or whilst out on a night out, I’d be the last person you’d think to get depression. I was always the one having a joke, first on the dance floor, chatting away to people, the boisterous and extrovert one. ,Another main reason for me not wanting to tell people is the fear of being judged, the fear of people talking about it, branding me as ‘mental’ or having ‘lost the plot’. In my close group of friends we have supported each other through many a tough time, but mental health seems to carry such a stigma that it has seen me hiding away from telling them. I had a friend text me the other day asking if I could play 5-aside football. as they were one short. It’s hard to reply ‘Sorry mate, I’ve got depression’ just seems wrong to me, but it shouldn’t be. ,Depression has stripped me of my attributes, and my social life has been ripped away from me, which for any person - let alone a young person - is just horrendous. I’m scared to answer the phone some days, or reply to my friend’s text messages in the fear that they would try and arrange to meet up and I’d have to lie to them or make up some story that I can’t make it. I’ve beaten myself up about it, constantly comparing myself to the way I was before I had depression. ‘You can’t even walk out of the front door, you’re pathetic’.,With most days spent indoors, I’ve often found myself researching the web ,for, what their journey through it was like and then thinking my experience would be the same. The internet can be your best friend and your worst enemy: in a vulnerable state you could easily convince yourself that you will have depression forever, but that’s not the case and I’ve needed my family to keep reassuring me of that.,I’ve now come to terms with the fact that I have depression, which really was hard to accept, and as a man in particular there is a lot of pride to swallow and demons, telling you that you have failed, to stand up to. Today my mum had a friend round for a cup of tea (incidentally, on #Timetotalk day) who is also experiencing depression, and it felt good to just talk with her, knowing that I wasn’t alone.,People must understand that depression manifests itself in many different ways; no two people will go through the same journey. No matter who you are, what you do or where you’re from, depression does not discriminate. Premier league footballers, to the local shopkeeper, the statistics don’t lie that 1 in 4 people will experience a mental health problem in any given year and it can be any of us. It is nothing to be ashamed of or embarrassed about."
,"I had my first child in 2011. I had a straightforward pregnancy and labour and couldn't wait to be a mum. However from the moment my daughter was born I felt different. I was hit with overwhelming ,and a fear something bad would happen to her. I couldn't sleep. I was convinced if I slept my precious baby would stop breathing. Between the two hourly feeds when she would sleep I would stay up watching her breathing. By day three I was so exhausted I was hallucinating – I was convinced it was snowing in the bedroom. Eventually I couldn't last any longer and my body gave way to sleep. Waking to find my daughter was actually fine, slowly I began to feel comfortable with sleeping.,The ,started after a few weeks, my 'baby blues' never disappeared and became worse. I was crying – a lot. I felt angry, I was experiencing intrusive thoughts and felt utterly hopeless. I kept my feelings to myself, always said ""I'm fine"" with a smile on my face. I also lied to my health visitor, I didn't want anyone to find out my secret, that I wasn't coping. The image of a perfectly happy confident mum was a sham. It was all an act. For the first few months of my daughter’s life I felt I was mourning my old carefree days, yet I couldn't imagine my life without her. It was so confusing.,Over the months, my depression worsened. I was isolated, I had no friends or family around as everyone was at work. My confidence was so low I couldn't bring myself to go to baby groups. Eventually my confidence was almost non-existent and anxiety so high I couldn't leave the house without having horrendous panic attacks. Sometimes I wouldn't leave my house at all. I'd avoid all social situations, withdrew from all hobbies, and from my friends. I was a shell of my former self, I would look in the mirror and I wouldn't recognise the person staring back at me. I believed my husband and daughter would be better off if I was no longer around. I thought no one would notice if I simply disappeared. ,It was at this time I discovered I was pregnant again, I'd also realised it was postnatal depression I was experiencing, so I decided to be honest with my midwife about how I felt. I was referred to our local prenatal mental health team and they supported me throughout some of my pregnancy. I started to feel better, however after a couple of months my mood began to deteriorate again and I became suicidal. I should have reached out for help again but I felt ashamed and I was worried the hospital wouldn't let me have the birth I wanted to have – although I now know this is incorrect. With the support of my husband I made it through my pregnancy and I received help after my son was born. I started Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, was prescribed medication and supported by my local prenatal mental health team again. Soon I was feeling much better. ,We decided to try for a third baby, not a decision we took lightly considering the PND I had experienced. We fell pregnant but experienced a miscarriage at six weeks. I felt devastated but we did fall pregnant again soon after. However, the miscarriage had triggered strong anxious feelings around my health and I spent my third pregnancy suffering anxiety and depression again. As soon as my daughter was born I reached out for help. I felt confident that I'd recovered before I could do it again and so I self referred to the prenatal team, spoke to my GP about starting my meds again and began the recovery process. ,Although it's been a long and difficult journey I am now recovered and running peer support for parents experiencing prenatal mental illnesses in Essex. I was so ashamed of experiencing PND to begin with but I now know it wasn't my fault, and there's no shame in experiencing it. It's so important to reach out for help, and you can get better. When I opened up about how I had been feeling, lots of people were surprised and said they had no idea, but everyone was so supportive that I wish I had reached out to my friends sooner. I was also surprised at the amount of people who have since told me that they or someone they know has experienced depression, anxiety and other forms of mental illness. Hopefully the more we speak out will help end misconceptions surrounding mental health. "
,"I knew for a long time that I had a particularly melancholic attitude towards a variety of things., However, I chose to plod on deliberately ignoring the clear signs and symptoms that pointed towards me suffering from depression. I chose for many years to suffer in silence – but I can say now that I feel better having opened up about my depression and actually seeking support. I hope to explain why here – young men can find it very hard to open up about mental illness, I can vouch for that.,I’d say that my depression started to emerge at the age of sixteen. I wasn’t finding many things pleasurable – anything positive that happened I simply shrugged off and didn’t think much of, but anything negative that came my way my mind chose to focus on intensely. I was trapped in vicious cycles of negative thinking, but chose to wear a mask of strength to my peers and friends as I didn’t want anyone to think differently of me. I built up a reputation as a quiet, academic student and made efforts to isolate myself and deal with my depression alone.,Things started to spiral however once I entered university as a fresher. I made a solid group of friends, and initially thought things were looking up. However, my depression started to rear its head again, but this time much more aggressively than in sixth form. It affected my sleep patterns, leaving me exhausted for a whole semester which simply just intensified the misery I felt; it made it hard for me to focus on work but it also made me lethargic. Deadlines would pass and I would simply sit in my room, turn off the lights and disassociate myself from my surroundings. It led me to withdraw from that university and return to my home in Manchester to recuperate – where I then transferred to a university closer to home – the University of Leeds.,I spent the summer working and recovering from my time in London, I blamed myself far too much yet still refused to seek any help. Again, I shut myself off, put on my mask and everyone else assumed it was just the same old me – unaware of how much I was suffering as a result of not only my depression but also my deliberate attempts to hide it.,Once I got to Leeds, I made a great group of friends and I was thinking I beat the melancholic feelings I’d been having ever since A-level. However, I was wrong. They came back again and I tried to combat it, stupidly, through self-medication such as alcohol and other approaches which, at one point, saw me hospitalised.,I forced myself into isolation for days on end – but thankfully my friends were there for me. I eventually opened up about how I felt – and I was absolutely terrified that the first person I opened up to would think of me, or treat me, differently. I couldn’t have been more wrong.,Instead of being shunned, my fears were dispelled and I was pointed in the right direction. The person I first opened up encouraged me to see a GP where I could finally put a name to what I’d been feeling. Although I wasn’t exactly jumping for joy at my diagnosis of depression (that would be quite the oxymoron), I finally knew that I shouldn’t have been blaming myself. Mental illness isn’t something we choose to have, and it’s undoubtedly something we should never blame ourselves for.,Now I’m settling into second year with a marked sense of relief – not only was the huge weight that I was carrying now finally off my shoulders, but its spurred me on to encourage others to do the same. I know from experience that suffering in silence feels like the thing you should be doing –being strong but silent - particularly for young men. But, for me, reaching out made all the difference. I now feel like I have some direction. I know I have to live with my mental health issue, and I know that I may become unwell again, but I will - at the very least - be better equipped to deal with it, and I have support network of friends and an excellent mental health service at university to help me through.,The stigma be damned - I find it liberating that I opened up about my battles with depression, and, rather than facing discrimination, I found support. Therefore, I plea to all of those out there who are currently suffering in silence to open up to someone that they trust. Indeed, many were surprised that I had depression when I first opened up, and didn’t have a clue that I suffered from any kind of mental illness. I had to make the conscious decision to open up about it, but it’s made all the difference.,Comment below or ,, or "
,"Karin is one of the stars of our , campaign,. We sat down with Karin to ask her about her experience of talking ,I was a high achieving single parent, working and lecturing internationally. I thought I was physically ill: I went to the doctor and told him that I couldn’t get out of bed, I just wanted to sleep all the time. I hadn’t considered that I might have depression – I didn’t ever think that would apply to me. But as soon as the GP suggested it, it was like a light came on. I thought: “of course.”,I’d like them to know that mental health is just like physical health – you can become mentally unwell, and you can become physically unwell. It’s normal for people to experience mental illness. It’s all around us: it could be your mother, your sister or your child going through something like that. Or it could be you. As a culture, if we don’t talk about mental health, we’re really negating a large part of ourselves., ,The responses have been varied. A lot of my colleagues at work didn’t think it was a big deal – they just accepted it as part of me, and asked me to tell them if I needed any help, but beyond that they moved on. One of my friends was really surprised that it would be something that affected me: she thought someone who’d achieved as much as me couldn’t have experienced depression. I had to explain to her that there isn’t a single type of person who goes through depression – it can affect anyone., He’s really supportive, he does a lot to help. As a family, our discussion about it is quite open. We talk about mental health a lot: whether it’s about him, his friends or me. It’s been really important for me to treat that as a normal part of supporting someone to grow up and understand the world – it’s no different from talking about sex and drugs. I think it’s important to be open about mental health with your child, because they’re attacked by external images and stereotypes, so it’s important to give them an honest picture of what it’s like. ,It’s very subtle – sometimes he’ll just ask me if I’m alright, or if I need some food. Sometimes he’ll just give me a kiss on the forehead. It’s very straightforward; it’s just a part of our lives. There are no grand gestures or statements – it’s just acceptance. ,Do you want to find out more? , "
,"I’ll start with “how are you?”., How are you today? Are you feeling happy? Sad? Tired? Angry even? Many of us will reply with “I’m fine”. But what does that mean? It’s become such as stoic expression that hides how we ,feel. Being a person with mental health problems, the word “fine” can hide my anxiety, my thoughts and obsessions. It can hide how I’m feeling in reality. Instead “I’m fine” presents idealistically how I want to feel. Not always but it happens.,The small things ,help. It’s not always the big grand gestures that can help, like flowers or chocolates to perk me up. They help but it’s things smaller than that. Something that doesn’t cost money. Something that doesn’t take a lot of time. Something that many of us can do, if not ALL of us. One small thing helps me.,It’s a small thing, but it can mean the world to someone. When I see people smiling, I smile too. It can take my mind off the thoughts racing around in my mind. It’s not easy having health anxiety, social anxiety and OCD. (Rolled into one my diagnosis is anxiety related OCD). It helps me focus on something else for that split second. I look up to them, make eye contact and move my muscles into a smile. I can’t help it.,It’s infectious in the best possible way. It’s contagious. When I see my cousins smiling, my sister smiling…even my dog smiles. It makes me happy.,People say a smile can make someone’s day. It can. I smile at everyone.,I would have said the small thing was asking someone if they are “okay”, but for me, words don’t always work. You may need a hug, a shoulder to cry on or someone to hold your hand. But I don’t need contact either. The simple facial expression of smiling helps me.,I smiled all of the time when I was younger. I was enthusiastic in my childhood and throughout my teenage years even though I was bullied. Then my mental health problems hit, full force, and I didn’t smile as much as I used to anymore.,I then noticed that whilst I was looking down at the floor, people were smiling at me. It lifted my head up for that little bit, before the gloom descended once more. I then learnt to lift my head up more and to smile at people who were looking down at the floor, like so many people had done to me before. It helped me and it helped others, at least I like to think it did because people smiling helped me.,I was giving a smile to get a smile and now I smile all the time.,It helps me whilst helping others.,That’s the small thing that helps me.,Comment below or ,, or "
,"., Go on, say it. It's such a.... depressing word. It conjures up pictures of a person sitting on a dingy sofa, clutching their head and looking anguished. I have depression. I also have a family, dogs and a cat. There are packed lunches to make, teeth to brush, faces to wash, the school run. Then there are the dogs to walk, housework to do, dinner to cook, school run again, entertaining my son, bath time, bed time, an hour or so of doing other stuff then my bed time (sleep is hard to find). How then do I find the time to be depressed? I wear a mask. I smile, chat with the pre-school teachers and other mums and inside, on a bad day, I'm whispering to myself, ""I just want to die"".,I suspect lots of other busy parents wear the same mask, juggling more than me with work and childcare and homework and bills... It can't just be me. But nobody talks about it.,It's an awkward subject to bring up, isn't it? Depression and other mental health illnesses are a bit of a conversation stopper at the school gates. But you know what? I'm really fed up with living behind a mask all the time. ""Yeah, I'm fine, how are you?"" That's a response that means nothing and denies friendship and intimacy. I've started owning up to feeling really rubbish, just with a couple of really close , They have amazed me with their kindness. They haven't made a big deal but have just offered a coffee, an ear, distraction and the chance to feel connected to life if only for a moment. To those friends I want to say: “thank you”. The kindness you show reminds me that depression is not everything that defines me. Depression makes me feel useless, a waste of space, a failure, like I've let everyone down. I get angry over the smallest things and I shout, then I tell myself how awful I am because I shouted at my husband or my little boy. I should just pull my socks up, count my blessings.,Depression isn't catching. I'm not mad. I'm not about to hurt anyone, or anything else the tabloid press would have us believe. I'm ill and I'm doing all I can to get better. If I had a broken leg, people could sign my cast, give me a hand to open doors and carry the shopping. People would sympathise, encourage me to do my physio exercises once the cast was off. People would understand that it would take a while for my leg to build up strength; that I might limp; that it might ache on cold, damp days.,Do I need a cast for my head? If I had one, maybe everyone would understand. There is no big sign, no cast, no flashing light on my head. I don't look ill. Maybe that's what scares some people; if I'm experiencing mental illness then maybe they might do, too, some day. It's just too close to home. Or maybe I'm too unreliable? Some days I'm really chatty, others I might say a quick hello then scuttle off, head down. Please - don't judge, don't stigmatise, don't assume I'm unfriendly or snobbish. It's just the depression. Depression is a real illness and it's not my fault, it's just the depression that tells me so.,Comment below or ,, or "

,"One of the stars of our campaign video, Stephen, spoke to us about the first time he spoke about his mental health, and the small things his wife and daughter do to support him.,I’d been away for a couple of days with work – we had gone away somewhere in Europe. When I got back to the office after that trip, one of my colleagues said something to me that made me question whether I was the right person for the job. I just started turning that thought over in my head and it began to eat away at me. That night, I came home from work, got a cup of coffee and sat on the sofa with my wife and daughters. I knew something wasn’t right: I felt like a cork on a champagne bottle., ,I just said that I wasn’t feeling well, and then I started shaking and crying. I had the feeling that my whole world had come crashing down. Part of me felt I was being a being a bit of a softie, because I hadn’t really cried or shown my emotions up to that point. I was always the protector – the big fella to turn to if anything went wrong. But I didn’t feel like the same person: I just didn’t feel strong any more., ,They weren’t used to seeing me like that. My wife brought me a cup of coffee, and my daughters were giving me hugs and telling me that no matter what, I was still their dad. My youngest daughter said she would still be proud of me no matter what happens to me. My wife phoned the out of hours doctor and I made a appointment to see the GP., ,My daughter Ellie has been with me from the start – she’s seen me both as a big strong dad who wouldn’t admit he had a problem and as someone who’s unwell and a bit vulnerable. We go fishing together a lot. There’s a little pond nearby that we go to: you can hear the birds and the wind in the trees. Ellie’s great at fishing: she can pick fish out of the middle of the Gobi desert, that one.,She’s stuck by me through thick and thin, though, and it really helps me for us to have time together. I like to spend time with her now to pay her back for having belief in me, and sticking by me when other people wouldn’t. She’s my biggest supporter.  , ,I want people to know they don’t have to bottle up their problems. Men often don’t admit there’s anything wrong – we just have a couple of cans of beer and try to get on with it. But it doesn’t have to be that way. That’s why I’m really open about my experience – I would shout loud and proud from the rooftop that I have a mental health problem.

,"“It feels like I am at the bottom of a well. I can see the light at the top but there’s no way to climb out”,I remember describing that feeling to my counsellor when I was at my worst. I was diagnosed with ,in 2014, but in all honesty I had the same empty feeling for about five years prior to that. Every day, over the years I’d wake up and pray it would go away and that I could keep it a secret. But it never did, it just got worse. I will never forget Thursday 14, August 2014, that was the day I hit rock bottom and felt suicidal. I was at the bottom of that well.,How did I get out of the well then? I’d lost who I was, who I used to be. In my place was a human being I didn’t recognise in the mirror, someone who just existed rather than living life. I did most of the climbing myself, but my friends held out their hands along the way to help me up. When you go through something as serious as mental illness, you realise who is there for you no matter what. I lost people who didn’t want to know me. But my family and friends have been amazing and I am so grateful and lucky to have them in my life.,In my experience, the best thing to do is reach out to others. There will be people who want to help you so please don’t be afraid to seek help. It doesn’t make you weak -  it is the strongest thing you can do. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t sugar coat anything: it’s still hard. There were still things in my head that couldn’t be fixed by other people. I had to fix it myself.,One day I got up and I have no idea why but decided to fight back, I’d had enough. It was the hardest thing I’ve ever done but also the best. It was scary, it was horrible; there were days I would fall to the floor and just cry and cry. But somehow, some way, I dragged myself out of it. With support from other people I became myself again and re-discovered what I love, for me it’s my football and my music, I’ve lost count the amount of times the lyrics of my favourite band Papa Roach have saved me.,My advice to anyone going through something similar would be to accept that your mental health may be a part of you but it doesn’t and should never define who you are and seek support from those around you who love you and want to help. And I promise you one day, you will wake up and the world will look just that little bit brighter and when it does it’s a pretty neat world to live in.,Comment below or , and find out ,. "
,"You wouldn’t believe how many times I’ve tried to write this. Somehow the words just don’t come out. To give you some idea, there was a six month gap between me writing this and me clicking “send”.,“I’ve got ,.” Why is it so hard to say those words? Three words. I’ve felt less nervous saying “I love you” and those are supposedly the three most difficult words to say for the first time. “I love you” is a walk in the park compared with “I’ve got depression”.,I was first diagnosed with depression in December 2009, and I was at my lowest point when I was diagnosed. I knew I had depression. I was most recently diagnosed with depression in October 2014. I argued so much with my GP. “But this doesn’t feel like last time,” I recall saying. “It doesn’t feel as bad. Maybe it’s not depression.” I think it was diagnosed before I’d sunk any deeper. I started to feel better after a short while. I was back at work (I work in informal science education) and I was so sure my GP was wrong and it wasn’t depression. Turns out I was wrong. She was right.,In an interview in 2013, Stephen Fry said that when he is presenting QI, “there are times when I’m going ‘ha ha, yeah yeah’” but inside was saying to himself “I want to die. I… want… to… ,.” I remember thinking how I couldn’t understand that. My experience of depression, the first time, was that I could barely get out of bed, let alone leave the house. I know that everyone’s experiences of mental health issues is different. I didn’t realise that each of my experiences with depression would be so different. I present shows for children. For a while after I was diagnosed, I didn’t present shows. Then I felt better, so I started presenting again. Then I stopped. Now I’ve started again. I don’t feel like I’m ready to, but I just want to cling on to normality and “me” by my fingertips. Now I totally get what Stephen Fry was talking about. Not to the same level, but now I understand. Now I know all about putting a brave face on how I feel. How I’m smiling and laughing and joking on the outside but I’m crying inside, hating myself and wishing I could be anywhere but there. Sometimes it does get too much though. Sometimes you have to share how you’re feeling with others because it becomes too much to keep inside.,I’ve got a very small but incredibly perfectly formed support network. I can count the number of people on one hand. They’re the ones who know me too well to believe me when I say I’m fine. They’re the people I share my feelings with when I’m at my worst as well as my best. They don’t have any issues with me having a mental health problem – they’re just proud of me for dealing with it and taking ownership of it. The problem is I spend significant amounts of time worrying a gust of wind, or even a slight breeze, will make it come tumbling down. However low I’m feeling, I can make myself feel worse. How do you share this with people? Even people who care about you don’t want to constantly hear how you’re worried that one day they won’t be there.,The question “how are you feeling?” is such an odd one. Because however much someone genuinely cares, you can’t actually tell them you spent the whole day crying inside (but laughing on the outside, of course) because you’re worried that one day they’ll get bored of you being “the one with depression”. But you hope they ,One day, I’ll be able to open up to more people about my depression and not be scared of what they think. If they have a problem with it, all it’ll show is their own lack of knowledge about it. I know I can do it – and when I do, I’ll have my small but perfectly form support network to thank.,Comment below or , and find out ,. "
,"I used to feel like I was branded - like people could see my mental illness stamped on my face clear as day. So I used to hide - hide behind the jokes, behind the excuses and in the dark of long nights.,Things were hard, and they kinda still are, but nowhere as bad as they used to be and that's down to one thing. I started to talk. You see, perspective changes everything. You talk to someone and ask them to look closer and soon they realise that it's not actually a brand on your face but rather a scar, you've seen battle. These battles come in many forms.,No battle is too small and every fight is worth talking about. Sharing your story is adding another brother or sister in arms. You might think you can do it alone and maybe that's possible, who's to say? But the real question is why should you when you could make it so much easier by sharing it with someone else?,So how about I put my money where my mouth is and share with you the story of one of my biggest battles, one many can relate to – my experience of school.,As 1 of 5 black kids in the entire school, I was from Sudan with an American accent, squeaky voice and wearing hand-me-down clothes from a middle aged support worker. I got picked on a lot. Even some teachers couldn't find it in their hearts to accept me. School seemed like a giant scary monster that only ever grew more fangs.,I felt so alone all the time. A lot of the time I’d walk around by myself at night, those walks home around Christmas time were worst. I would walk past row after row of happy family home and force myself not to stare or look in. I would imagine what it would be like to live in one of those houses, to come home to a nice living room, maybe a dog. Above all, I would feel safe.,Broken. Now that's a word that many of us who struggle with mental illness can relate to. This feeling first came to me from my lack of understanding of what was wrong with me. Why did I feel so sad all the time? Why couldn't I enjoy life like all the other kids? Why did the world feel so irrationally terrifying?,I'm not saying that being diagnosed with anxiety and depression made it all go away. It didn't, but what it did do is make me realise that this was something beyond my control. More importantly, it showed me that it's something that I might be able to recover from. That diagnosis allowed me to breathe the sigh of relief that comes with taking the first step on a journey. A journey that I couldn't wait to see through, because I knew at the end of that road, I can pick up a mirror to see myself smiling again.,When you’re feeling like I did back then, you might feel like you’re broken, like you can't put yourself back together, but another person can sit down on the floor next to you and help you pick up the pieces. They aren't there to judge but to try and make you feel whole again. You let someone in and they let you in and slowly the world becomes a better place.,Finding someone to talk to is not an easy task because you are trusting them with your inner most thoughts. Don't rush into it, you take your time and build up the courage to do something brave, open up and when you're ready you tell them of those battles. You tell them of the things that haunt you every day and night. At first, this won't come easy, but you take it in stride, soon the letters will become words, the words sentences and the sentences stories.,Just think about it for a second - how would you feel if you could tell someone all those things make your heart so heavy? Can you feel how even the fantasy begins to loosen your chest? If you feel like you might want to take that next step, then it’s time to talk: it really could change your life.,We talk and we listen. In the darkness, one by one like fireflies we'll glow bright until we end the stigma."
,"Despite such a large number of people experiencing mental health problems there remains an undeniable stigma surrounding mental health, a stigma which I believe stems from a lack of understanding about the experiences of people with mental illness. It seems to be exactly this stigma which has prevented me (and undoubtedly many others) from sharing personal experiences with mental health problems; for fear of an intimate disclosure being met with judgment.,However, in a vicious cycle, it seems as though our reluctance to talk about our own mental health issues might help to fuel this stigma. By not sharing my own experience, I sometimes feel that I may inadvertently be insinuating that having mental health problems is something embarrassing, something to be ashamed of, when it isn't at all.,By sharing our personal encounters with mental health problems, we can encourage more people to get talking about mental health, and the more people talk, the more people will understand mental health and the less mental health will be stigmatised.,I'll begin by sharing my story...,I've struggled with my mental health since age 13 when I developed anorexia. I don't know what brought it about but I know that I was consumed by this obsessive illness for about 2 years. For me, anorexia was a horrible paradox; despite feeling like I was entirely in control of what I ate, in reality the illness was entirely in control of me.,In my second year of university I developed depression and anxiety, sparked by some problems at home, which resulted in me deferring university for a year. I felt like I was in a dark hole that I would never be able to get out of. I started to lose weight and also lost interest in doing everything that I previously enjoyed. I constantly got panic attacks. I spent the vast majority of my days in bed.,Fortunately, I've overcome all my issues with food but I think that depression and anxiety will always come and go throughout my whole life. Although I've been on prescribed medications before, what I found helped the most was being able to talk about my mental health issues. I'm conscious of not generalising mental health and am aware that not everything will work for everyone. However, I do want to stress the vital role communication has always played for me and many others.,I've been so lucky that I've always had that support from my sisters and friends, but I've also experienced people who haven't been so supportive. I don't think it’s because they were bad people, I simply think their lack of an adequate understanding led to their stigmatisation of mental health problems.,I wanted to share my experiences of mental health in the hope that it might encourage other people to share their experiences with mental health; and the more we talk, the more people understand and the less mental health is stigmatised.,So if you have experienced mental health issues (either directly or indirectly) don't be afraid to talk about them! There are very few people who I’ve talked to about my mental health, until now - I know it's scary, but having mental health issues is nothing to be embarrassed or ashamed of. It's time to change and it's time to talk!,Comment below or , and find out ,. , "
,"My name is Ellie, I'm 22, a full-time student entering my 3rd year of English Literature and owner of a business. I also have depression and anxiety.,In my head depression is a bubble. I am trapped inside while the world continues around me; everything is muted and emotions are near impossible to experience. I am alone. The panic attacks are a black cloud; they follow me and with no warning are on top of me. I cannot get away from it no matter how hard I try, breathing is almost impossible and my mind is scattered in the wind. I can't decide which is worse, the overload or the exclusion.,University has been a  tough journey for me.  Initially I had to leave after 7 months due to panic attacks, depression and feeling like I couldn't cope with the world. I have been on medication, seen counsellors, and slowly, I've become stronger in myself. Recently I have been having increased anxiety attacks; from being unable to get out of the taxi at my university's summer ball, to breaking down at the thought of going somewhere new. When I cannot control a situation it triggers me. My boyfriend is amazing with this and has dealt with his fair share of my episodes, without his help I would not have achieved what I have today.,I set up my business in my gap year, before hitting my roughest patch, and almost 4 years on it has become almost as important in keeping my feet on the ground as my family and friends. It gives me a reason to get out of bed and it is a constant in a world where I feel lost without control. I don't want people to feel that they cannot achieve, that their illness is a barrier to doing what they love in life. My passion is my job; yes, I have days where 'the bubble' takes over, the world is muted and grey, but I am learning to cope.,Don't be held back, don't be scared, be proud of who you are because you are not alone. The more we go out into the world and show them that we are stronger than they could imagine, the less of a stigma we will face. The most important thing I have learnt is to go at my own pace, to not be afraid to take a day out to hide away from the world. It doesn't make you a failure to look after yourself. I don't believe my illness defines me, it isn't the most important thing about me, but I want it to be as accepted as everything else about me is. ,Comment below or , and find out ,. "
,"People have asked me before, what is it like to live with a mental illness? I’ve been thinking about this question a lot recently.,Until a few months ago, I would have given the answer that I thought they wanted to hear, or I would have shrugged my shoulders and not really known what to say. I didn’t really know what it was like to live with a mental illness, because my mental illness was my life; it was all I really knew, and I couldn’t imagine life without it.,I had first been diagnosed with an eating disorder when I was sixteen, but the thoughts and behaviours that completely controlled me over the next four years - in the form of depression, anxiety and self-harm - had always been there. I didn’t know what it was like to live without feelings of self-hatred and a voice in my head that constantly told me why I was inadequate, disgusting, worthless and simply wrong in every way.,I didn’t know it was possible to live without constantly panicking about what I was eating and how much I weighed, or without having panic attacks and extended periods of time where I wanted nothing more than to fall asleep and never wake up. To ask me what it was like to live with a mental illness was to separate the illness from myself, from my life, as if it was some kind of additional thing. This wasn’t the case. The illness was my life; it seemed that to live without it was to stop living.,If you ask me now, my answer would be different. For me, living with a mental illness that controlled every thought and behaviour was not really living at all. On a good day, I was coping with a mental illness. On a bad day I was unable to cope. At no point was I fully living my life.,Having been controlled by illness for so long, the idea of living a life without it controlling you, is terrifying. It is unknown, unfamiliar and feels impossible. I remember counsellors and psychiatrists talking about recovery, and I remember being terrified of the prospect. I hated being ill, but I didn’t know who I was if I wasn’t ill. I didn’t believe it was possible not to be ill. Even as I went through the recovery process, I was waiting for the illness to come back, almost welcoming it back at times, because I didn’t know how to be without it.,But through this period of recovery, I have been extremely blessed with wonderfully patient counsellors who have helped me see that I deserve, and can have, a life that isn’t controlled by mental illness. I have learnt to express emotion and talk rather than burying everything and taking my anger and sadness out on myself. I am a Christian, and have learnt to lean on Jesus as my rock rather than running away from love and finding my security in the numbness that illness offered me. I have learnt that it is okay not to be okay. It is okay to have good days and bad days and make mistakes and not be perfect.  I have learnt that Abby can have a life.,Recovery is an ongoing process, and it is a hard one. But it is worth it. I am twenty years old, and I feel alive for the first time. There are things I can do now that I couldn’t have even imagined doing a few months ago. These things aren’t easy, but they are possible, and they are becoming less and less scary.,I can laugh and cry and express myself rather than being too scared to do so. I can eat a piece of cake with a friend without feeling guilty for days afterwards. I can make a mistake without needing to self-harm to numb the shame and fear that I felt. I can let people in, and be myself around them without constantly fearing that they are about to run away. I don’t have to suppress every emotion through fear that I might completely fall apart if I let anything out. I can talk about the things I am struggling with without feeling too much guilt, because I have learnt that I have a voice and that I am allowed to use it.,Recovery is painful and scary and full of bumps, but it is worth it. If you are struggling with a mental illness, you aren’t alone, and it doesn’t have to be like this forever. You deserve support. You deserve happiness. You deserve a life.,Comment below or , and find out ,. "
", ","I suffer from ,.  I have done since childhood but due to the,associated with it, together with my own stubborn 'there is nothing wrong with me' attitude, I couldn't or wouldn't admit it.  But then, something happened.,After holding on to a dark, scary secret for over 30 years, a chain of events made me feel as though the world was closing in on me.  I was convinced that this secret, which wasn't mine to keep, would come out and ultimately, destroy my family and life as we knew it.  As my fear escalated and everything was spiralling out of control, in desperation and against my grain, I finally, finally confided in someone.  I reached out and shared my secret; the secret.,In doing so, I felt so many things. Firstly, guilt. Why the hell have I told someone about this heinous abuse of trust and violation of me; this wasn't a salacious story for public consumption, it was my life - it was part of me.  It was something that made me the woman I am.  Next came relief.  The only way to describe it was like an urgent need to go to the toilet and that sensation of sweet release when you finally get to one.,Then came the shame.  I had to face my confidante every day.  She knew what had happened to me.  She knew everything.  She saw me at my most vulnerable; I felt naked - exposed.  I couldn't look her in the eye and 18 months on, I still can't.  Shame.,Regret - I shouldn't have told anyone; I should have continued to keep on keeping on.  Safeguarding this horrific secret that wasn't mine.  My rational mind knew that what happened wasn't my fault.  But my depressed mind didn't.  So my depressed mind regretted exposing 'my' issue; 'my' failing - my dirty little secret.,My confidante saved my life.  Because once I told her, sharing my experience, my feelings, my pain, my misery - my devastation became easier each time I did it.  Therapy saved my life.  My friends - not fair weather ones but genuine bonafide friends saved my life.,When you start a conversation about your mental health and the triggers behind it, things get better.  Not because some therapist waved a magic voodoo stick in your face.  Not because therapy cures it all.  But because you've freed yourself from purgatory.  Keeping you pain, your hurt, your guilt, your shame; your devastation to yourself consumes you.  It eats away at you; changes you, shapes you, moulds you.  Makes you believe untruths about yourself.  Suppresses you and dulls your shine.  Strips you of YOU.  And all you're left with is your pain, hurt, guilt & shame.  It holds you back.  It stops you from developing healthy relationships.  It makes you believe you are worthless and have no value.,You start a conversation and you're creating a portal to accept healthy, positive, real thoughts about yourself.  You allow yourself to look back at you in retrospect, acknowledge what you did wrong, accept the things you had no control over and look at how you'll go about fixing you.  Until you start that conversation, purgatory is your domicile.,I still feel guilt & shame.  I still struggle each day to leave my house and go to work.  I still have to wear a façade each day, laughing and joking with people to make them think I'm ok.  But because I started that conversation, dammit, I am getting better.  And one day, I will be better.,My confidante, my therapist and the friends I've shared my story with are amazing and I wouldn't be where I am today without them.  They have contributed to my recovery in their own way and for that, I am eternally grateful. 18 months ago, I was on the brink.  I was contemplating taking my own life; no joke, true story - I'd already self harmed for many years.  18 months later, I'm not all cured, I don't burp glitter and rainbows.  I do, however, have hope.  I'm on the path to self improvement.  I am getting better and you can too.  Please confide in someone.  Please tell someone how you're feeling.  Because once you do, you've released yourself from purgatory.,Remember, you are loved.  Someone loves you.  But also remember, you need to love you.  Love yourself enough to reach out and start a conversation.  Love yourself enough to know your mental health isn't your fault.  You deserve to be happy & free.  But you can only achieve that by taking that first step.  It's good to talk.,Comment below or , and find out ,."
,"Many people cringe at the phrases, ‘emotionally unstable personality disorder’ and, ‘,’. They don’t sound particularly inviting. People hide away from it or stigmatise it because they don’t understand what it is like to experience it. My name is Leanne and I have borderline personality disorder and to say my journey has been a rollercoaster is an understatement.,I have had four long years of highs and lows, self-hatred, low self-esteem, ,, ,, hallucinations and episodes that I barely remember. I have also felt emptiness for months at a time and never been able to fully trust all except a couple of people: but I have gotten through it.,It all started with panic attacks from a young age. My peers called me an ‘attention seeker’, and the staff were never able to help much, not even fully understanding what I was going through. Whether they judged me or not, I’m not sure. To be honest, I don’t think I ever fully understood myself until last year when a doctor suggested I had emerging personality disorder traits. At times I felt like a freak, because that was what people made me out to be; I understand better now.,The stigma only got worse when I reached college and people used more degrading language when referring to me. Soon enough I was low and attempted suicide. When my family came to visit me in hospital, I tried to make jokes, but inside I was ready to burst in to tears, feeling so much shame for what I did. Only now did I realise it was a way of me trying to cope. It isn’t the positive way and it didn’t help, when I reached home I realised that I needed to fight to be with my family.,I would be lying to you if I say I haven’t thought about it, or done anything to harm myself. But I have an amazing support network, especially one person who also experiences mental illness. I owe that friend my life: she has been amazing and a constant in my life, never giving up on me. I will never forget the moment our bond was ultimately sealed after admitting our issues to one another. I can never repay her for all she has done because she could just as easily walk away from me. Of course, there is my family who have been here through it all with me, each in their own way, helping in any way they can. Things with the mental health team have been a little rocky in transitioning me but now I am on the road to recovery, with a positive end goal.,For those of you reading this, especially if you do have a mental illness, remember to always have hope and keep fighting on. If I, of all people, can be strong enough to overcome the daily struggles, then you can too, I believe in you to be strong and to stay on the positive path.,My name is Leanne and I have borderline personality disorder. Four years ago I couldn’t see my future: it was a foreign concept to me, I hated myself and was so full of anxiety.

,"It’s a lonely old thing this depression malarkey.,Having suffered various degrees of , over the years I find myself at the age of 51 doggedly fighting what is the most profound and desperate black time I have encountered. I continue to function - at work, at home, and socially – but I am dogged by suicidal thoughts on a daily basis and have had some difficult nights where these thoughts have laid siege.,It’s become clear to me that, at least in my case, there is a gulf of difference between thoughts of suicide and actually taking my own life. I have thought about suicide in great depth and about how I could say goodbye to my daughters in a way that minimises the legacy of a father who has taken his own life (as if!). I've written reams and reams to try to give those I would leave behind an insight into my innermost thoughts. The bottom line really is that I will never do it anyway. But there's the rub. Just because you know that you won't do it doesn't make the pain any less. And feeling this way continually over a long period is incredibly debilitating.,So what do I do?,I manage these horrific feelings in several ways. I keep them in perspective which is difficult but I find doable - I know that the feelings ebb and flow and if I am patient things will change. That's how it works for me anyway. I do self-analyse an awful lot.  To help me cope I also tend to drink, which sometimes is quite effective in anaesthetising an immediate feeling but has a very negative cumulative effect on my outlook, so I constantly attempt to control it.  I try to exercise, and getting off my backside when all I want to do is crawl into a hole is very effective in changing mood – if and when I can actually achieve it. I have also sought help via the doctor and been prescribed anti-depressants. It’s difficult to know actually how effective they are.,Perhaps the best thing I have done, and this is definitely in response to the Time to Change campaign, is to communicate my feelings to (some of) my support network, which I am very lucky to have. The fear of judgement is quite difficult to manage, and choosing an audience is essential I think, but it really does help to share. I have experience in the past of people and organisations reacting negatively to mental health issues (depression and anxiety) but there seems to be a change in mood these days, which is useful. The reactions of people are incredibly varied. Some people just don't get it. Some people run away. Some people get very upset. Some people (very close and trusted friends) don't talk to me anymore. Other people are fabulous, non-judgemental, supportive and just lovely.,I will battle through this horror. I will be confident, charming, funny and gregarious again - very soon. It’s my life, I'm dealing with it. I won't lose it to the thoughts I sometimes have because I am in charge of my thoughts, they are not in charge of me.

Well, it’s my way of getting people to talk about mental health, which I hope will make a tiny difference to combat the stigma around the subject and for them to be a little more enlightened and perhaps more comfortable to talk to loved ones, colleagues or friends about mental health. Talking to people makes me feel empowered and is one of ways I am trying to thank those of who helped and supported me. I am gaining confidence and no longer feel ashamed about my mental health. So last Friday’s conversation went something like this…,Magician man asks “Have you ever been to Winchester before?”,I reply “Actually I lived here for three months last year”,“Only three months” he replies “that was a short stay”,“Well, too be honest I was in a specialist psychiatric unit just up the road, so that’s why I was here”,Magician man says “Wow I’m sorry to hear that.  Are you better now?”,And so we chat for about 5 minutes.  He tells me about a family member who had been unwell and I tell him about my experiences and how I am recovering.  Job done for today!,Comment below or , and find out ,."

,"My best friend and I had a running joke that we would moan about things - it started off little things but gradually I noticed the moans got more frequent and less jokey., At one point I read over our messages and noticed that she only said negative things. I was concerned and brought it up with her; she was not aware she was being so negative and insisted she was fine.,A few months later I got a distressed phone call saying she could not get out of bed. She was not able to express herself clearly and I did not know what to do from a distance. A couple of days later she managed to get to the doctors and she was diagnosed with ,Since being diagnosed, she has become progressively worse. She has become suicidal, been sectioned, has regular , periods and has lost everything positive in her life. Although she has sought help, she has been consistently let down by the services she has encountered and her condition continues to deteriorate.,As her best friend, I have been supporting her throughout everything. It has been one of the hardest things I have ever done and had no idea how stressful it would be, yet I know I will never stop loving her and supporting her.,Her depression has thrown major obstacles at our friendship, including her pushing me away, revealing a double life, losing all aspects of a normal friendship, relentless hopelessness, resentment and anger directed at me, as well as all the stress related to her attempts to take her own.,I have often felt lost and had no idea what I should do, or why I am putting up with it. I have wanted to walk away many times when the situation has become unbearable or I can’t face the guilt of not being able to make her better. I have felt reluctant to voice the pressure I have been under and I have also felt guilty over some of the thoughts I have had. I know her emotions and behaviours are due to her illness but it does not stop the hurt. Normally when faced with negative and sometimes aggressive situations, you would leave and distance yourself from that person, however with depression it’s the opposite and I have had to learn how to handle this and still be able to stick around and support her.,Although it is challenging, I refuse to give up on my friend. I do not for one second regret my decision to support her through her struggles and I hope one day she will beat her depression.,Comment below or , and find out ,."
,"My whirlwind experience of mental health issues started after my mother passed away in 2010. My world was torn apart, and I just didn't know who to turn to. I was only 15, my GCSEs were looming and my hormones were all over the place. My dad was abusive at the time and my brother is autistic so I didn't feel like I could talk to either of them. I was completely introverted for about 18 months, not getting out of bed, not seeing a point in anything and most of all, just wanting to not be here anymore; until I met someone who now I consider to be my lifesaver. My ,saw what was happening and encouraged me to go to the doctors. They couldn't believe that I had kept it to myself for that long and they were so so pleased that I had come to see them.

,"This year, I was sat in a classroom learning about relapse prevention as part of my training to be a mental health nurse. When I was 18, five years ago, this isn’t where I thought I would be in 2015. Before I became unwell, I’d never thought much about mental illness. Five years later, I’m embarking on a career dedicated to supporting people who experience it.,I had what you could describe as a ‘perfect’ childhood. I had the support of a great family, got on well with others and had a great set of friends. I excelled at school both academically and at sport. I left 6, form and headed off to study a science subject at a top university. I did what all 18 year olds do and flourished in my newfound freedom: I met some brilliant people, threw myself into my studies and played football for the university’s 1, team.,Things began to change halfway through my first year. I struggled with the fact that I was no longer top of the class: I was studying alongside hundreds of other extremely bright individuals and I was ‘mid-table’, if not below average. I was self-critical and punished myself for not performing. I became depressed and withdrew from everything and everyone that I enjoyed.,I don’t remember the first time I heard voices, but remember when I realised I had to reach out for help. I was sat in my room doing some work late at night and heard what I thought were two people having a blazing row in the room next door. I couldn’t tell what was being said but knew from the tone it was an aggressive confrontation. I rushed out of my room and banged on my neighbour’s door, who answered dazed and confused as I’d obviously just woke her up. Retreating to my room I began to reflect on other experiences, how I had heard people arguing before in rooms or behind doors. I didn’t know what to think, I could no longer trust my own sense of hearing. I was scared and isolated myself further.,After a number of weeks of continued, worsening experiences I decided to speak to my GP. At this point I had started to pick out words from the mumblings such as ‘disappointment’ and ‘failure’. My GP was great, really understanding and acted straight away in referring me to early intervention services and university support services. I struggled on for six months, but eventually managing my degree as well as my mental illness away from home became too much and I moved back in with my parents.,What followed was two years of appointments with psychiatrists, sessions with nurses and a lot of medication. I expected to be better straight away and be in a job in a couple of months, and I became frustrated when things didn’t happen this way. However, with the support of professionals and my family, I got there. I’ve been off medication for over a year and haven’t heard any voices in over two years.,When I was recovering, I read a lot about different mental illnesses and different treatments and found it fascinating. As a result of my own experience, and because of my interest in mental health, I decided to train to be a mental health nurse.,I think my experience helps me to do my job well. I suppose that most people can empathise with somebody who is physically unwell, as we have all experienced physical illness. However, being mentally unwell is entirely different and I think having lived experience makes it easier for me to understand how they are feeling, what they are doing and why they are doing it.,Choosing to train as a nurse was the best choice I’ve ever made. I was most encouraged by my psychiatrist who said that I had ‘so much to give so many’ and during my last meeting with her said that she hoped the next time she saw me would be in a professional capacity.,Stigma is something that still affects me. Working in mental health, you would expect that I would be able to be open about my illness, but I'm not. It's very much us and them, even though a large proportion of those who work in mental health have suffered ourselves! Even in the mental health profession, there’s still a lot of work to be done to change attitudes towards mental illness.  ,I still have bad times and do still take antidepressants, but I feel positive about the future and proud of myself. I can’t wait to qualify as a mental health nurse and start making differences to those who are in the darkest places.,Comment below or , and find out ,."
,"During my second year of university, the pressure of exams was looming and I found myself in a place I had never previously been – one filled with ,, feelings of failure and a constant fear that I would never be good enough to embark upon the career that I had worked so hard for.,At the time that my journey with anxiety began, I was putting in 14 hour stints at the library – that seemed like normality for the majority of students at my university. I thought that I was fine - I had always prided myself on my emotional strength. That was, until the day of one of my exams, when I had a panic attack in the library.,It had taken me two hours to read one page and it was clear that something was wrong. I didn’t , to have a panic attack, but I couldn’t stop it and, honestly, I had no idea what was going on. I didn’t know what a panic attack was, but I was left shaking and crying uncontrollably on the quiet floor of the library, 2 hours before what was, in my mind, the most important exam of my life. Of course, it wasn’t - that was the anxiety talking.,I had been revising for two months. I was ready for my exams, but my brain would not let me pass this wall of panic in front of me.,Funnily enough, I actually had no idea that there was a problem with my mental health until the day that I had that first panic attack. Following that, things started to click in to place and I realised that, for the two months prior to that panic attack, revision had taken over my life and I was rarely eating and barely sleeping. My room was a mess (which was very unlike me) and, in all honesty, I was too.,I sought help from my GP, and was referred to the Improving Access to Psychological Treatments service. I was given medication to help to control my anxiety and attended cognitive behavioural therapy, which taught me to change the way I thought. Apparently, doing this means that I am in a minority: a , found that one fifth of people who have experienced anxiety do nothing to cope with it. Indeed, fewer than one in ten people have sought help from their GP to deal with anxiety.,At first, admitting that I had a problem made me feel that I was weak. Once I had come to terms with my anxiety disorder and felt that I could tell those closest to me about it, I found that most people’s instant reaction would be to ask ‘Well, what are you anxious about?’ There was absolutely no malicious intent behind that question, but it was a question that simply could not be answered. I found a quote from Hugh Critchley helpful in explaining what it was like: “If fear is fearful of something particular and determinate, then anxiety is anxious about nothing in particular and is indeterminate.” It can be difficult to come to terms with the fact that you have anxiety whilst at the same time having absolutely no idea why.,Now that my anxiety disorder is behind me and I have learnt to cope with any feelings of anxiety that I may experience, I feel slightly angry when I look back at that time of my life, that I didn’t know that I had a problem until it was too late. If only more people spoke out about mental health issues, and the help available were promoted further, people may not have to wait for their mental health issues to become serious before they are able to receive help.,People simply do not talk enough about mental health issues and, even whilst writing this, I feel a sense of worry that people may look down upon me because of my experience with anxiety. That is wrong. In the UK, one in four people will experience some kind of mental health illness in the course of a year. That’s a lot of people, and I imagine many of those people are frightened to speak about their experiences, for fear of discrimination and stigma.,We need to raise awareness of mental health issues and let people know that it is ok to speak out about their experiences. While I found the prospect of speaking out about my experience daunting initially, it has actually been incredibly refreshing. You never know, you could be the difference between someone staying silent, or attending their GP and getting the help that they need.,Mental health is no longer something that should only be spoken about behind closed doors and I hope that we, as a society, are now moving in the right direction towards a better understanding of mental health issues and a more accepting approach to those who experience them. Only by talking about mental health issues can we raise awareness, and awareness is crucial in enabling those experiencing mental illness to get the help that they need."
,"I said goodbye to my children for the last time last night., As I laid them down in their beds I kissed them three times and said sorry. I told them I loved them. I had convinced myself I would not be here today, because I was going to take my own life. I had gone through such a stage of mental preparation that ending it all not only seemed like an option, but a logical one. It made sense. In my head I was apologetic. Extraordinarily so. I apologised for not being strong enough for them. I told myself they would be better off without me. I was apologising for everything. I was apologising for being me. In my head was every bad thought and black cloud imaginable. The storm was here again. I shut the door. My wife asked me if everything was OK. “Yeah, why wouldn’t it be?”, I replied.,I have long misunderstood depression. It is, of course, different from ‘I am depressed’ - the feeling you get at the end of bag of crisps, or when a crush you like doesn’t text you back. They don’t compare. It is an altogether consuming feeling of emptiness. It takes over your life. For many people it defines them: but it doesn’t have to. I can see them now.. Suicide statistics lit up like an ill-judged Times Square. With the , at its highest since 2001, why are so many of us afraid to get help? And why are so few of those seeking help men? How wonderful it would be to turn off the neon signs, shut out the lights and dance in the rain. Until we were so tired that we couldn’t dance any more. Because we were happy. Because we were no longer afraid.,As someone who has suffered from depression and anxiety I have wanted to write about it for some time, wondering what difference I can make - how I can contribute to the conversation. How I can write about my experience in a way that is less ‘woe is me’ and more about learning, about insight. What is depression? For me it is having just about everything and still wanting to throw it all away. It is the lowest of all places, the lowest of the low. Lower than , in a lowrider. It is going to that place and attempting to fight your way out. It’s coming out of the other side with just enough of you left to tell bad jokes. Awful, awful jokes.,It’s an extreme sense of distance when taking part in conversation. Not being ‘in the room’. Looking into your children’s eyes and feeling sorrow instead of joy. Feeling empty. Feeling nothing. A racing mind. A sense of dread and panic, with or without reason. It’s physical, too. The weight of the world on your shoulders physically weighs you down. It’s a sinking feeling, a gasp for air. It’s a swift kick to the gut. It’s sweat. It’s dread. It’s all of these things, all at once or one at a time. Switching in quick succession. , can be hard to keep track of. It will make you question what is real.,After it’s done toying with you, it will start to kick you when you’re down. Just as you begin to rise you will fall. It will tell you that you aren’t good enough. It will take all the evidence to the contrary and violently shred it in front of your eyes. It will make you think you’re beyond help. That ‘help’ is a special four letter word reserved only for the privileged. A cruel process. An exam which you cannot pass, and one with no answers. You’ll give in, and the wave will wash over you. Each day it will begin again and you’ll try not to drown. If you can learn to do so, it’s the most beautiful of all magic. Your life: lost in the magician’s hat, yet you can find it. Depression itself is the true illusion.,Depression is rarely something that just ‘goes away’. Yet rather than let it consume you, you can manage it. Taking the first step to getting help can be the most frightening thing of all, but I wish it didn’t have to be. I envision the ‘three wishes’ scenario. I wish that anybody going through a mental health problem would never, ever be afraid of asking for the help they need. I wish that mental health had the same level of respect as physical health. I’d wish talking about it wasn’t such a big deal. Perhaps these words are those first steps. It’s OK genie, you can leave now. Perhaps the message that I got help will encourage others to do the same. What a wonderful thought.,The next time you engage in conversation with someone, take an extra moment to be mindful of the words you choose. They too may be weathering a storm. It is rough out there. I said goodbye to my children for the last time last night. I’m such a hypocrite.,I’m still here.,Comment below or , and find out ,."
,"Last summer, my boyfriend dumped me. It was a serious relationship and we were about to get married. It wasn’t a healthy relationship. I used him as my crutch. I told myself ‘as long as I have him, I’ll be fine.’ I knew that there was a possibility he could leave and not necessarily by choice e.g. a tragic accident could befall him.  I knew that when he left, I wouldn’t be able to cope but I didn’t do anything about it. This proved to be a serious mistake.,I became really unwell. I spent two short periods in psychiatric hospital. I came into contact with emergency services so many times that I lost count; it was like I lived in the assessment suite at my local mental hospital at one point. This is because I kept harming myself or, in their words, I kept acting ‘mentally disordered’ in a public place. The emergency staff weren’t always nice, especially some of the police officers. I was an informal patient during both my stays in mental hospital.,What was nice though was being surrounded by people who understood what it felt like to struggle with mental health issues. I met so many people who were diagnosed with various disorders including the ones I suffer from: emotionally unstable personality disorder (EUPD) and depression. I met other people who were suicidal, unable to cope with life, unable to cope with emotions etc. We were like a family. We all looked out for each other generally. I finally felt like I fitted in somewhere. In particular, I remember one woman who had this really dark sense of humour, which I think most people would not get but I got it. This is because she had EUPD like me and I struggled with the same symptoms as her. I did feel a bit triggered sometimes but, for the most part, it was all right. Hospital kept me safe and that was what I needed.,Prior to this, my life was simply unstable. I’d get hurt by the smallest things. I’d start thinking of ending my life over the silliest things. The world was full of triggers for me and I think my main triggers were people. It seemed everything people said and did triggered me. They simply could do nothing right. Coming from a Somali and Muslim background, my family just did not get it.,My turning point in my life was getting arrested for a minor offence for something I did when I was unwell. Even in my custody notes, the social worker said my behaviour was ‘probably due to my emotionally unstable personality disorder.’ I did lodge a complaint against the police for arresting me even though I was unwell and I did the ‘crime’ simply because of that but they explained to me that their hands were tied and that they had to keep me safe. It was a turning point because prior to this, I had never been arrested before. I had always been a law-abiding citizen. I just never imagined that I’d be worrying about having a criminal record. In the end, after contacting the police, I was informed that my record was still clean, thankfully.,Things are stable now. That’s all I can say. I am not going to say I am happy because I am not. I am not going to say all my problems have been solved because they haven’t. I recently started mentalisation based therapy. I also volunteer with a homelessness organisation in London. I’ve dabbled in some other voluntary work here and there too. And currently, I am looking for part time work with a mental health charity.,What has helped me significantly are the following things:,My top tip is to take each day at a time.

,"Even when those closest to me, people I trusted and loved, told me I needed to see a doctor I didn’t listen.,It was 2004, and through no fault of my own, the bottom had fallen out of my world; I couldn’t sleep, couldn’t think straight, every single thought became a negative that grew and grew inside my head until only the worst conclusion was conceivable; but I refused to ask for help. I’d had similar thoughts and feelings since my teens, so I assumed I just had to try and get on with it - and anyway, I was nearly forty… a grown man with teenage children… and men are supposed to be strong aren’t they…?,My work colleagues knew something was wrong – every day the tears would come, and I’d have to leave the room and hide in the toilet until they stopped. I’d go back to my desk, and say nothing, but bloodshot eyes are a real giveaway….,Then one day, quite out of the blue, I knew I had to go to the doctor.,The problems hadn’t gone away, the downward spiral hadn’t slowed, and I don’t think there was an identifiable trigger or a reason for the change… somehow I just ,. I booked an appointment, went along to the surgery, waited for my name to be called, sat down in front of a man I barely knew… and broke down.,Completely.,Eventually I was able to tell my story, and the doctor couldn’t quite believe I’d “coped” (and I use the term advisedly) for so long without coming for help. ,was diagnosed; and that “help” came in the form of trips to a counsellor (which didn’t work… for me), and some prescribed medication (which did…).,After a couple of months I felt I was able to look , my situation, rather than being engulfed , it. The issues don’t magically disappear, but the new-found objectivity did allow me to start to rationalise things – and it also made me realise just how low I had become. For so long my mind had felt like it was engulfed by an immovable black shroud, and was being squeezed until all the happiness had gone…,I fought it so hard… but in the end it needed those little capsules to give me the clarity and renewed energy not just to fight, but to fight back.,Within two years, with the ,, I was able to rebuild my life. It wasn’t that I actually said all that much about how I was, or had been feeling; more the knowledge and comfort that someone (be it a relative or a close friend) was willing to listen if I needed to talk.,I didn’t want sympathy… I’m not even sure it mattered whether or not I was fully understood… simply being accepted (and loved) for just being “me” meant everything. A few months later, I met the wonderful woman who would eventually become my wife and, although there have been some difficult days along the way, the emotional scales are now weighted very much in favour of “happy” and “content”.,Recognising something is wrong is difficult; acceptance is even harder, and that first step to ask for help is the toughest one of all…. but tough and impossible are two very different things, and however much courage it takes, don’t ever be afraid to ask.,Mental illness can affect your life, but trust me it doesn’t have to control it."
,"This year I am going to become a father for the first time in my life: I am looking forward to it, but it also brings with it a lot of self doubt., I am scared that I won’t be mentally ready for it, as in the past I have suffered with mental health problems. I found it hard to cope with everyday things and I hope now I can cope enough with this huge challenge and responsibility.,Now I am at the edge of a new beginning in my life I think about things like: ""how will I manage with the baby?"" And how will I be a 'good' dad? I also worry: ""will I be a good enough partner?"" I hope that I can do everything- I hope that I can to learn how to manage with a baby in our lives but I worry that my mental health could get in the way of having a new family and my work life. I worry if I will keep it together for my baby and partner's sake. Can I be strong enough for them?,I feel right now the support my partner gives me and the confidence she encourages in me will get me through this time and we will work together as a team. My partner also has suffered , and , and I worry for her mental health too but, together, we can support one another through this life changing experience. Through sharing our worries and concerns we will become stronger and closer together. I think talking out about your feelings to someone you can confide in or trust can strengthen your relationship and help you to see that worrying just means you care so therefore you can be a good dad and partner.,I really hope I can do this to show other dads with mental health problems if I can do this, so can they. You can be a good dad and partner, cope and support them with mental health problems."
,"I will never forget midnight the 25th January 2008 as it spilled over into 26th January, my eldest daughter’s birthday, and me waking up with my first ever panic attack., Later that morning I was told by a doctor that it was the final straw in my unknowing battle with anxiety/depression. My illness lasted another three months: three months off , and three months of being determined to live as could not see myself leaving my two lovely daughters and wife without a father/husband. Even so, I often thought of taking my own life as the pain and suffering was so bad.,Being a father was, in many ways, a constant reminder of why I had to get better and do everything in my power to get better. In addition, it made me determined not to be silenced by the , of , and ,, so I told all. In so doing I got the most amazing support and encouragement - essential ingredients to my recovery and why today I do so much advocating and campaigning for the need to break the stigma. , has killed too many; I knew a father (a very good friend) who I think didn’t feel able to speak out because of stigma. It prevented him from seeking the support, medication and counsel he needed to get better – he ended up taking his own life.,My message to fathers out there is don’t be burdened by the stigma - help is out there for you! Instead of people seeing you as weak (as the stigma makes you feel) people see you as being courageous in being able to talk about what is a real illness. We fathers must learn to share our emotions and feelings more. It is only through sharing our feelings that we can get the early intervention needed to flourish and better manage our illness - versus the all too awful alternative of leaving it all too late, and where there only way out seems to leave others behind. That does not need to be the outcome – I’ve experienced mental illness, and I know that there is hope."
,"I wanted to write this blog after I heard the coverage of the , which took the lives of 150 people.,For me, media reporting around the tragedy highlighted the ,and negativity which still surrounds ,, with a damaging narrative being formed that it was depression which drove the pilot to commit such a terrible act.,Depression continues to be a misunderstood illness, people often view depression as a bout of sadness or simply feeling ‘down’, which means when it comes to issues of suicide or understanding someone’s behaviour or actions, it seems those who have never experienced it will never fully understand. This gives the media a great deal of power to present misleading information about the illness.  ,What worries me most about this is that the stigma perpetuated by , will prevent people who really need help from speaking honestly about their illness. I feel that as someone with personal experience of depression, I want to share my story to help change the conversation and promote better understanding.,For me, there was no specific moment where I realised I had depression. It crept up on me like a night creeps up on a day; but in my case the night lingered. It started with me declining invitations to go social occasions with friends, not speaking with someone as often as I once did. Gradually I began to detach myself from my friends. They tried to communicate and cajole me to engage with them but I just wanted to be alone.,Eventually I could no longer comprehend how others so easily carried on living their lives with such enthusiasm, not burdened by this overwhelming sense of insignificance which occupied my every thought, it all seemed absurd to me. The sounds of people talking to each other, the busyness of the streets, everything seemed so loud and unyielding; the din of everyone’s enthusiasm for life became unbearable to the point where being alone in silence was all I could take.,It wasn’t just my hobbies and other pleasurable activities which fell into the abyss, routine responsibilities, which to others are practically reflexive, fell too. The simple task of getting out of bed was beyond my capacity, I could no longer eat regularly or healthily, brushing my teeth and other general healthy practices fell by the wayside.,This way of life became a habit which only reinforced my feelings of hopelessness. It wasn’t sadness, the situational response that might happen in the aftermath of the death of a loved one, it was the hopelessness and pointlessness of life; the futility of living which consumed my thoughts.,It took months for me to finally seek help, but I did it. One day I had a sudden clarity of mind, it was totally unexpected at the time but I’ve since got used to bouts of depression punctuated by periods of normality. My attendance at university had become non-existent, I had rarely communicated with friends and my weight had dramatically decreased. I went to my doctor and was prescribed medication, eventually my life regained some semblance of normalcy, those once brief periods of clarity were mercifully lengthened by the help I received.,This is my personal experience of this illness, it may resonate with some who have similar experiences and it may not with others. What helped me may have helped you too, you may have found something else, or you may still be looking for that help. There is a lot of commonality with depression, but there are a lot of differences too, each one unique to us and our experiences of life. This is an important thing to remember if we are to change the misleading, often negative understanding which clouds conversations around mental health.,I believe our understanding of ,must improve; we have to remove the stigma and negativity and debunk the myths before we can establish a social understanding. Our friends and family will have greater insight into our feelings and behaviours and people will begin to believe it’s okay to talk about their experiences and okay to ask for help. ,- Michael,Follow Michael on Twitter at @_bakhtak_, ,Comment below or , and find out ,."
"Irum, ","I am all about authenticity. I can't stand hypocrisy. Yet I feel quite hypocritical when it comes to one topic: mental health. I'm always retweeting tweets about ending stigma, but I still stigmatise myself. This is probably just because of what I learnt and observed as I grew up, but now I'm aware that there is no reason to continue to stigmatise myself for something that is not my fault. That's something that I am still trying to accept.,Anyway, what I'm trying to say is I am done lying: I have mental health problems. Most people say “I suffer from” and I should probably say that because I really am suffering. But if I'm being honest with myself I still haven't fully accepted this, despite it having been more than 2 years. I have quite severe depression and anxiety. I’ve also had an eating disorder and still have problems with body image. I've been hospitalised a number of times (in an inpatient unit for 3 months in total, as well as in general hospital), which meant I missed a lot of school in an important year: year 11. It was really, really difficult.,I have to endure a million negative thoughts every day, which find their way into my mind in every possible situation. Whether it's waking up or going out with friends, my depression will try to ruin it. It asks me: “Why did you wake up Irum? It would be better if you were dead.” It says: “They don't really like you Irum, no one likes you.” These thoughts are so powerful that sometimes, even when people tell me otherwise, I  can’t bring myself to believe them. ,Against my will, I am a sponge to any negativity or insults I receive from people, yet I seem to have a shield that prevents any positives or compliments getting in. Even though I laugh or say thank you, inside I can't help but feeling paranoid and ridiculed, as if people are lying when they compliment me. This continues the cycle of self-hatred and mistrust. As I can write this I am clearly aware, but there is a massive difference between awareness and change, and that's probably the hardest part of recovering in my opinion. Your beliefs are so ingrained, it can often take years to challenge them successfully.,I'd like to make it clear that I am not writing this for sympathy. I am writing this to fight the stigma that surrounds mental illness. No one hides the fact they have diabetes or cancer in the same way people hide their mental illnesses, and in the 21st century, that's not right.,I am writing this for the sake of empathy, so that people that don't experience it get a small insight into what it's like, and so they can spot the signs in themselves or others and get help. I also want others that do live with mental health problems see they are not alone; there are others that understand. ,So if you want to comment that mental illness doesn't exist or we're all faking it or telling our stories for sympathy and attention, take your rubbish elsewhere. Just because you can’t see an illness doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist. The 1 in 4 people that experience mental health problems aren’t faking it. If they want sympathy, why do so many hide it from their friends and family? Mental illnesses are real and like other physical illnesses they can cause a huge amount of suffering. Feeling the need to hide it and deal with stigma on top of that is so difficult and unfair., Mental illness is one of those things you can't fully comprehend until you experience it, but any decent human being would try. All a lot of us need is some love. Well, that's not all - but it makes a big difference."
,"It’s a couple of weeks since Depression Awareness Week, and after skirting around the issue for a long time, it feels like it’s the right time to open up about my own experiences of , ,Mental health issues are something that I’ve been coping with since I was around 11 years old, but it took me a very long time to even admit to myself I was depressed, and even longer to admit it to my loved ones. So I guess blogging about it is the final frontier in accepting there’s no shame in having depression.,It seems hypocritical of me: I work in mental health, volunteer with Samaritans, and have dabbled in fundraising for mental health charities; I am a vehement advocate of reducing the , surrounding mental health and encouraging people to talk about it; I have empathy and respect for everyone who has a mental health issue. Everyone that was, except for myself.,Even though I have great respect for those who open up about their mental health problems, there are times when I still feel ashamed of my own. I’ll be honest, I feel like by publicly admitting I have depression, I’m admitting some sort of weakness. It’s incredibly scary to reveal your biggest vulnerability like that, and knowing that people are likely to misunderstand, or judge you; it only makes you feel even more vulnerable.,That’s the thing about ,, it’s very subtle to the person perpetuating it. They might not even realise they’re doing it; a flippant comment here, a cheesy platitude there. But every insidious little incident adds up and contributes to the wider culture of stigma surrounding mental illness. This stigma is what keeps people silent about their suffering, and ultimately feeling like they’re all alone.,For me depression isn’t just about being sad for any length of time; depression isn’t an edgy badge of honour pinned to the lapel of a tortured artist. The main thing I think of when I think of depression is exhaustion. When I’m at my worst I can feel the weight of it on my shoulders when I walk, I can barely think straight, I can’t construct a coherent sentence. I would have to take breaks from walking up the stairs, to sit on a stair and just stare at the carpet for five minutes.,In theory, I have no ‘valid’ reason to be depressed. I’m healthy, I have a roof over my head, an education, a job, the most wonderful family and friends, and all in all, a very nice life. However, knowing all that simply adds insult to injury and culminates in a vicious circle: ‘Not only am I depressed, I’m also ungrateful for my lovely life and the people in it, and now I’m even more depressed.’,I would feel incredibly dissociated. I’d sit and look at pictures of earlier, happier times of me with my friends and family and think ‘Who is that girl? She has a nice life, a happy life. That isn’t me.’ I saw life as being abjectly awful, and any nice event or good day was simply a ruse to distract me from the overall abject awfulness of it all.,Different people conceptualize their depression in different ways, but for me I can only describe it as feeling as though I was down a well. Everything within sight was suffocating darkness, no way forward, no way through. I was trapped. At one point I saw no way out of the darkness except by way of taking my life, I'd thought about suicide before, most days in fact, but that was the first time I'd ever been so truly desperate that it seemed like my only option.,I'll backtrack here briefly to say that when my mother first found out about my mental health issues, she was less than supportive. I was 12 years old, it was my first experience of stigma because of my mental health and it was from my mum. It's taken us a long time to get to where we are now, and a lot of trial and error, but she began to understand my depression and was, ultimately, the person who saved me when I was at my lowest ebb.,She didn't even know it, but the next day we talked and she was so supportive, she said everything she didn't know I needed to hear. It felt like she'd reached in and picked me up out of the metaphorical well and I could actually begin to see some hope for the future again.,I see that as a tangible example of how taking the brave step of opening up to someone can change their perception of mental health. It gives me hope that if I share my story, along with everyone else who has pledged to support the , campaign, perceptions of mental health will change and one day stigma will be a thing of the past. ,Comment below or , and find out ,."
,"My , and , started after I experienced a lot of stress in a job that really wasn't for me. I'm young, yet I started to tell myself I would never amount to anything - on top of that I was working constantly, and never had any time to do anything but that. One day I was getting ready to go to work and I had very sudden panic attack: this turned out to be just the beginning of a very long journey. I was diagnosed with clinical depression and severe anxiety by my doctor and, although it was hard to hear, things suddenly starred to make sense. Just having a reason for why I was feeling this way was a huge help.,I spent a long time trying to get back to the person I was when ultimately that was the mistake I was making. I needed to see this through so I would be stronger for it, so I could really see myself at my darkest and still know I was worth the fight. Depression caused me to lose every inkling of your self worth and every little detail in my life became analysed. Depression and anxiety are clever and imaginative; if someone said anything slightly negative or constructive to me it was replayed over and over again in my mind and my illness had more ammunition to fight against me.,This is what I learned on my journey with depression: depression is not part of you, it does not stand with you and does not define you. It is not your friend and it's not part of your personality. I've found that I could best challenge depression by letting my thoughts play out and saying ""oh, there goes another silly thought again"". The most important thing I learnt was to stop agreeing with my depression.,The , is still very evident in our society; once I told a couple of friends how I was feeling and why I was withdrawing myself - they completely ignored me and only came back to me when they thought I was better. Then, when they realised I wasn't better, they ignored me again - this only fed the illness because it was more proof that I was a burden on everyone and that everyone else was better off without me. I'm 24 and I have a lovely home and a great partner, to everyone else I just had no reason to be depressed.,I have a wonderfully supportive partner but he wasn't an expert from day one, he said all the cliche phrases like 'I swear you like being like this' and 'cheer up'. So one day he came to my GP with me and after sitting in on my appointment he immediately got home and researched how to help someone through mental health issues. It wasn't quite the same situation with my parents - in the beginning I felt like they didn't value what I was saying and didn't see it as a serious problem; people find it hard to understand something they've never experienced. But they now understand how difficult it's been and how strong I am for seeing this through.,I'm not weak because I've had depression, I'm strong because I've seen it through and, now I know the signs, I feel braver than ever. I know when depression happens to others I will see the signs in them too and be able to support them.,Overcoming depression is one of the most wonderful feelings in the world, I feel like a completely different person now and like I can conquer anything. There is no miracle cure for depression, you just have to see it through. And the most important thing for you to do is share, share your good days and your bad days, share your worries and your thoughts. There is truly someone for everyone, whether that's a doctor or a friend a partner or a parent. You are valued always.,Comment below or , and find out ,."

I have no idea what bothering you but that’s alright.,Before I ramble on, you are probably thinking, ‘Who is guy and who cares what he has to say?’ That’s fine, but I implore you to stick around long enough to see who I am and why what I might have to say is important. And by no means is this a sob story - I believe in empowering you.,My name is Faris and I live in Liverpool. The reason I came to this country was because I lost my entire family, home - everything else a person could ever care about -in about an hour, almost like they never even existed before, like it was all just a dream. You might think, ‘That’s awful’ or you might think, ‘So what, things happen.’ Either way, it happened and, after it did, you would think things couldn't get any worse, but that was my biggest mistake and my arrogance led to me to be unprepared for the countless tragedies I have encountered, including the time when my close friend took their own life, which destroyed me. I was arrogant. I thought I could ‘fix her’; I thought that someone with that much experience in tragedy, mistreatment and misfortune (as I have had) could reach out to her and, when she passed, I blamed myself for everything and that was an even bigger mistake.,It’s hard being someone’s friend when they are ,, but it is one of the kindest and noblest things one person can ever do for another human being. What I learned is that, sometimes, life is beyond our understanding, but that doesn't mean that we are helpless. No, heck no - it means that we try to the very end.,I don’t know what issues you are facing and, for all I know, the small part of my story that I told you could pale in comparison to what you are going through, but that doesn't matter. I am writing to you because we are connected by one thing, we both suffer from the demon that rides our back every day, a demon that does not respond to questions, does not adhere to logic and seems almost invincible to all attempts of reason. But there is one way to deal with it; it’s to realize that you are not alone. Man, at some points in my life I would have done given anything to have someone to tell me all of this, but I didn't. I am not filled with some false sense of duty, nor did I put my shining armour to come to your rescue. I come to you because I’m terrified, terrified that someone else, someone who I could possibly help, for one second, is stuck somewhere I know too well and want to do everything within my power to get them out.,You aren’t being melodramatic by asking for help and nor should you expect someone to understand the complex chain of events that led you down that dark hole and if someone says otherwise, ignore them, what do they know? Just talk to someone, anyone, once you get over that initial hump of “they won’t understand”, you will realise that they don’t have to, they couldn’t possibly, but they are still there for you. What a wonderful thing.,I want to know that when I am down that dark hole, struggling, if I reach out, I can feel someone else fighting, to give me hope, to give a push to keep at it. Even though you might not think it, everyone in the world needs you, everyone who is down and fighting needs you, and I need you, now more than ever.,Fear nothing and remember that failure is commonly found along the path to success.,Just remember, you're not alone.,Comment below or , and find out ,."
,"I’ve grown up struggling with things the people around me found easy. I barely went to secondary school and, when I did, I was frequently told people forgot I went there. Between 11 and 16 I was in and out of the counsellor’s office and, because I was so young, it was assumed to be all a phase. I went back to the doctor when I was 17 and was put on an NHS course for a disorder I still hadn’t been told whether I had or not. ,I became serious about getting help when I moved to university and suffered serious depression resulting in my dropping out. I had seen a lot of councillors over the years but never really been helped. I felt I could finally see clearly how much I had missed out on and knew that this time, I needed to see someone properly.,Speaking out about this is difficult. When I talk about my depression I suddenly feel people becoming careful around me, as if one wrong word will send me spiralling. When it comes to EUPD, it may seem small as I only have ‘traits’ but it is still a massive effect on my life and I carry the word ‘disorder’ with me where I go. That word paired with ‘unstable’ are not words you want people associating with your personality but I am lucky that I know this disorder is not who I am. It can be hard to believe people will be understanding when your only awareness of EUPD/BPD is it being referenced in Criminal Minds during the suspect profile. The cultural references of depression are not much better. For this reason the stigma has to end and positive images of the mental health need to be encouraged. ,I still have not spoken out about my mental health very much although I do not think it is anything to be ashamed of. Telling my close friends was one of the most productive things I could have done as they encouraged me to seek proper help and have always answered the phone when I needed them. It is sad to see how many people I’ve spoken to could resonate with me straight away as they were feeling the same and it felt like sharing my story allowed them to share theirs too. Being comfortable to talk about what’s happening in your head shows others that it’s okay for them to and helps them get the confidence they need to seek treatment.,The only way to end the stigma around depression and emotionally unstable personality disorder is if we start to talk about it openly. Mental health needs a positive face raising awareness rather than the negative one we all hide behind. It’s difficult to get your head around being so vulnerable to people in your life, or that you barely know, but by being brave we can give these people the information they need to end the stigma.,Comment below or , and find out ,."
,"For me , manifested itself over a long period of time – around 7 years – it all started when I was very badly bullied both and emotionally for most of my ,and left me having no self confidence, no self esteem and, most of all, no self worth. It was impossible for me to make friendships as nobody wanted me around, which left me feeling rejected. I refused to let anyone in who might be able to help in case it brought more abuse my way or I pushed them away as they wouldn’t want “a freak” as a friend.,I started work at 16 where I was treated as an adult and equal by most of my ,, except for some who made me feel as though I was not good enough and that I couldn’t do the job. Again the vicious cycle of self loathing/lack of confidence and no self esteem reared its ugly head. I had convinced myself that if people at school and my colleagues thought that way about me they must be right – and if I was in fact as worthless as they made me feel, what was the point in me carrying on? So at the age of 18 I tried to take my own life twice in a matter of weeks. I continued working without telling anyone and covered all evidence of what I had done until again I contemplated suicide. At this point I lost total interest in my work and felt like I could no longer do the job which again backed up my thoughts of not being good enough so, with no back-up, I quit my job.,I found a new job relatively quickly – hiding from them that I had attempted suicide in case they judged me – and settled in well with a really great bunch of people. Everyday was a struggle and a battle against my own mind – I had more negative thoughts than one person could cope with. The most stressful week at work I’d ever had resulted in me not being able to complete my duties and that -more than any other occasion - proved to me that I was not good enough. The result of that period at work left me having a breakdown and it was then that I found my self unable to move from my bedroom for weeks – the diagnosis? Severe depression and high ,, it had been building inside me for so long that I couldn’t fight it anymore. For weeks I was unable to leave my bedroom and most of the time my duvet was too heavy even to lift. I had no resolve and no drive to do anything and had a constant feeling of rejection because no-one wanted to be around me. I would use so much energy to fight the feeling of nothingness that I would be unable to do anything after that – a feeling of treading water with nowhere in sight and the more I’d fight it the more tired I would be. Unable to work and unable to get out of the house I would repeatedly tell myself that those who made me feel worthless were right in doing so. This went on for just over two months when I decided that work and a routine was what I needed to help pull me out of feeling as low as I ever had done.,After a short time back at work I realised I had gone back too soon and found myself struggling once again to do the work and falling back into the mind set of not being good enough. For the second time in four months, I had a breakdown. The main thing that impacted me at this point was that I could not rationalise anything - if a friend wasn’t able to meet me all I would think was that they hated me and that they didn’t want to be around me. No matter what I did, these negative thoughts were always at the front of my mind and only over time did they start to fade.,That brings me to where I am today; I am now back at work and have been for over a month and doing better than I was 6 months ago. That is down to how understanding my employer has been and also the support I have had from my friends and colleagues. I still have very little confidence/self esteem and still have more negative thoughts about myself than positive ones but the thing I can take from that is that I actually see a few positives in myself. I still have times where I cannot see in my self what others see and I question why people like me and talk to me but I suppose that will get better with time. At the moment part of my recovery is to go out with my friends – even if only for a coffee - in order to get me out an about as I still struggle with my anxiety and the thought of going out without a friend/family member or in fact without a plan scares me to the point I will not go. Every day is still a challenge and a battle, but it’s a battle I am better equipped for now and a battle that I am not fighting on my own.,Comment below or , and find out ,.,If you are experiencing mental health problems or need urgent support you can contact the , on 08457 90 90 90 or by emailing , or these ,."
,"That was three years ago when my , was at its worst. My mind would always overload with panicked scenarios before anything had happened. I was worried enough about breaking the law but the prospect of getting found out by my family was more frightening. I invested a lot of energy into , from others because I was sure that people would treat me differently because of it. It caused terrible feelings of dishonesty and guilt on top of my low moods. Without that added worry, understanding my mental illness would have been a more bearable journey.,Mental illness is as commonly occurring as one in four people in the UK. That’s not something I knew when I was at my lowest. Nobody else seemed to show it so I assumed that no one else felt the same. It was later, when I met a friend who spoke openly about their mental illness, that I began to view my feelings more objectively. , and anxiety didn’t hold such the same isolation as they once did. I was determined that one day I would be able to discuss mental illness in the same way that she could. It did feel strange at first and at times I felt vulnerable to be sharing something that had always been a secret. The more time that went on, the easier it became to talk about and the more I understood it. I couldn’t change the way I felt but I could alter how I viewed those feelings. I’m not sure where I’d be now without the confidence she gave me to accept that how I was, was okay. I hope now that by not being ashamed of how I am might help someone else speak openly too.,There will always be people who don’t understand how it feels and that fact can be hard to accept.

,"Last week was Depression Awareness Week and to raise awareness myself I've decided to write a blog post about it. It shouldn't just be one week that everyone talks about depression it should be every day because if we talk about mental health a lot more we can tackle the stigma in a more effective way. People choose not to talk about depression because of the lack of understanding and compassion in society today. Depression doesn't define who you are as a person.,So imagine this and put yourself in someone suffering from depression's shoes. You wake up in the morning and it requires a lot of effort because you'd rather just stay in bed and hide from the world because you feel there's no hope left. You manage to drag yourself out of bed to attend school/college or work and you paint a fake smile across your face because you just can't explain to anyone why you feel the way you're feeling. They ask ""Are you okay?"" and the answer is always ""I'm fine"" because you don't want everyone to think that you're weak. You feel like you're moving and thinking in slow motion that you're just existing and not living. You just don't know who you are anymore you feel so lost and alone. Your friends and family really irritate you and you struggle to express yourself so you close them out and refuse to let them in to help. It feels like there's a glass wall between you and the rest of the world and you feel so disconnected from everyone and everything. You feel as though you're drowning and suffocating and it's just a constant battle that just can't be won you're tired of everything, tired of fighting, tired of waking up every day with that voice in your head telling you how worthless and horrible you are like an outburst of negativity. You feel like a burden to everyone you know and you just don't feel like you are worth people's time and support. Physically you feel awful you're tired all the time, you don't have much energy some days and your appetite fluctuates. Some days you feel numb you just feel so empty.,Occasions such as Christmas don't feel the same anymore because you just can't be happy and all you want to do is lay in bed and cry because you just don't feel worth it and deserve to be alone. Everyone around you is trying to encourage you and support you but all you can do is be horrible back to them and that makes you feel so much worse. You want to be able to cry but you just can't and when you do try and cry you have no tears. Everything seems too much of an effort. Everything just seems so bleak and there just seems to be no light at the end of the tunnel you feel trapped and imprisoned. You do everything you can to try and get yourself through this dark tunnel but all that effort and hard work seems like a waste of time because all it's doing is making you feel exhausted. You lay in bed at night and your mind just won't turn off all the negative thoughts going through your head and they keep you up until 2am. You've made it through another day and prepare for another day of fighting tomorrow. This is what it's like everyday it just repeats itself and even if it's a good day it still feels cloudy and grey. Depression is debilitating it affects every aspect of your life and you feel like you have no strength left. Put yourself in these shoes and imagine the pain and distress someone with depression goes through.,My message to anyone who thinks they may be suffering from depression is please do speak out. There ARE people who can help such as a GP, friend or even a family member. Depression is a difficult condition to fight and at its worst it can be debilitating. Depression is an invisible illness that nobody can see if you think someone you know may be suffering from depression be that caring friend or family member and ask if they're okay but don't push them to talk as they'll talk to you when they are ready but let them know you are there for them. Depression CAN be treated and there are so many different treatment options available. Please don't suffer in silence. Someone once told me this "" You may have lost the battle but you haven't lost the war."" Carry on fighting this constant battle and get the freedom and happiness that you deserve.

,"This is the story of the last few years of my life - it's about times when I've been unwell, but still felt able to talk about my mental health issues., When I started university in 2011 I began to seek help for a few aspects of my health and well-being that had been bothering me – I found out that I have dyslexia, that I may have ADD, and that I experience , and ,. Searching back through my life during therapy sessions at university helped me to look at the root causes of my mental health issues; my granddad passed away in 2010 and this left a hole in my life. It turned out there was various aspects of anxiety that affected my childhood, and laid the foundations for more serious problems. I went through weeks of counselling with the , mental health worker who really helped me to understand what was going on and what had caused these problems that I was facing. The combination of my mental health and other conditions created a huge tangled web of unexplained problems that will take time to fully understand - that process is still very much in progress.,Later on down the line in March 2014, I took a big step and took a,offer 300 miles away from the only home I'd know for over two decades. This was a great move and the first few months were extremely positive and I felt almost like a new person, however this was short lived as aspects of my living circumstances changed and my workload increased along with the inevitable home sickness that followed. In November of the same year I self presented to A&E on the advice of the NHS 111 service due to intense suicidal feelings - during this phase my eating became disordered and I was isolating myself. Shortly before this occurred (back in the summer) one of my closest friends revealed a plan to take his own life – I talked him round - now speak freely about mental health and we even accompany each other to appointment on occasions.,After my hospital incident, and some heavy intervention from my bosses at work, I called my mum and asked to move back home. A few days later I was back home in the pub with my friends and it felt like a huge relief. There was a financial mess and some problems to be solved but I felt I was in a much better position to tackle my problems and recover, which would enable me to be in a much stronger position in the near future. Right now I am waiting to be assessed for ADD, starting a new job which is more flexible and I am on medication. I am also working to improve my diet and cycle more to fight the big ‘black dog’. There is a long road in front of me but, with support from,, I am almost certain I can recover and live a long and healthy life.,This is just part of my story - there are many more incidents and complex details to it but never enough words. I hold hope that I will untangle the web and eventually will be able to manage the symptoms and challenges I face throughout the rest of my life. As a 23 year old I should have many years ahead of me which, on my best days, really does excite me and motivate me.

I thought I wanted to work in an office, earn lots of money and live the high life; needless to say my priorities were all in the wrong order.,In 2014, after six months of really trying to like being a manager in a telesales company, I’d finally had too much. I had a complete breakdown in my car at a tiny petrol station in Swansea. I sat in my car and considered driving myself to hospital but I knew I was no longer capable of driving anywhere. I considered doing something dangerous, instead I called ,She organised for my dad to come and get me and he bought my step mum with him, someone I’d always thought of as sort of infallible but as soon as she got there she gave me a huge hug and told me all about the time it had happened to her. When they’d taken me home I started thinking about how much better her sharing her story with me had made me feel, so I decided to write a blog post on my own site about my experiences. The response I received was phenomenal; so many people I knew telling me for the first time that they had gone through the same thing, and how much my writing had helped them. People I didn’t know contacting me to say thank you, family members telling me friends of theirs had shared my story with their daughter or nephew or partner, who could relate to everything I was saying and suddenly felt far less alone in their experience of depression.,Subsequently, I felt far less alone too.,It felt great to help people who could relate to my struggle but not only did I help them, they helped me more than I could ever imagine, they gave me the confidence and courage to stand up to the fact that I’d been living life for all the wrong reasons, and to make some much needed changes. I had been living for the weekend, working for my pay cheque and putting my materialistic needs far above my overall wellbeing. I thought that I could fill the huge hole in my happiness with stuff; with bags and shoes and clothes and bottles of wine and cocktails and it was quite a rude awakening to realise that none of this could help, it could only mask for a few moments that I was deeply unhappy, that I hated what I did for a living, that I was twisting and contorting myself to fit into someone else’s pre-determined mold of what success should be and that I was really hurting myself in the process.,My fiancé and I sat down and talked through our finances. We realised that actually we didn’t need to spend excessive amounts of money to be happy, that we’d been trying that for the past two years and look where it had got us - to a place where one of us was signed off work with depression and the other one was trying to cope with the repercussions of mental illness for the first time. I was lucky - I had a supportive network of people around me who encouraged me to strive for a better way of life, who told me that I needed to stop trying to be something that I just wasn’t and they gave me the confidence I’d never been able to find alone; the confidence to turn my passion into my living.,So, I left my job; I decided to follow my heart and become a writer. For the first time I feel so open and hopeful and opportunities are coming my way that I didn’t even know existed before. Sure, I’m living on a lot less but I am a whole lot happier. I know how lucky I am to have a partner who is supporting me while I get my freelance career up and running, but I’m confident that I’ll be able to return the favour one day, should he ever need it. Sharing my story has directly led to my new life, a life full of enthusiasm and hope.

Despite the fact that so many people suffer, they mostly tend to suffer in silence. The second to worst thing about depression, is that even if you DID actually feel like being able to get up and do something, 'seize the day', bake a cake, take a shower etc., you generally manage to talk yourself out of it or tell yourself there's no point, it'd turn out rubbish anyway.,When you're in the depths of depression sometimes you can't even recognise yourself. Food doesn't taste the same, sleep doesn't make you any less tired, conversations seem even more hard work than usual, the sight of your face in the mirror as you plaster the same forced smile on your face you've been wearing for the last few days disgusts you.

As someone who is somewhat of an introvert and doesn’t talk about personal feelings much, the, only makes it more difficult.,I suffer from a mixture of , and ,; sometimes one may outweigh the other but I feel as though they are both fuelled by each other. I first thought I may be depressed when I was in my first year of university. There wasn’t a particular event or scenario which triggered it; it was just there. It felt like nothing but everything – everything was a waste of time, everything bad happened to me, everything about myself I hated. To everyone else, I was ‘normal’ because it became normal to me to pretend that I was fine but only I knew how I really felt inside my head. When I went home during university term break, my mum noticed I wasn’t ‘myself’ and one day I eventually broke down and admitted to her that I thought I might be depressed. I thought that it would lift a huge weight off my shoulders but it didn’t. She immediately bombarded me with questions asking why I was depressed, had something happened, are you being bullied, are you confused about your sexuality, are you finding university too much... the list was endless. I felt a large degree of misunderstanding; it made me question whether I was actually suffering from a mental illness or just over exaggerating or even being ungrateful.,I did end up going to see my GP a while after telling my mum. It was something I was reluctant to do because I knew I would face the same questions that my mum asked which is physically and emotionally exhausting. When I told the GP that I thought I was depressed, she asked me why, I explained. She said she would take a blood test but as I was going back to university in a few days - I left feeling it was a massive waste of time. My mum encouraged me to make an appointment with the mental health counsellor as part of my university’s student services where I filled out a questionnaire rating how I was feeling. I knew I was going to be asked questions I didn’t feel comfortable talking about but I knew I couldn’t keep it bottled up inside, no matter how difficult I found it to open up. At my session with the university counsellor, I was offered counselling or CBT but I wasn’t able to start this until about 5 months later due to long waiting lists and the summer break. The 5 months when I was waiting seemed like the most self-destructive I’ve felt. Every day was a bad day where dark thoughts constantly crossed my mind and I felt as though there was no point to life.,When I went back to university to start my second year, I did eventually start CBT sessions with the same counsellor I saw previously. I talked to her about what I was feeling and helped me understand why I may be feeling that way in order to find a way to improve it. Although only a limited number of sessions were offered, CBT was overall helpful to me. I still have bouts of depression and anxiety and they will never fully go away but, when I think of how I was feeling a year ago and how I feel today, I know I have made progress and continue to do so. Self-help books and just taking a deep breath are things I use daily to help me combat my negative thoughts.,I know that I still have a long way to go and I sometimes feel very reluctant to tell anyone about my mental illness because of the misunderstanding and stigma.

I spent 14 years on one watch in Sheffield – probably the best time of my life.,However, in that period I went to a car crash on the Sheffield Parkway. It was very early one Sunday morning; five kids had been clubbing. Returning home they came down the Sheffield Parkway and crashed. ,Generally I'd be the first to provide assistance. I was just one of those people that just got on with it. But when I got to this crash I felt that ‘I don't want to be here’.  And that was really unusual for me.  ,I hung at the back of the fire engine, getting equipment and passing radio messages. I just couldn’t bear to look at this scene and what was inside it.  ,The mentality in a station is ‘suck it up and get on with it’; ‘we’re heroes not zeros’.  ,It sort of went away. But it was always in the back of my mind. I went to incidents afterwards and, yes I was fine, so it sort-of self-affirmed that perhaps things would get better.  ,However over time I could feel it getting worse and worse. I was not the same at ,, I engaged less with the people at work and spoke less with them. I had got my head down a lot, just focusing on my work.  ,Things started building up and I went off sick for three or four months with ,. I just wanted to be on me own.

I think mental health is still is quite a big elephant in the room and difficult to deal with in the work environment.  ,It makes the conversation difficult, and you can almost feel that you have to throw a line in to change the subject.

You need somebody to poke you and say, ‘Come on, let’s have a chat.’,I have noticed that I tend to feel better the more I can talk about it and the less it's taboo. And it's surprising once you start talking about it how many people have similar feelings.  All at different levels but similar at the same time.,It's not a bad thing, we've all got problems of varying degrees, and we just need to share them. For that stigma to be removed in the workplace and for us to be able to just talk would be fantastic.  ,For me, personally, talking is a release of tension. To be able to speak to a colleague without fear of them ridiculing me or belittling me; to just say ‘I am normal, I just feel differently at the moment’, and for them to accept that is just such a relieving situation to be in. You can feel yourself getting more confident in the workplace as more people understand.  ,We need to create a more open culture, of being able to come up to your mate at work and say ‘I just didn’t enjoy that’, you know, ‘it didn’t go well for me, I didn’t like this, I didn’t like that’, and for them to not belittle that and to not make light of it, but to generally take on board what you're saying. ,For that open culture to be there to be able to do that, it would be fantastic.,Comment below or , and find out ,."

I did, however, make other friends who were more understanding, even if they didn’t understand the mental health issues they were still supportive and tried to help as best they could. Others were not so supportive- I drifted apart from a lot of people because they couldn’t handle my issues and didn’t know how to help. Often I felt a pressure to pretend to be okay and put a front on because I felt I needed to hide the problems I was having due to the fact some people can't handle anything different. That makes you feel more alone.,Through the years I have had a few experiences of unprofessional therapists. In 2011 I had a private therapist who bullied me badly. This made me more depressed and suicidal and put fear into me of opening up to therapists. If you can’t open up to a therapist and tell them everything you need to, you can't work on getting better. Then, after this, I was again abused badly at an anxiety group I was attending by the facilitator of the group. I was dangerously suicidal- she took me in another room away from the group and then instead of helping me she abused me badly, barking 'You need to get stronger! You're weak!' at me and trivializing my experiences and emotional state and putting me down. She was cold, cruel and disgusting towards me. This again could have easily pushed me over the edge but it didn't. At the same time I had a few friends who were treating me very disrespectfully and bullying me: they verbally attacked me and trivialized what I was going through like it was nothing. So unsympathetic.,Sometimes people try to help but they don’t know how. For instance, people tell you to 'cheer up', 'get over it' and say 'it's not that bad!' I experienced all of this and it made me feel extremely frustrated, invalidated, unheard and disrespected. Mental health is a taboo subject- but the more people avoid talking about it the more ignorance and prejudice there is.,Luckily, in 2012, I found a good therapist through an anxiety support charity. By this point my PTSD has developed into CPTSD because of the frequent re-abuse and trauma. I have come on leaps and bounds in the last few years, though, with the right help.

Every single person will be affected by either their own or a loved one's mental illness in their lifetime. Of course they will. The mind is such a complex element of us. How can we expect it to function perfectly all of the time? Isn't that like expecting to get through your whole life never suffering from any 'physical' ailment - not a single cold, sickness bug or broken bone? So why are , who show signs of suffering from ,, ,, , or anxiety, still the 'weird kids'?,If truly open conversation about these issues could become the norm; it would allow the next generation to grow up hearing all the time that they aren't the only ones ever to feel this way or that.

What I , saying is that in my own experience - which is all that I am able to pass comment on - opening up and talking about the way I'm feeling and the things I'm thinking has been the ,thing that has ever made any real difference. That's partly because it's freeing to say things out loud and it can be helpful to hear another person's perspective, and because yes, things often do sound a lot different when you get them out of your head and say them out loud. A lot of what helped me to ,with my hand-washing habit was that when I did finally begin to talk - often just telling a family member why I was feeling the need to wash my hands at that particular time - 9 times out of 10 it made a lot less sense to me when I heard it spoken out loud; so slowly I managed to differentiate again between when it was necessary and when it wasn't.,But mostly talking has helped because, at every turn, every time I have finally opened up about something that I made me feel like an irreparable freak - whether it be to a family member, a friend or a cognitive behavioural therapist - I have learned almost instantly that I am not the only person to have ever felt that way.,Comment below or , and find out ,."

Some people distanced themselves.,This was in 1999.,Fortunately we are now in 2015 and the atmosphere is better. But stigma is still there. We simply still don’t talk about mental health in the same we talk about physical health.

If someone feels we should be ashamed to talk, then that is their ignorance. We should never let the ignorant dictate the climate.,We should talk and listen about depression, because words help us understand. And in the process they help us externalise this agonisingly internal illness. With one in four of us experiencing mental illness (and maybe more, as stigma may be shrinking the figures) we need to recognise mental illness the way we recognise physical illness. As a part of life. And just as there is no such thing as full physical health, there is no such thing as 100% mental wellness. We are all on a scale. These are incredibly common human experiences.

My , tried to warn me as they were witnessing my mood deterioration daily, but I shrugged off all their concerns and soldiered on - after all, I was a qualified mental nurse and this is what we do.

Not 'letting the side down' for the sake of appearance became self defeating, resulting in letting 'the side' ,myself down through my denial and reluctance to seek help earlier. Hindsight is a great thing, of course. I eventually sought help after encouragement from my manager, and started taking antidepressants. Following a few months on sick leave I returned energised and determined to not make the same mistake again.

I was mindful of the stigma I felt, the stigma I experienced from others, and also the support I received. I doubt those who were there for me at the time will ever really understand how their compassion and empathy made me feel. They know who they are. I will always be grateful for this and cannot find the words to express this. It was not all positive, though. One comment from a fellow mental health professional – “it goes with the territory” - intended to minimise my situation and stigmatise me remains etched in my memory and has been a driving force for my anti-stigma work since.,I started delivering talks and presentations to my fellow mental health professionals about my own experiences and to promote Time to Change. I put myself on a platform. I opened up my heart, my soul, and my mind. In 2011 the , was launched and I relished this opportunity to work in the media to change attitudes and opinions. One morning at work I received a telephone call from Fiona, a researcher from the TV programme Emmerdale. Fiona asked me 'Have you heard of a character called Zak Dingle, Lol?' The rest is history. For a year I advised on Zak's 'depression' storyline and suddenly attitudes among my fellow professionals started changing. They could see I was doing something different, unique even. They could see I felt no shame in the work I was doing; in fact, I was proud of it. I had the opportunity to advise as a qualified mental health nurse and as someone with personal experience of depression. I wanted to promote as much sensitivity and authenticity as possible.,Many of them could now watch and recall my own experiences, which they observed at the time, played out on TV. They had been the coincidental audience to my own meltdown and were now seeing this portrayed on their TV screens, through Zak. I exploited this angle and I am not ashamed to admit this. I could see it was an opportunity to make my fellow professionals and the general public think differently about mental illness (particularly mental illness and men).,The feedback was very positive. I was buoyed by this. I talk to people now who I worked with during those dark days of my depression and they are mostly supportive. I have received some criticism about my openness but always view this as positive too. I believe if people, especially in my own profession, are talking about mental health, then they are bringing the topic out from the shadows and into the light. We now move forward with a confidence that things are changing for the better; however, there is still some way to go. We are confident we will reach our destination, eventually.,My own profession has to take a hard and close look at itself and acknowledge the failings where stigma is concerned. We no longer live in Victorian Britain when people were subjected to custodial care, social exclusion and discrimination. Staff in the mental health profession no longer have to adopt a 'stiff upper lip' approach, and the 'big boys don't cry' attitude is as out of date as the asylums and padded cells we have left behind. For their sake, and the sake of those who they care for, change must be made. I made the mistake of stigmatising myself but through adversity can come strength. I am stronger now for knowing this and have learnt from this.,Comment below or , and find out ,."
,"Throughout my younger years, I'd always been the 'happy kid'. , The one that was always smiling and joking. I was confident too, taking part in plays and volunteering answers in class. When I got to the ,, I started to feel 'down', or at least that was how I thought of it. Suddenly I lacked the enthusiasm I once had. I withdrew, I stopped contributing in class, I excluded myself from chats with ,. This was somewhat alien to me. After a quick and concerned internet search, I came to to conclusion that I had something called ','. The description fit like a glove. I was immediately concerned - not about my welfare, but about judgement from others, so I hid it, and not by covering up, but by hiding myself. I withdrew further and further and the further I withdrew, the more I was ridiculed. ,, they'd say. Keeping all these feelings inside was driving me insane. Luckily, I had one or two close friends I could talk to, but the teasing from others was getting too much. I was self-harming, and hit a real low where I couldn't see a future for myself, and I felt like life wasn't worth living. I couldn't tell anyone these finer details; surely they'd just think I was a 'freak'.  I suffered in this way for years.,When I got to sixth form, the depression began to subside, but something new was creeping in. All of a sudden, I started to experience sheer , in everyday life. I found it hard to make eye contact and was terrified of every lesson for fear of having to read aloud/present to the class. I went to university at age 18, which was a huge hurdle for me. Meeting new people was difficult at the best of times. However, I faced many more obstacles than this. I was forced into 'Freshers' week' rituals out of fear of seeming boring, I had to attend seminars where I had to talk in front of large groups of people, and I constantly felt I wasn't 'making the most of the , experience' because doing anything non-compulsory terrified me. By the end of my first year, I became anxious just at the thought of attending my classes. All those eyes staring, judging etc. I began to fear fear itself and so just avoided any situation which would set me off.,By the beginning of second year, I'd had enough of living in such a way. I mustered the courage to go to my university's counselling service for my , (which was, ironically, absolutely terrifying). Although it helped to talk to someone, I mainly just felt ridiculous and that I was making little to no progress. Alongside this, my assignments/seminars/life continued and was unrelenting, constantly forcing me into situations that made me more and more anxious. I was at breaking point, and so I told my , about what I was feeling. I felt guilty for letting them know, almost like I was commenting on their parenting or that I'd failed them in some way. That is why people find it so hard to talk, for fear that no one will understand, fear that people will find them 'weird', and just a general fear of rejection.,I'm now in my third year and I'm finding things tough. Life continues to be unrelenting. I've been told by my tutors to 'smile more' and 'not to be nervous' about presentations. This is why it's time for better education about mental illness- this is why there needs to be better facilities in place for those with anxiety, which is often just passed off as 'shyness'. Anyone that suffers with anxiety will know that it is a genuine illness and impacts the lives of those suffering hugely. It's time that we stop suffering in silence, and speak up. We are not 'shy' or 'socially awkward' or 'odd', and we deserve the same respect/equal opportunities to others. ,
It's time to end the stigma and to start educating people about what is really important!,Comment below or , and find out ,."
,"Now you’ve started reading, I first want to thank you for having the courage to make it this far. It would be wrong, and furthermore reckless, for me to try and guess where you’ve been, what you’ve suffered, and where you’re going in life. I can’t do that. What I can do is offer my blessing that you’ll never be alone in your suffering, even if that seems impossible. Even in the very darkest of moments, the greatest strength WE have is each other. The greatest strength your demons have is SILENCE. Don’t ever forget that.,The story I have to share today focuses mainly on the discrimination I suffered as a student, and the challenges I faced when I dared to speak out. I took control over my ordeal and dragged it out threefold, to prove my firmly held belief that no-one should ever be allowed to make you feel less of a person, just because of their flawed perception of mental illness.,To get the grizzly facts out of the way, I suffer with schizoaffective disorder. I got ill. I didn’t ask for help. I hurt myself. I’m still here.,In the coming days, I got plenty of valuable advice from my local crisis team, amongst which was to be open with those around me. This meant friends, employers, or really anyone who could be said to owe a duty of care. Trouble is, it takes an awful lot of courage to do something like that - courage that you don’t have when recovering from a severe depression. Reluctantly I told my law tutor – a decision I will regret for the rest of my days. She was a really sweet and honest person, someone I knew I could trust. So I told her. She was...spectacular. Were I her responsibility alone, I would be telling a different story right now. The bottom line was, she was told by the college management that I was NOT to talk to her anymore. When she told me, I was crushed: we both were. I wasn’t going to accept this, so I turned to my Senior Tutor for answers. He thought it was harsh, but insisted the decision was made with respect to her ‘as a human being’, and at that point I no longer felt human.,That weekend, a vision came to me in the vivid dreams my condition causes me to experience. It reminded me of how the Nazis dehumanised their victims by shaving their hair, and with it their individuality. At that point, I made a pledge never to stand for discrimination, against myself or anyone for that matter. Otherwise I would never recover. I would always be victim to my own ill health, and so would everyone else after me.,No end of correspondence and meetings with staff seemed to bring any just conclusion. Trying to encourage a fairer approach to students with a mental illness I wrote a report but the principal dismissed it, leaving me feeling small and worthless. I was getting to the end of my tether, and was taking steps towards more formal action, when the principal emailed me back with a dramatic change of heart. He referred my report onto his deputy to arrange a meeting for us to discuss my thoughts and concerns. My persistence had paid off, bringing the first signs of progress throughout my six month ordeal.,I would like to say that my experience has led me not to regret. I can’t. The upside is that my speaking out secured a drastic change in the policy of the college, which means that no future students will have to suffer what I did. The downside is that my soul will forever bear the scars of how my law tutor was treated, how her loyalty was met with pitiless discipline from the senior staff who should have supported us.,I remind myself often, that whilst I can’t rewind what happened to us, the opportunity to have challenged that stigma and discrimination will always be greater than again facing the tyranny of silence.,Comment below or , and find out ,."
,"I was 22 when I was first diagnosed with , - ,by that time I was absolutely beside myself and so deep into my depression there really didn't appear to be even a tiny glimmer of light at the end of my tunnel. ,I was constantly at the doctor with every illness, every symptom of a medical/physical illness you could name; I think I had gone through the medical dictionary from A to Z, missing out D for depression and M for ,, of course. The words just wouldn't come out. Did I know what I had before diagnosis? Yes I did, eventually. Would I admit it? Not on your life; I had three children all under five, I thought they would be taken away from me, I thought that it would split my marriage up, I thought I would be subjected to uncomfortable treatments and go into the local mental hospital. So, I decided I had physical illnesses.,Living wasn't an option, I existed; I functioned, just about. I went to bed at night but couldn't sleep because I was convinced I was going to die in my sleep of a heart attack or the ever growing brain tumour that I obviously didn't have. I got up in the morning, exhausted through hardly any sleep, and then I was worrying that I would get run over– at my most unwell I genuinely believed that the doctor knew that I had a physical illness, but wasn’t telling me about it.,I started to write things down, symptoms of everything I was experiencing, the palpitations, the headaches, the shaking, the tears, being unable to focus, get my words out. It took me weeks to write it all down. I didn't read it back -  it was two or three sides of A4 paper, creased from the many times I had folded and unfolded it, dirty and smudged from the tea stain and the pen marks where I had left my hand rest for too long on a part of it.,I made my weekly trek to the doctor with my paper gripped in my hand inside the pocket of my coat, I experienced the same, familiar clammy feeling in my palm as I sat waiting in the surgery to be called. My head was swimming and I felt the rush of tears before I even went through the door. As I sat down the doctor said, “What can I do for you today, Elainor?” That was it: I couldn't speak, and I started to cry (although it was more like wailing as I remember it). I knew it was now or never.,I passed the crumpled pile of paper over the desk for him, as he passed me the tissues and, even though I had put on the bottom of that letter ""am I depressed?"", I was waiting for him to say “you have two weeks to live” or something else dramatic. He read my pages and he let me cry, and then he said: ""You’re not mad, you’re not going to lose your children and, yes, I think you are depressed, so let's get you better”. My journey to recovery started that very day, when I started to talk about how I was really feeling, a journey I would never have been able to take without that fantastic doctor.,Comment below or , and find out ,."
,"I wasn't very popular with Lang, my wife, on Thursday morning – ,. She very much likes being in bed. We'd gone to sleep quite late on Wednesday night, and got up rather early. While she's never genuinely grumpy, she was perhaps on the spiky side of placid on Thursday. This was made worse when we realised I'd got the time of our taxi wrong, and we'd got up half an hour earlier than necessary.,Our early morning taxi was part of our journey to the ITV studios on the Thames. We're media volunteers for Time to Change, and were to feature on This Morning, talking about my mental health and how Lang supports me. It wasn't really a taxi though, or a minicab - it was ""a car"". It turns out that media people - as we now are - get cars. ""Shall we send a car to pick you up?"". Rather odd. But hugely appreciated.,On arrival, we were shown to the green room. We met a fellow guest, Dr Dawn, who'd be adorning the famous sofa with us, chipping in to our story with her professional opinion. Lang was required for 45 minutes in the makeup room, and emerged like a beautiful butterfly, albeit an insect so heavily weighed down under foundation and hairspray as to render flight completely unfeasible. My face only warranted five minutes of attention.  You can't improve on perfection, but apparently you can stop it shining under the studio lights.,We spent eight minutes in conversation with Phillip Schofield and Christine Bleakley, who must have the most perfect teeth that the world has ever seen. We spoke about my ,, which started with a semi-spectacular breakdown in 2008. I was ill for probably eight months, and at my worst was very unwell indeed; crippling ,, hours crying and daily suicidal thoughts. We spoke about how I'd felt unable to talk to anyone, or be open about the initial symptoms, until it was too late. And how that's a fairly common approach, particularly amongst men; there's a fear of admitting this 'weakness' and self-stigmatising. During the interview, Lang emphasised the importance of being as open as possible, and , in the same way we would a physical injury or illness. And the need for carers to look after - and sometimes prioritise - their own mental wellbeing.,I was very lucky. I was able to access talking treatment through my work, and I had an understanding GP, who was able to prescribe medication that worked for me. I recognised the importance of exercise, and did as much as I could. And Lang was phenomenally kind, patient and understanding. I've made a full recovery. While I've had another couple of minor mental health wobbles, I've recognised the symptoms reasonably early, spoken to my new boss, taken time off ,when I need to, and generally been kind to myself. And - having tried both approaches - I can fully recommend the 'being open' option. It's ok to talk about mental health. You can see the programme ,.,The response to our interview has been awesome. We've done some media volunteering before - I've been on Radio Five and TalkSport, and we've done an interview with the Sun on Sunday magazine. But nothing quite prepared us for this. People have been phenomenally supportive, and it's been - in a good way - overwhelming. Me and Lang mentioned our appearance on Facebook, and we received around 600 emails, calls, texts, likes and comments - all positive. It's been quite remarkable.,We've been most touched by a , saying that as a result of the programme, he's recognised that he needs to talk to someone about his mental health. Another friend publically disclosed for the first time: ,"" - and she immediately received messages of support. One of her friends replied ,It's early days, but we really hope that being open is a helpful and positive experience for them both. A third friend was inspired to write , about her experience of - and slow recovery from - , and ,. People at work have been hugely positive too, and we’re talking about changes we can make to ensure we’re modelling best practice in mental health in the ,.  It's like there are positive ripples from us speaking out, spreading through our network of , and colleagues.,I decided that I'd always be open and honest about my breakdown, and that I'd talk about it when I thought it might be helpful. It's been easy for us - my mental health is really good now, and we don't have the pressure of managing an ongoing condition. And many people don't feel able to be as open as we've been, perhaps because employers, friends or family aren't as understanding as they could be. And that's why it's such a privilege for us to be able to talk about our experience, and - hopefully, and in a small way - contribute to building the momentum around changing attitudes to mental health.

,"I wanted to write this while I was having a difficult time with , myself, kind of as an outlet for myself but also as a way to raise awareness., I find that when I’m not suffering from depression it’s very difficult to look back at the phases where I was and pinpoint exactly how I felt as it is a big blur of nothingness and pain.,I am 24 years old and currently working for the Probation Service running programmes for offenders. With that in mind, I am normally someone who is very thick skinned and it takes a lot to faze me or bring me down. Unfortunately, I have had a number of very upsetting things happen to me in a very short period of time. These events have resulted in me once again plummeting into a pit of depression; there is no other way to describe it. I am currently ,(which I was very reluctant to do as it is in my nature just to carry on and “deal with things”) and I really didn’t want to go back on antidepressants (I have been on them once before). It was a pride thing; I worked so hard to come off them so why should I go back on them again? However my mood has just got lower and lower and I soon realised that I had no choice.,I wanted to describe some of the symptoms of depression that I am experiencing I have seen some doctors over the years that have been brilliant and very understanding and caring but I have also seen more doctors who have been insensitive and made me feel like I was wasting their time. I feel there is a , in society around depression. I am embarrassed to tell certain people that I am suffering from it out of fear that they will say “oh just snap out of it” – a phrase which has been said to me before. People need to understand that if people could snap out of it they would do it in a heartbeat because it’s such a horrible thing to live with.,For me depression is a very real thing, as I know it is for a lot of other people. It is all consuming and completely debilitating. It leaves me feeling hollow and like I’m merely a body without a personality. My low moods come in waves, but when I am feeling at my lowest I can’t communicate with anyone and completely zone out. I  feel like I have a black cloud over my head and everyone around me can see it. I am writing this during a phase where I feel able to communicate – in fact I have just come in from the gym which is the one thing keeping me going at the moment. It quite literally picks my mood up for a short amount of time. It is very difficult to get out the door and to the gym but I make myself always saying to myself “I can’t let this beat me” and I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone else with depression.,Depression for me completely stops me living a life I would normally lead. I am crying daily for no apparent reason and have no motivation to do anything. If I had it my way I would stay in bed all day however I am lucky enough to have support around me and enough people checking I’m okay that I wouldn’t be allowed to do that! I live with two of my best friends and they would come into my room and coerce me out of bed even if it was the last thing I wanted to do; I’m very fortunate to have the support that I do.,The main reason I wanted to write this was to get how I’m feeling off my chest but also on the off chance that it might help someone else. I am not someone to dwell on the bad in life, however, this time my brain and body is giving me no choice but to stop and look after myself instead of ploughing myself into the ground by going to work and ignoring the issues. It is extremely scary and it is very easy to fear that you will never get better because how you feel is so horrendous. Right now I cannot ever imagine standing in front of offenders and delivering groups again. However, I know I will - I’ve got through it once before, I just need to give myself time to heal. Thank you for taking the time to read this and I hope it helps even one person. You will be okay."
,"One of the hardest things I’ve ever done was try to explain my mental illness to ,. ,I’d been struggling for upwards of two years before I built up enough courage to tell her. After ,, I had one of the worst years in terms of my mental health; after my , became out of control and I found myself regularly thinking about taking my own life, I decided that I needed to seek help. I referred myself to the counselling service at my university and, at my first appointment there, I was advised to see my GP to look into perhaps starting a course of medication to help with my treatment.,I couldn’t find the confidence to talk to my mother, so I instead wrote her a letter and posted it home. When she received it, she couldn’t stop crying for days. She phoned me a few days afterwards, because of course she had a few questions – but the conversation didn’t go the way I would have ideally liked. Instead of accepting that it was an illness that needed treatment just like any other condition, she blamed the stress of my education and even asked if anything she did wrong whilst I was growing up had contributed. Of course, this was only due to a lack of understanding, but it made me feel so much worse because I realised that – as I’d feared - she was blaming herself.,If I could have that conversation again, I’d do things very differently. I’d explain that mental illness is usually caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, and is essentially a chemical imbalance in the brain – not something that can be solely blamed on another person. I’d explain that, if anything, my education acted as a welcome distraction. I’d explain that, even though she didn’t realise that I was struggling at an earlier point, this was not her fault because I dedicated a lot of my time into hiding my low moods and covering any evidence of self harm. And if I could ask her to respond differently, I’d have suggested that she do some research on the symptoms and causes of depression before talking to me about it or making any assumptions. I would have asked that she perhaps , and directed her to a ,. I’d have asked her to not blame herself, because although that’s a natural reaction for a mother to have, it didn’t help the situation and in fact made me reluctant to discuss it with her again.,I hope that soon, with the help of the ,, , who has no experience of mental illness will be able to offer their support and guidance to loved ones who do. I have some incredible friends who have literally saved my life on several occasions; not all of them have firsthand experience of mental illness, which proves that the ability to be supportive or empathetic isn’t only a consequence of going through it. There is ,and particularly psychiatric medications, but it’s important that people realise that mental illness is very common. , at some stage in their life, so I believe that it’s time to get educated on the topic. Hopefully as a result, everyone will be well-equipped to react in an appropriate, supportive and constructive way when a loved one opens up to them about their struggles."
,"I recently ,., In the past I have experienced , which I feel has always held me back from being open. However, since writing and sharing my experiences the positive feedback I have received has been overwhelming. I believe that people being more open and raising awareness can contribute to lowering the stigma surrounding mental health issues, and also encourage people to speak out and seek help., I always felt inferior and intimidated by other people. With age this only got worse however, at first, I was able to hide it well. My feelings of self hatred grew and affected my thoughts and behaviour- I was constantly down, had no motivation to do anything and wanted to withdraw from everyone and everything, but I kept it to myself. It got to the point where I couldn't hide it from anyone, and when I was 20 years old I was diagnosed with clinical ,. I hid it from as many people as I could as I didn't want to feel a burden, and I was aware and had seen the stigma attached to mental illness. As I began to open up, the response I received was mixed. Many people were fully supportive and were there for me when I needed them- whilst a few others didn't understand as they felt I had 'nothing to be depressed about'. Just because you can’t see a mental illness as you can with a physical condition, doesn't mean it isn't there. However, some people seem to believe that as it's in your head you can control it. That couldn't be further from the truth.,After my diagnosis I was put on anti-depressants but was already caught in a downward spiral before they had time to kick in. I had completely lost control of my mind. I would wish to not wake up in the morning and I thought about taking my own life. I kept this to myself as I had seen how people felt suicide was selfish and didn't want people thinking that of me. I was also worried about what people would think of me, worried that I would become an outcast in my , group. During the worst stages of my illness I attempted to take my own life three times. I was even named an attention seeker, one of the worst stigmas I feel that there is.,One of my saviours turned out to be simply opening up to people. As well as being on medication, I began seeing a therapist, and opened up to my ,. Although they may not have fully understood my illness they were always there if I simply needed someone to talk to or someone to distract me. , about my illness has been one of the most helpful things I have ever done for myself, and I hope other people with mental health issues can gain the courage to do the same."
," and loneliness go hand in hand., The sense of crushing isolation it can bring is as much a physical pain as it is a mental one. Actions so everyday as walking down the street, ,, going to work, all became part of a very elaborate performance that, come the end of the day, would leave me exhausted. The sense of detachment and unreality leaves you so cut off from the outside world, that it is all too easy to fall in on yourself and ignore those who care for you. Depression is a selﬁsh illness, and one which feels like it entirely consumes your very being. It has taken me over a decade to realise the destructive consequences of not talking about your mental health.,I have suffered from depression and , since I was 14 years old. It was initially dismissed as the ,, and I was all too eager to agree. I had exams to pass, achievements to gain; too much was expected of me for me to have time for feeling sorry for myself.,Ignoring my illness proved to have a devastating effect not only on my own confidence, but also on those around me. Ten years later, it is only because of campaigns like , that I am ﬁnally able to confront my illness for what it is: an illness, no fault of my own or anyone else.,I signed the , with one word in mind: honesty. I pledged to be honest with those around me about how I was feeling; to give them insight into the terrible, black and lonely pain that is depression, so that they might be in a better position to help. The pledge has also changed my own attitude towards my illness; it has made me more aware of when the depression is talking, of when the clouds are moving in and I want to shut people out and retreat. As much as I crave to stay at home, staring at the ceiling, fully immersed in my own silent mental agony, I remember that ,, and that I am not alone. It has gently encouraged me to actively and mindfully let people have an open conversation with me about my mental health, rather than maintaining the ridiculous pretense that I am absolutely ﬁne.,I used to wish that I could wear my illness like anyone can wear a sling on their arm, for all the world to see. I thought that I never could share with anyone how I was feeling, for the shame, the stigma, the admission of weakness. Now I can see that my depression has made me a far stronger person, and one who is always ready to have the conversation about mental health."
,". Mental Illness., Three words that cause people to treat you differently, that make you stay quiet and tell yourself this isn’t happening. This isn’t you.,Depression is not like a fever or a cold: it doesn’t just go away. It lingers. I had a fantastic summer this year. I worked abroad, I went backpacking, I saw my friends, I got to drive. I was happy; the happiest I’d been in a long time anyway. My anxiety was near non-existent but it was always there, watching from the sidelines. When term started in October I had a new plan; it needed to be better than my first year at university. I was going to be OK, I was going to beat it. Then work hit, a massive increase compared to last year, I started to struggle, I got behind. I went back to old self-harming habits; I was in a bad place. Then I started missing lectures - enough lectures I had to tell my tutor what was going on. I had to go back to counselling, had to build a support network, had to start taking action if I wanted to keep the lifestyle I loved.,During my first year I’d found my work load hard to handle; I’d suffered from panic attacks (though that wasn’t anything new) and, finally, I signed up for counselling. To those who haven’t been through it, that doesn’t sound like much but when you spend every day terrified someone is going to notice you’re not ok, it’s a big step. It’s acknowledging that everything isn’t ok and that you can’t do this on your own. Counselling was painful; I find talking about my problems difficult. I’m scared what people will think and that they’ll treat me differently. Last year I told three people about the panic attacks and that wasn’t easy. However, talking to a counsellor - someone that doesn’t know you - is actually really helpful. I think that is why I managed my first year: I passed with a high 2:2 and although my tutor wasn’t thrilled, I was. I could come back.,This year, when things started getting tough, I knew I had to build myself a bigger net. This started with telling my tutor what was going on. He’s a nice man but I’m scared of people knowing. Luckily, he tried to understand. His response “take as much time as you need” showed he hadn’t dealt with students like me before. Anyone that knows about depression, knows that my condition varies daily and time off doesn’t necessarily help. On the other hand, I’ve now got extra help.,The next part of my net was friends. The three from last year had grown a little distant over the summer. The first people I confided in were close friends though I didn’t manage to tell them in person. Writing it down is ok, but saying it tears me up. I also have to admit that both times I wasn’t sober. Both friends have helped and, due to their positive reactions, I’ve had more confidence and have managed to confide in more people. Most people that care about you want to help. I mean, I’ve had days where I’ve curled up on my sofa and cried because I don’t know what to do or who to talk to. However, when you explain your day, most friends’ reactions will be to support you in any way they can.,I may have a support net now; friends, an understanding tutor, a great GP and a fantastic counsellor but it’s still tough. This week I managed three days and that’s an improvement on the last few weeks. Talking about my depression is the best decision I could have made and despite the feeling that I’m still a mess, I’m still here and without my support net, I might have taken my own life, and I definitely would not be at university. Thank you to the people that have been there."

They never showed it, at least not to me.,I think my wife has sheltered a lot of it from them. My extended family made frequent phone calls offering concern; my brother was worried that I would decline deeper and deeper into myself.,I suppose I did and at the time had to.,A couple of years ago I made a film with my wife for Mental Health First Aid and I watched my wife being filmed, talking about how she had supported me. She also said how it had affected her; this was the first time I had heard this and I found it very upsetting.,With depression you become like a rubber mould for plaster of Paris, turned inside out not really recognisable.

,"After a year and a half of balancing a variety of pressures, I snapped., From being there for two unwell relatives - one with a mental illness; moving to a new town away from friends to working unsociable hours preventing me from building a social life and other life struggles it all eventually got too much. It was at this point that I began to understand just how much mental illness can affect someone.,Coming from a South Asian medical family was sometimes difficult. My family held the view that - ""people with mental illness are dangerous, avoid them"", so my awareness/perception of mental health problems was quite limited.,90% of the time I would go to work feeling fine, but evenings and weekends were difficult. I kept getting negative intrusive thoughts of ""you are a terrible person"" and ""you are a failed human being"". I tried everything recommended in the ""dealing with depression"" leaflets at GPs surgeries: exercise, inviting people out and trying to build friendships, focusing on work and smiling a lot. But I was still struggling to sleep and revise for my exams. I didn't feel like eating and I ended up getting severe neck pain which I believe was psychological knock-on effect from the stress. I started to feel worse and worse and after repeatedly self-harming I started planning a suicide. I wrote my goodbye letters and got everything in order, I even made an attempt.,I didn't seek help because I felt as though I couldn't talk to my GP. He was a doctor of South Asian origin like my family so I was worried that he might judge me. Eventually I began to open up to a friend I was close to, but I found it difficult to tell her exactly what I was going through. She shared her own experiences of having counselling and more importantly made me realise that mental illness is indeed an illness - you can’t necessarily snap yourself out of it. If you break your leg, you need to rest and slowly get your strength back. The same principle applies when you have mental health issues.,Accepting that it was an illness helped. I started researching strategies to deal with the negative thoughts and I have made an appointment to see a counsellor. Using a free online CBT website has helped, as did taking some time out and accepting that my mind needed time to recover. Being more open with those around me and accepting that there was a problem was an important step in my recovery.,Eventually, things got better and I am back to revising for postgrad exams and working normal hours. Things aren't perfect, but I’m getting there and I feel more able to deal with stress and negative emotions."
,"Recently I was talking to someone about mental health and they asked me whether stigma really exists. ,After staring at them in bemusement for a few seconds, I said yes and made a poorly constructed argument until they walked away.,Here’s what I wanted to say..., And I can prove it with a story about me. Well, two different versions of me.,At university I was a mental health doubter. I thought people with depression needed to pull their socks up. If anyone did anything slightly out of the ordinary, I wouldn’t think twice about chuckling and calling them “mental”. And, most embarrassingly, I once attended a summer ball dressed in a distasteful , inspired mental patient outfit – hospital gown, vacant look, the lot.,If you had called me up on my behaviour back then I would have argued it was all a joke and that I wasn’t really hurting anyone. I genuinely believed that. I don’t (and didn’t) consider myself to be a mean individual, but without really knowing it I was blindly perpetuating the cycle of trivialising mental health problems and the experiences of the one in four people every year who live with them. ,So why did I think it was OK to act that way? Was it stupidity, or stigma? Whilst it was clearly a bit of stupidity on my part, I really believe that there was and still is a wider problem that I was part of - my attitude reflected the ingrained stigma against mental health problems which is still, sadly, all around us. ,I didn’t know anyone with a mental health problem at university. However, I also didn’t know anyone with cancer, heart disease or diabetes and I didn’t make jokes about them.,Part of it for me was fitting into the unhelpful stereotype that men must be men, that we all should just shake off our low moods and that it’s a weakness to open up and be honest about how we really are. ,So, here’s where the story of the second me begins.,Like one in four of us, nearly two years ago I experienced a mental health problem and was diagnosed with depression. Fortunately, I spotted the symptoms very early and was able to get support from Cognative Behavioural Therapy and my patient, understanding girlfriend.,Unfortunately, however, the only reason I was able to spot those symptoms so quickly was because I'd been through a difficult couple of years prior to that which saw my uncle take his own life and my father experience a severe and debilitating episode of depression. ,My uncle was a jovial army man who lived in Newcastle with fellow retired servicemen. As my family live in the south we spoke to him infrequently, so conversations remained light and his state of mind was never raised. His death was as much of a shock to us as the idea that he was ever experiencing a mental health problem.,Nearly a year later my mum told me that my dad had depression and had been dealing with it alone and in silence, undiagnosed, for eight months.,Two comments that stick with me from my dad during his experience were when he said he was “too old to be suffering from depression” and, after his first session of group therapy, “everyone there was just normal.” If they aren’t the words of a man brought up in a society founded on misconceptions around mental health, I don’t know what are.,Mental health problems do not discriminate, we do. It’s important that we stop so we can start delivering the message that it’s OK to talk about it.,The second me is a far cry from the first me in this blog, but I’m just disappointed it took so long, and so many sacrifices, to see that my behaviour and attitude was wrong.,I urge everyone not to wait until mental health problems directly affect them before starting to talk about it. I’ve personally seen how a caring environment free from trivialisation can give people the courage to speak up and look out for one another, which is ultimately in the best interests of us all.,Talking helped with my problems. Talking sooner could have helped my dad much faster. And talking openly could have helped prevent my uncle from taking the devastating decision to end his life."
,"I am a very lucky person. ,For most of my adult life I have had many friends around me. But for years I felt like the loneliest person in the world. It is only now, after having gone through years of treatment that I have realised that it was only myself that I had to blame for my loneliness. For the most part I found that my friends and family have been supportive to me in recovery and it was only my own fears and insecurities that was making me push them away.,For nearly a decade I have struggled with , and , – this has lost me places at university, jobs and in some cases, friends. For nine of these ten years I tried to keep everything inside, I told almost no-one about my problems – or if I did it was the bare minimum, leaving out the torment that was raging about inside me. I was terribly ashamed of what I was going through, convinced that others would think less about me if they really knew what was going on.,It was only about a year ago, after hitting rock bottom and the second major overdose in a few months that I decided I had had enough. Before I had been only flirting with recovery – not really trying, not really wanting it. But now it was different. I wanted recovery, not because anyone else wanted me to but because I wanted to do it, for me: that was one of the key things that allowed me to make the progress I have made. The other key aspect of recovery was honesty. For the first time ever I was totally open about what I was going through, I wasn't ashamed of what I had been through because I was beginning to realise that it was actually shaping me into a stronger person. To my absolute surprise I discovered that instead of people being horrified about my mental health problems people were actually pleased that I was beginning to open up. Being honest about what I was going through allowed people to actually understand what was going on with me and that meant they could support me more appropriately. And more importantly I was accepting of that support.,I honestly wouldn't have made it to where I am today without the support of others around me. I have lots of very good friends, some without eating disorders that have been there stoically for me throughout the years, regardless of how much I tried to push them away. I have newer friends I have met through treatment who have inspired me to realise that it is fine to recover: I'm not going to magically lose a part of who I am by recovering. Because I have been able to enjoy more activities in my normal life I've also made new friends through these activities – which serve as a brilliant distraction and just a reminder of how nice it is to be just ‘normal’. And then, of course, there is my amazing, dedicated family: they have cared for me despite the horrible times I have put them through. At times I've also tried to push them away but they have always let me know that they are there whatever the weather.,Some people are very sceptical of friendships made in treatment, particularly by those people experiencing eating disorders. But I honestly don't know where I would be without the people I have met on my recovery journey. Being able to support others too has been hugely motivated me towards recovery, knowing how much the support, advice and inspiration of others in recovery was for me I get a lot out of being able to pass on what I have learnt to others. I hope to be able to do this professionally in the future as a mental health nurse. "
,"Writing this through tears and so many feelings, one thing that never got away was my love for my daughter.,She needed help, from me and other people. My view from day one was that she was ill, not mentally ill.,I believe I was lucky in as much that a number of high profile sportsman were talking openly about it which made me more aware of mental health problems. I had heard a number of very good radio shows on the subject, had also recently read Jonny Wilkinson’s autobiography, where he talks candidly about his struggle with it. Driving to be the best, constantly pushing for perfection, doubting your ability, my very own Jonny.,Via text and email, Annie let us know about her mental health problems. Having to read it myself and then read it aloud to her mother over the phone hurt us all.,We finally spoke about midnight, through a lot of tears! We reassured her of our support and love.,We finally got together about three days later. I left all the tears and emotions to her mum, and when she left I just held her and said that this is the first rung of the ladder -admitting the problem.,I knew she would come down, as witnessed on a family holiday to Greece a few months later. This is not a quick fix.,I feel all I did was to be a father that wanted his daughter to get better. Yes I did read up on stuff:  it helped me to understand what she was going through.,I still watch her now, but now I know the signs. When I detect a wobble I just look and say stop.,Are we closer? Yes, we make time more for each other now which is so important.,March 2012 was the month that everything came crashing down, but also the month that turned my life and outlook around. My dad was there throughout it all and still plays a role in keeping me on the straight and narrow.,I had been struggling with depressive/stress/anxiety issues for quite some time. Sometimes knowingly, but for the most part, not so much. Repeated trips back and forth to the GP to see if I really did have a chest infection to explain the constant tightness, sternum-stabbing-pain and general wheeziness and fatigue.  Repeated cancelling of social engagements because I couldn’t face anyone or anything, choosing instead to curl up in a ball on the sofa. Struggling through work, being told again and again that I wasn’t good enough, that my boss was extremely disappointed again, despite putting my all and endless hours into it. Mastering the art of putting a brave face on things; good ol’ resilient Annie. Putting pressure on myself to be everything for everyone and to do everything perfectly so I could feel something like enough.  ,After another couple of days off work, wanting to shut myself away from it all then being physically ill, I hit such a low point that enough was enough. So I sat down one evening, skipping another outdoors boot camp class, and sobbed my way through writing my ‘coming out’ email. Perhaps not the most ideal way to tell people but at the time it was the easiest way for me to organise my thoughts and to finally let people in.,I know it was hard in particular for my dad and mum to hear about what had been going on and just how bad I had been feeling. I had both of them in tears on the phone that evening, wondering why I hadn’t said anything sooner, wanting to know what they could do, and explaining that I would never be a failure in their eyes.,On my dad’s part, he was nothing short of amazing. Never judgemental or critical. He was always there with an open ear to listen, and frequently arms if I was having a bit of a dip. I knew I didn’t have to hold anything back which was hugely valuable as I started a journey of what turned into a year or so of therapy – professional and complementary, medication and all-round soul searching. I also knew that he could see straight through me if I was pretending that everything was ok.,He took the time to read up about depression, its causes and approaches to overcoming it, flagging books and articles that he thought would be of interest to me. He was there as I went through a 16-week CBT course and started regular reiki sessions (a Japanese technique of stress reduction), often waiting over a cuppa or a pint. He actually ended up learning far more about mindfulness and reiki than I still do today.,Above all, he helped to keep everything in perspective – and still does as I feel myself edging towards old habits of trying to do and be too much. His advice of ‘just be’ has stuck with me and we’re far closer friends than we probably were before.  ,‘Coming out’ and talking about mental health problems shouldn’t be regarded as being brave or courageous. It should be normal, accepted, like having a whinge about a headache or a bad day at work, or colleagues checking up on your recovery of something purely physical like a broken bone or bout of flu.,The last two-and-a-half years have held some of the hardest times of my life, but these have really been a blessing in disguise. I’m only able to say that now, as I’m pretty much back to a regular state of mental health. I have a much more realistic outlook, am much more accepting (and proud) of myself, and set myself far more realistic expectations – and accept that that is good enough. I still have dips, but am aware enough to acknowledge them and seek help when I need it.,To my dad, for his advice, support and thoughtful words in making this happen, I will be forever grateful.  "
,"The pit in the stomach. , The realisation it has come back. I feel ashamed, annoyed and angry at myself. How did I let this happen? Why have I let this happen?,I’m talking about depression. That feeling of not wanting to wake up in the morning. Not wanting to make small talk and isolating yourself. Not wanting to get dressed or do your hair. Finding your appetite has gone and you no longer find joy in cooking (and anyone who knows me, knows I love cooking).,That’s the thing with depression. It’s like a cancer. It can come creeping up on you and before you know it, it can affect you physically, behaviourally and emotionally. Depression isn’t something which goes away and stays at bay.,I decided to write this blog because I have had numerous conversations with colleagues in the mental health profession about wellbeing. We see great importance in self-care (which will aid us personally and professionally) and we are passionate about our work with people who have mental health problems. Mental health problems are very normal (they affect 1 in 4 of us at any one time) and they can affect us in different ways. I know for me, I initially found myself putting much expectation and pressure on myself to not think about the times I have experienced poor wellbeing. However I have learned to be compassionate and focus on what I can do, rather than holding unrealistic expectations.,I recall pondering about my past experiences after returning from an appointment recently. I hadn’t left the house in just under a week and it dawned on me, I began to remember the time I felt anxious being out in public. I was worried what people were thinking, I thought everyone was looking at me and I remember thinking that I did not want to be out in the world; I wanted to lock myself in my house. Although in the present day my isolation was attributed to being inundated with work, I was reminded how important self-care is. When we enter therapy, when we read self-help books, when we see friends and feel supported we receive reminders of how important it is to make the time to go for short walks, to go and get a coffee and read a book, to experience a change in environment. This acts as a reminder to take 5 minutes every other day to engage in mindfulness; to be mindful of my emotions and mindful of my thoughts.,I chose not to receive support from my GP or mental health services in the past for my wellbeing. This was mainly because I thought I would be held in a secure hospital and I was scared. When at the age of 16 my GP asked me if I was hurting myself I was embarrassed, ashamed and mortified. This led to me wanting to leave the GP surgery as quick as possible, not to mention denying it and never returning. As part of the training programme I am enrolled on, I too attend my own therapy. During this experience I’ve come to place great emphasis on an awareness that wellbeing can affect any of us; psychologist, GP, banker, cashier, teacher, mum, or brother. It’s important to be compassionate; compassionate in the relationship we have with the self and with others. By talking about our wellbeing we find ourselves giving ourselves to others. We give share empathy, compassion and experience and this I have found leads to us not feeling alone, or abnormal (when we find ourselves feelings low in mood, anxious, etc).,Having worked in Children and adolescent services and adult primary and secondary care services I now know and would like to share that there really isn’t anything to be scared of when you consider accessing therapeutic services. It is unlikely if you disclose experiencing mental health problems such as depression, anxiety or self-harm you will receive a negative reaction. Just like you, mental health professionals are people too. We experience low mood at times, we also may have a history of mental health problems which we have overcome, and we also care about you.,I believe it’s time for us to work collectively to eradicate mental health stigma and I believe we can start doing this by not only letting clients, family and friends know they can talk about their wellbeing, but speaking with colleagues, and speaking out about our wellbeing. I want you to know, it’s time for change."
,"I have the most wonderful friends., They accept me for who I am, don’t judge me and are always there when I need them: I am blessed in that department. ,I did worry about talking about my mental health issues amongst friends. What if they didn’t understand? What if they were scared? What if they didn’t want to be my friend anymore? You see, I was brought up to not talk about feelings and emotions, not to let others see how I feel or know what I think. To keep myself completely private. An isolated island repelling hostile tides.,I personally find it therapeutic to talk about problems or issues though. Trying to keep everything bottled up tends to make my brain go into pressure cooker mode and the anxiety of waiting for it all to splatter out in a messy explosion is not good. So, thinking I couldn’t talk to anyone about mental health, I just used to write my thoughts and feelings down. A shrouded secret. Me against the world. Me against myself. This helped me but I still felt I was the only ‘different’ person treading water while a sea of sane people ebbed obliviously passed me. I decided I shouldn’t keep that part of me disguised anymore. I pride myself on my honesty but how honest was I being if I didn’t mention or talk about my depression to my friends? How did I tell them? A big announcement? An ad in the paper? Nothing so dramatic. Chatting with a close friend I dropped into our conversation that I was being referred to a counsellor by my GP. I explained I had depression and was finding life a bit overwhelming and difficult for me to cope with at times. My anxiety kicked in straight away: had I just made a fool of myself? Was she going to look at me differently from now on?,Of course she didn't judge me, she’s my friend. A rational brain would have told me that but I don’t have one of those. She was surprised (even though I have depression and anxiety I’m a jolly person outwardly) but totally supportive. I felt relieved. I’d stopped treading water and was gently bobbing with a life-jacket on instead.,This gave me the confidence to be open about my mental health. I wrote a blog about my brain and how ‘wonky’ it is and I published it on the Time to Change website and Facebook for my other friends to read. Again I was apprehensive when hitting the ‘post’ button. Would I haemorrhage friends in mass ‘unfriending’ activity? Of course I didn't: I have lovely friends. My brain was being irrational again. It does that often, it’s the default setting.,I had lots of supportive comments on my ‘wonky brain’ post, and a few friends ‘came out’ to me as having mental health issues themselves. Reading and hearing other friends’ stories and experiences was like being wrapped in a warm fluffy blanket. While cuddling a kitten. I wasn't alone. People understood. And still wanted to be my friend. And why wouldn't they? I don’t mean that in an arrogant way –I mean why would they stop wanting to be my friend? I hadn't changed or morphed into someone else: I was still the same person they knew before I revealed I had a ‘wonky brain’.,I feel more relaxed with my friends knowing. I don’t have to worry about making up excuses if I can’t do something or go somewhere if my brain is playing up. I can just say ‘I’m having a wonky brain day’ and they are cool with that. If I’m feeling really low and need to talk to someone I have friends I can ask to come around or friends online I can chat to. Sometimes I just need some alone time to reboot and knowing I have great friends I feel confident to say I don’t want to see someone without feeling guilty or negative towards myself.,Communication is key. Other people can’t read my mind – thank goodness – so it’s important that I can ask for my friends help when I need it. I’m so glad I found the courage to talk about my mental health. My friends have helped me so much. Sometimes they don’t even realise how much they have helped me: covert support scattering my negative ninjas.,I recommend talking to someone whether it’s a family member, a friend, lots of friends or someone online from a forum or help group. It might seem scary but if you unlock the door of doubt you too can bob blissfully in a life-jacket instead of just treading water. It really is good to talk. And use lots of metaphors."
,"The number of times people said to me, “Come on, you have everything, you have nothing to be sad about just cheer up!” or “what happened to make you upset?” These questions are seemingly innocent but they hurt when you can’t answer them. That’s the issue with mental health stigma, it is born of people not understanding, therefore without more understanding the stigma will never be broken.,Some people I have talked to still do not believe that depression is serious and can be debilitating, when someone says something like this it hurts but I try to explain to them what it’s like and this is what I am going to try to explain here.,I went from a good student, attendance was near perfect, obtaining good grades on every coursework and exam. Then depression hit, I barely got out of bed to eat or have a shower let alone going to lectures, blasting music into my ears in an attempt to blot out the voices in my head, the ones saying “you're useless, you’re worthless, you're never good enough, you're just not enough”.,Another thing with depression is, in my case at least, it was not on its own. Anxiety joined it, the constant nagging feeling in depression, it hit me out of the blue or seemingly so. I am a second year university student, achieving great grades, have a loving family and had a girlfriend, and so what went wrong you may ask? I don’t know why I am like this, if I knew I would change it in a blink of an eye. Looking back I can’t see anything that caused this episode. It just slowly crept up on me getting slowly worse and worse until a crash came when my girlfriend left me.,Your stomach. Petrified of something, but you don’t even know what you’re scared of.,People still find it difficult to understand - a few times I have tried to explain why I am like this, only to have people say “that’s nothing to be upset about, there are people so much worse off than you”. I respond to this statement simply, by saying that,: everyone has limits, some people are more predisposed genetically to struggling in times of hardship that others would just take with a pinch of salt. Depression is a very personal illness, each and every person that struggles with it struggles in their own way and that makes you feel alone. If you're reading this and struggling with any mental illness, you are not alone and please don’t keep things to yourself, try to talk about it. The only way we can break stigma is by communicating to those who don’t understand, because stigma is caused by misunderstanding. , "
,"2014 has been a rollercoaster of a year; I have experienced more pain and emotion than ever before. , A sudden loss of someone I hold dear caused me to re-examine my own life and begin to change it. I have always been very secretive when it came to my mental health, feeling ashamed and weak (views which people often express that just add to my own insecurities). In April I finally decided to not hide my illness any more, telling people openly that I suffer from a mental health illness was both terrifying and liberating. The reaction from those I love and people I didn’t know have changed my life drastically.,Writing , for Time to Change scared me, I was apprehensive due to previous experiences however writing enabled me to say things I have never said before and acted as a release for emotions I was just coming to terms with. Seeing the blog on the website took away a lot of my pain and shame, my family and friends' support made me realise that I didn’t have to hide anymore.,I won’t pretend that everyone understood and supported me; I did lose a number of friends. However seeing the number of people I didn’t know saying they understood and supporting me made me feel at ease. One of my best friends Nicola decided to do a charity run for a mental health: this spurred me on to also run for a mental health support charity. Running was a challenge, but doing it for a cause that meant something to me gave me a reason to train and keep going it gave me an outlet when I was struggling and took my mind of the grief I felt. When I felt angry or low I would run and it would help me sort my thoughts out.,The encouragement and support we received for the run was astounding, people began opening up about their own difficulties and struggles with mental health. We completed the 5K run in 35 minutes and raised £995.50, I enjoyed every minute of the run and in turn seeing the amount we raised helped me drastically with my mood.,The last 5 years I have relapsed repeatedly, suffering from rapid cycling Bipolar causes me to swing from mania to depression many times during the year. A recent diagnosis of Borderline Personality Disorder helped me accept a lot of my flaws. Throughout my whole life I have been in trouble for my anger, impulsivity and intense relationships I have always put this down to me. Discovering there was a reason for my troubles both terrified and helped me. My parents have been amazing, it hasn’t always been easy. There have been times where our relationship was strained and hope of a “normal” relationship seemed unrealistic. But they have never stopped caring and pushing me to be the best I can be. Without them I don’t know where or who I would be.,I feel hopeful for my future telling myself to believe that the 18 month intensive therapy programme I have begun will help me control my emotions so that I can find a job I love, hopefully helping children in schools with mental health conditions or raising awareness in schools.,This year I have found ways to cope and manage my emotions, taking up running and taking part in a charity run helped me with my grief and anger over the loss of my Auntie. Going with my dad to the allotment helped me relax and feel like I was helping and contributing to something. My fiancé has been my rock listening and supporting me in any way he can. My two closest friends Nicola and Billie have been my best friends for over a decade, they help me more than I can explain. When I cancel on going out as I can’t face people, they turn up with food and chat with me for hours. Thank you.,Discovering ways to cope with my emotions and removing negative energy from my life has made my recovery easier, it will take a long time but my loved ones are getting me there."
," ,Until now I have been ashamed of and never fully embraced my illness. , There has always been a stigma attached to mental health issues and I would only ever share my fears with friends and family. My anxiety and depression are a direct result of horrific bullying. Something so traumatic and terrifying that it almost killed me. As a teenager it was hard to imagine a life without anxiety, fear of taunting or physical abuse. I certainly didn't expect it to carry on in to adulthood. It is something that has literally coloured everything that I have ever done since, but it has also enabled me to see things very differently and put all of those feelings in to my writing.,The most part of my high school years was a living hell because of who I wanted to be - me! I've never wanted to hurt anyone and naively couldn't understand why someone would want to hurt me simply for the life I was trying to lead.,At 13 years I was caught innocently kissing a girl. I hadn't even heard of the word lesbian. From then on my life was a nightmare.,Name calling - it hurt. Head flushed down the toilet - humiliating. Teeth knocked out - embarrassing. Skull fractured - I wanted to die.,Relentless. Every.Single.Day.,My parents were at their wit's end.,I can't specifically recall the first time I self harmed, but I remember that it gave me such an enormous sense of relief. I didn't notice the pain but used it to castigate myself for being the terrible deviant and person that everyone thought I was.,My first panic attack aged 14 years left me feeling sick. My heart started pounding and I felt dizzy. I couldn't breathe properly and felt an overwhelming sense of fear - but of what, I didn't know.,Leaving school was a huge relief and the bullying stopped, the depression lifted and I could breathe again. But somewhere I felt a shadow was constantly following me. I went on and lived the life everyone else wanted me to lead and spent night after night fighting my thoughts and chasing away my demons.,In my twenties it reared its ugly head again, a black mark striking through me when I felt as though I had failed myself or others. The scars on my arm a permanent reminder of the past, present and future. I wanted out.,Hospitalised for eight months I nearly lost everything - my boys, my family and myself. I couldn't cope with every day tasks, couldn't breathe through the panic attacks. The love and support of my family pulled me through the darkest of days and twelve years later here I am.,So why now? Why open up to the world?,Maybe I hope, possibly in vain ,that the bullies will see the consequence of their actions and just maybe it will stop it happening to one other person? My illness isn't visible. I still have that cloud which shadows me, threatening to drown me in a sea of self-doubt at any time. However, I realise bullies will never change their ways, but rather it is how I cope with their actions that will be the difference.,'Sticks and stones can break my bones', so the old rhyme goes, 'but names can never hurt me'. As I have discovered to my detriment this week , and the last five months, if that was ever true it was in the innocent times. The years before the trolls crawled out of the internet sewers where they lurk and from which they spew their filth.,Now we know only too well that words do wound, even fatally - I was lucky and have found the help that I need.,I can truthfully say that it feels like there is light at the end of the tunnel. I have the most wonderful girlfriend who is supportive, kind compassionate and understanding. My family does not have an issue with my sexuality or illness and loves me unconditionally.,I hope, by speaking out from the heart, and using my voice, I can offer words that may be of use and serve as a platform for others to learn from.,Mental illness does not make me weak or define who I am, but rather empower me to live life to the full."
,"Mental health is a hot topic at the moment. The sad loss of Robin Williams gave everyone a forum to give their opinion on mental health; the thing that has astounded me after that tragic event is that there continues to be a huge ignorance around mental health, why?,I have suffered from , and severe anxiety throughout the majority of my adult life. The funny thing is I didn’t know it. I didn’t just wake up one morning and think “oh dear, I am depressed today”, it took years before I realised that I needed help as “something” was wrong. I am young, reasonably successful and very confident, to the outside world at least. I have amazing friends, a loving partner who is also my best friend and a close knit family – what the hell did I have to feel depressed about? “Get a grip”, “Have a word with yourself”, “Snap out of it”, “What is WRONG with you”!! The trouble is, when you do not know what is wrong or just how much your behaviour has changed, where do you start, how do you seek help?!,I began to realise something was wrong when I wanted to sleep, sleep a lot. I was subdued in social situations and felt I had no control over day to day life. I was snappy, emotional and often downright horrible to those I love. I had no patience and no matter what my nearest and dearest did, it just wasn’t good enough, and in fact they just irritated me!,My , really kicked in and most days I couldn’t get on the tube to work without my , and my partner. He would patiently stand talking to me, playing with my hair, distracting me and encouraging me to breathe through the panic attack that had me feeling I was having a heart attack. The pain in the chest, numbness in the arms, the inability to catch your breath, the fear…the unexplainable fear.,Eventually after long discussions with my partner “something has to change”, I went to the doctors. What to say?! “There is something wrong with me, but I can’t tell you what it is because I don’t know”. I was lucky to have a brilliant GP who’s careful questioning and understanding manner made me feel comfortable enough to open up. Did I think about taking my own life? – Sure, Was I self-medicating with drugs or alcohol – no, not self-medicating, just living the life of a young woman in a big city, surely everyone drinks an excessive amount, no? At the end of the consultation she told me I needed help, what form did I want it in? A shrink, I don’t think so! Group counselling, definitely not!,I was prescribed medication in increasing doses. I was given advice on positives to implement in my life and encouraged to join CBT (Cognitive Behavioural Therapy). I went and spoke with my GP every two weeks, opened up to my friends and family and made a conscious decision to change my behaviours – this wasn’t easy but each and every time I spoke to someone, I felt a little better, a little prouder. The one thing I realised? I was ill, this wasn’t something I could “Snap out of” nor could I just “Get a grip”. My mind was sick and I needed to help it to heal.,Of course it didn’t just happen overnight but slowly and surely over 18 months my life came back, I vividly remember sitting at my desk at work and a feeling came over me, I couldn’t put my finger on what it was – then it hit me, contentment. It was a long time ago that I last felt that.,With the support of my amazing partner, network of friends & family I am now feeling much better, exercising regularly and enjoying a moderate lifestyle. They will never truly understand what happened to me and where I went too, I am not sure I will either. But with their love and support I am back and I am ready to start the happy part.,Mental illness is unique to every single person that suffers from it and there is no easy cure, however, we all have mental health and sometimes, like our physical health, it can become unwell."
,"“So, two A’s for English I see. Well, I hardly think you deserve them given your lack of attendance to my class.” That is what my English teacher said to me on GSCE results day. It all seems so long ago now but I will never forget how my teacher decided to shame me rather than praise me for my success.,School is a tough time for anyone even without throwing a little bit of ‘mental health’ into the mix. The time at secondary school was when my darkest, scariest and most difficult issues began to raise their ugly head and take control over my life. On antidepressants by age 13, and antipsychotics by age 15, I felt I was in a living nightmare.,I wouldn’t like to think how much time I missed from school as a whole; a day here and there, a handful of lessons throughout the day, maybe even a whole week at a time. I really loved to learn, I genuinely did; so why wasn’t I attending? Well, even when my depression wasn’t cementing me to my bedroom floor and I had the energy to go to school, I hardly felt welcomed. I did have a very small circle of friends that I let into my deepest secrets of depression, anxiety and psychosis, but even their friendship wasn’t enough to anchor me and keep me in school. It wasn’t long before people were noticing the marks on my arms, fellow students labelled me “freak” and most commonly “attention seeker”, whilst teachers mainly averted their eyes, almost embarrassed to say anything. Why would I want to go to a place where I felt punished for feeling something that was in fact incredibly real?,I suppose now, as an adult, I can forgive the students that taunted me, called me names and found joy in my misery; they were young, easily influenced teens, probably going through their own problems. But I don’t think I can forgive my school. They failed me. My school was fully aware that I was under psychiatric care, as my psychotherapists liaised with them regularly. But my school did nothing. No support.,No care. My teachers were all aware, but they just seemed to ignore me. Now, don’t get me wrong, I wasn’t after any kind of preferential treatment; but schools have a duty of care to safeguard their students, and while I was quickly spiralling out of control, they did nothing to stop that.,For example, even though I had, very uncomfortably, told my male PE teacher that I did not want to do PE due to the sports kit exposing my scars, I was forced to do it. So I began to stop attending that lesson. Lessons where teachers seemed to treat me as ‘just another moody teenager’ also became neglected lessons. Even English, a subject I truly adored, became poorly attended.,I missed out on big chunks of my education because of a lack of understanding about mental health. My fellow students did not understand, to them I was an ‘emo’, a ‘freak’, a ‘weirdo’ who cut herself for attention and hated life; to my teachers I seemed to be a pink elephant in the room, awkward and not to be discussed, I was obviously going through some stuff but I was just a teen, how bad could it really be?,I managed to scrape through my school years, get my GCSEs and make it to college where FINALLY the teachers actually listened to me, which is all I ever wanted from anyone. It saddens me to think that back then, when I did feel I could attend, on the good days, I would then be in school only to be shunned and feel guilty for turning up in the first place.,So where am I now? Well, I’m an English Teacher, defying the odds and breaking free of the stigma my young education placed on me. The time to end mental health stigma is now; we need to keep people in schools and colleges, by ensuring that mental health issues are understood and discussed, not hidden away. My story is one of many, but I got lucky, whilst others might not have such luck."
,"When I first joined Time to Change, I had absolutely no idea just how much it would change my life; I thought I was just volunteering my time, but it turned out to be so much more than that.,From the age of 13, clinical depression plagued my life and in a time where being different didn’t give you instant fame as it does today, I learnt very quickly to keep it to myself. I watched as people I knew were branded ‘nutters’ and ‘freaks’ all because they were unwell, something they couldn’t control…something I knew about all too well. But I couldn’t say anything, to anyone…and I didn’t; for 10 years I kept it to myself.,But it wasn’t until I attended a Time to Change event in 2011 that I realised I wasn’t alone in my struggles – I was asked to write a blog about my experience at the event, and I also signed up to volunteer during the Summer Roadshows. Then I was being asked to contribute to newspaper articles, video shoots, be on the leaflet, give talks with celebrities, speak at private functions…it may sound overwhelming and it was, but it was also empowering because I’d never felt more alive. I had really missed helping people, no matter how small that help may be and becoming a Champion helped me to do that.,The great thing about being a Champion is that there’s no pressure to do lots of things which means you can do as much or as little as you want; my role initially was a very active one in the beginning as that’s how I wanted it to be. My goal was to help as many people as I could, and I’ve done all kinds of things from training new volunteers to being in a Channel 4 documentary with Ruby Wax. Regardless of what you want to do with Time to Change, whether it’s writing a blog, being in an advert, or attending a workshops which will provide you with all the training and tools you’ll need to do speak out about mental health.,Now I could tell you the figures which prove that attitudes are improving, and if you want to see them you can find them on the Time to Change website; but I would rather tell you about actual stories, about real people…experiences I’ve had.,At one event, a group of youths told me about how they’d always been mean to a guy in their class. One of them actually admitted to them that he had a mental health problem and they promised to do better. They went on to create a Mental Health Awareness club at their college. At another event a young man thanked me for talking to him and later wrote to me to say that he’d had the courage to tell the other residents he lived with. I later went to his accomodation to deliver a session on mental health and it was a huge success. It’s not just the public it helps either, many of my friends who I’ve met volunteering are running charities, organising their own events and much more. As for me…well, when I joined Time to Change I was depressed, unemployed and very much alone. Now, in addition to all the amazing experiences I’ve had with Time to Change and the awesome friends I’ve met along the way, I’m happy, working, married and I’ve just passed my first year at university.,I guess what I’m trying to say is that if really want to help, then maybe you should think about volunteering – not just because you’re standing up against discrimination or because you’re really passionate about mental health, but because it could possibly be one of the best things you ever do for yourself. Maybe if you give people a chance to discover how awesome you are, you’ll probably discover it too."
,"Hello I’m mad, mental, a looney tune, a nut-job, doolally, bonkers, a fruit loop or crackers – pick any. ,I personally like to call it wonky brain syndrome. And I can call it what I want to as it’s my brain. It's not politically correct but I’m not offended by words. I find these words actually more of a term of endearment to myself.,Living with any mental illness is tough. It’s shrouded in stigma and smeared with negativity so most people keep it hidden away scared of what others will think. That sucks. We shouldn’t be worried about what other people think. Be proud of who you are, mental bits included. I was always told not to show emotions or feelings or talk about mental health ‘issues’ as this shows you to be a weak person. I actually think to be able to do this is a sign of strength, not weakness. Yes I have a wonky brain, and if anyone has a problem with that it’s their problem not mine.,Everyone’s mental quirks are unique to them. We’re all different even though people try to put us into neat boxes. Do you suffer from depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety or obsessive compulsive disorder? Well actually I’m quite greedy and have a tiny little bit of everything. A mental health buffet.,? What have I got to be depressed about? Nothing – that’s not how depression works. I go to work, study for a degree and look after myself and my daughter. How can I do that if I’m depressed? Depressed people suffer and function in various ways. For me I paint on my functional face and act the part – fake it until you make it. Some days I make it and some days I don’t. This can be quite draining and sometimes requires a down day under a duvet watching Murder She Wrote to reboot myself.,I’m not suicidal but most days it wouldn’t bother me if I died. This is very difficult to explain if you are not in my head. This is how detached I am to myself. It bothers me that my loved ones would be upset though and that is why I’m not suicidal. But hey, the plus side is that if you’re ever in a hostage situation with me and they start shooting I will take a bullet for you as I value your life more than mine. Win.,I have many anxieties due mainly to my over thinking and distorted cognitive processing in my brain. My silly brain likes to play games with me and distort information like a melting kaleidoscope. I cry when I go down the escalator at Waterloo underground station as my brain tells me I’m going to fall and plunge to my death – I know logically this isn’t going to happen but my brain overrules logic on occasions. Many occasions. If someone tells me I’m stupid, ugly or useless, my brain confirms this as truth and then adds more insults. My brain throws selective OCD out at me; my DVDs have to be in chronological order yet I can leave my washing up undone for a day. Or two. Basically my brain is an idiot.,I am learning to live with this idiotic brain though and have many coping mechanisms. Being open about my mental health was the first big step but one I would recommend taking.,Tell someone. I don’t mean just go up to a random member of the public and tell them ‘Hey I’m mental’, although they would probably panic and agree with you pretty quickly, but talk to a friend or family member or anyone you feel comfortable with. Talk to a doctor if you think you might need more specialist help. Talking about mental health is a huge step. It can feel very daunting but once you’ve told people you have mental health issues it can feel incredibly liberating. The more people talk about mental health the less of a taboo it becomes. BT got it spot on with their advertising catchphrase ‘It’s good to talk’ – oh, they weren’t meaning mental health?,Accepting that I have a wonky brain and embracing it is the way forward. Fighting my wonky brain and trying to pretend it is all neat and tidy is unproductive. Instead I will be working with my brain to be the amazing person that I know is hiding inside and I know that because we are all amazing in our own wonky ways."
,"My battle with mental illness began sixteen years ago when I was a working mother and ,journalist. I was married with two children, ambitious, and loved my career. I was blessed in many ways, with a nice house and a supportive husband. It took three days for depression to incapacitate me. I went from being fully functioning to lying in a foetal curl on the floor.,I was amazed. I had thought depression was a case of lying around feeling vaguely despondent, and had absolutely no idea it could be so physically painful. I admit to being duped by stigma at the time – I didn’t want to tell people I was ‘depressed’, I wanted to tell them I had some other illness which seemed to me more legitimate and less ephemeral. I also felt guilty – depression was for people who had difficult or troubled lives, whereas I counted myself incredibly lucky, as well as very happy. No-one would believe I was depressed, or eligible for depression. ,Now I realize that your brain can go wrong, like any other organ in your body, but we have relatively little understanding of how or why. My doctor explained my symptoms as best he could. As I was suffering from acute anxiety and panic, my adrenaline levels were so high that they were stopping me sleeping. My systems’s priorities had switched from long-term to short-term survival were on a permanent emergency response. I had mobilised fuel reserves I didn’t need and I was taking in surplus oxygen to burn it. My heart had been pounding non-stop as my blood pressure and breathing increased. My appetite had disappeared as my body had shut down energy-consuming digestive processes. My pupils had dilated to let in more light and my reaction time had speeded up, all in readiness for attack.,All these physical responses should normally be short-lived. But in my state of heightened arousal they were maintained, exhaustingly.,Doctors now agree that the physical pain of a major depressive episode can be worse than physical illness. One doctor was quoted as saying in a classic book on depression that if he had to choose between suffering from renal colic, a heart attack and an episode of severe depression, he ‘would prefer to avoid the pain of depression.’,Depression is an illness, like cancer or diabetes, with attendant physical symptoms. This has helped me hugely in being open about my illness: I wouldn’t be ashamed or blame myself if some rogue cancer cells had invaded my body or if my insulin levels weren’t balanced. Nor did I need to apologise for suffering from depression.,Poetry has also helped me feel less ashamed of being unwell. Thousands of others through the ages have suffered and written about their own melancholy or depression. I am not alone. Darker poetry by Anne Sexton has helped me better understand the nature of my depression, where the healing images displayed in the work of Gerard Manley Hopkins and George Herbert have contributed to my recovery.,Currently, in the words of Herbert, my ‘shrivelled heart’ has ‘recovered greenness.’ I have tamed my black dog, though sometimes it still barks, and I have written a book about my struggles. If asked, I no longer say it is about the consoling power of poetry but rather a battle against a devastating illness. It was time for me to change. If what I’ve done helps one other sufferer to also open up, it will have been worth it., Black Rainbow: how words healed me – my journey through depression, "
,"Where to begin? I started to notice my mood changing and feeling more down during my final year of university in 2011-12. , There were so many factors that caused it - especially the pressure of doing my dissertation and looking for a job even before graduating. I also have a learning disability in the form of Dyslexia so things were much harder than they seemed at the time. There may have been other things too that may have triggered it over the years but this was a time that I was starting to notice something wasn’t right.,Doing student radio helped relieve some pressure and kept me from quitting my degree because it was so much fun to do and kept me focused. Despite that I still went for brief counselling session; it wasn’t much help because they advised me to see my GP and at that time I didn't feeling comfortable going.,Time passed by and I graduated in June 2012 but the pressure to find a job had increased and the number of rejections were affecting me a lot. I was lucky to work for a couple of weeks at the London 2012 Olympic Games and also go on holiday to India and Florida. But I started to notice that my control over my , (OCD) wasn't great; things were increasingly unmanageable.,During the rest of 2012 I was feeling more down: having arguments with my parents, not wanting to wake up and look for jobs, and also just shutting myself in my room for hours at a time. In addition to all of that I wasn’t working at my part-time job because of a training issue. I wasn’t getting much out of it and felt like I wasn't getting a lot of help in looking for jobs and supporting myself. I did have some positive experiences during this time, however. I started doing Hospital radio and this was one of two days I actually went out. Saturdays included going to a religious Hindu function where I saw my friends and close family.,Come early 2013 I had managed to get a different part-time job in London. It was going well but my anxiety started to increase and my OCD was getting worse by the day. Then the days were increased and I was given more responsibility.,During my holiday to India and Malaysia my OCD, panic attacks, anxiety and health were badly affected. I caused hell to everyone close to me on the trip and hardly went out of my room apart from the occasional trip. I tried to relax and only managed a couple of days and that was only in Langkawi, Malaysia.,Once back in London, my condition was getting even worse and my health wasn’t improving. I was having more panic attacks and I had to take some days off work. They were understanding and also trying to help. Unfortunately I had to eventually leave my both of my jobs due to my health.,Come around the 13, October 2013 the pressure was getting to me and I wanted to talk to someone before it was too late. I managed to tell my friends at radio on that evening after finding it stressful doing my own show and request show. Then it happened: I had a breakdown and tried to run away. The next day I was diagnosed me with depression and I was told to rest.,Since then I have tried to run away twice more. I am now receiving support, receiving counselling, on anti-depressants and my close friends and family have been trying their best to help me.,I have also opened up over the past few months about what I have been going through to people I meet;the response has been overwhelming to say at least but mainly positive. I know coming from an Asian background most people my age suffer in silence, but it doesn’t have to be that way. I wish it was more talked about and not so hushed up like it’s something bad.,I'm still going to continue my blogging, radio, filming and photography for all of my life. Even if one thing doesn't become a career at least I have something to fall back on. My support network is up and running and I am also enjoying the photography workshop at Wiseworks in Wealdstone, London.,To be honest, I am still struggling and fighting every day. It's a long road and journey to recovery and I am at times stressed, down and very scared about my future. Yes, I have improved a lot since my breakdown almost eight months ago, but I am still fighting myself."
,"For me feeling depressed is many things; extreme low mood, insomnia. It strips away my ability to function normally, takes away my ability to concentrate and steals all the pleasure from my life. On bad days my depression takes away any feeling at all, leaving simply numbness in its place.Depression is classified as a mental illness but my depression also manifests itself physically, through loss of appetite, extreme tiredness, headaches, nausea and pain. I have struggled with depression and anxiety for the past six years. I take medication every day, see a psychologist once a week and a psychiatrist once every three months.,However many of the people around me are unaware of my struggle with mental illness. After battling with my depression for years and being unable to keep it at bay for more than a few months at a time it overwhelmed me this time last year. I have spent the past year recovering, after being forced to defer my postgraduate studies. The past year has been difficult, but it is the first time that I have allowed myself time off to try and understand my depression and anxiety and how to manage it better.,I have always found it extremely difficult to be open about my struggle with my mental health. Some of my friends know that I have been ‘unwell’ over the past year, although they do not know why. Only a few people know that I have depression and fewer still know the extent to which I have struggled with it. It is not something I speak about openly. I see my depression as a sign of weakness and make every effort to hide it. I fear that people will pity me. I worry that they will treat me differently or it will change the way they think of me. I worry that people will think I am being self indulgent, or pathetic. In short, I feel ashamed.,However the way in which I judge my own mental health is the complete opposite of the way I think of mental illness in general. Whilst at university I volunteered for Durham University Nightline, a confidential listening service open throughout the night. I took part in training weekends, teaching volunteers about mental health. My mother is a clinical psychologist and my friends and family have had their own struggles with mental illness. I strongly believe that the continuing stigma and shame surrounding mental illness has no place in our 21st Century society. I am compassionate towards my family and friends, I would never judge them, I do not see other people’s mental illness as a sign of weakness or a reason for shame. However I am not able to show this same compassion to myself.,I am currently pursuing a career in Law and have secured funding for the next stage of my training. However Law is an extremely competitive field, with too many people vying for too few training contracts and pupillages. I am aware, also, that being a lawyer is a difficult and, at times, very stressful job. I worry that if I am open about my mental health issues I could face discrimination. That employers will see me as too much of a risk and that ultimately my depression could cost me the career I’ve worked so hard for and always wanted. I fear that in a field saturated with highly qualified people my depression will be the reason someone else is chosen above me. I worry too that my counterparts will look down on me, and will consider me less able than themselves.,I have spent the past year trying to find a way to stop being ashamed of my depression. I have been undergoing CBT and have learnt that I need to open up and be more honest, to ask for help instead of suffering in silence. To tell people how I am feeling, to not be ashamed and not to see my illness as a sign of weakness. Above all, I have learnt that I need to start being kinder to myself, treating myself how I treat others and trusting that the people around me will react in the way I would if the roles were reversed.,It has taken me a long time, but I am beginning to see that having depression has strengthened rather than weakened me. Winston Churchill, who himself suffered from severe depression, once said ‘if you find yourself in hell, keep going’. I still have good days and bad days but despite having to take a slight diversion from the path I originally intended I have kept going. I know that being able to talk more openly about my mental illness will not cure it, but I hope that being more open will help me to start managing my depression more effectively, to stop being ashamed and to draw on the help and support of those around me., "
,"I was 14 when I first noticed that I was depressed: it crept in without me realising until it got much worse. By the time I was 15, and with the pressure mounting up in my final year of GCSEs, I became much more unstable. I began to self-harm around October that year, something I am still overcoming today. I remember knowing that what I was doing to my body wasn't something I wanted to be doing, but I felt I couldn't stop hurting myself. I also knew that I needed to reach out to someone, but I didn't know where to go first. I worried about how my parents would react to finding out that I was depressed. I thought they might be angry or upset, but most of all, I was scared that they would be disappointed in me. I didn't feel I could reach out to my school because I didn’t think they could offer any support.,The first person I talked to about my mental health problems was my best friend. She’d had an eating disorder in the past and we had always told each other everything so I knew she would understand. Slowly, I began to reach out to other friends, who I had thought wouldn't be able to empathise with me; however, everyone I spoke to was extremely supportive and kind. My best friend urged me to seek professional help after talking to my parents, but she also understood that I felt I couldn't do that. Instead, with her advice and support, I began to see my school listener once a week, to try and talk about the feelings I was experiencing.,After six sessions, and just before the Easter holidays with the intense revision for my GCSEs starting, she became increasingly worried about me: I expressed the suicidal thoughts and ideations that I had been experiencing since as early as November the same academic year. As a result, I had a meeting with my school pastoral care team, made up of the deputy headmaster, and designated person for safeguarding, who then referred me to The Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS).,I was extremely worried about my school being involved, especially because I knew my parents would be informed about my situation. I also felt I might be judged at school for having mental health problems. I go to a private boarding school, and although a day student, it is sometimes assumed that just because I am lucky enough to attend the school I go to, that I am happy one hundred percent of the time. But I know from my own experience that mental health problems can happen to anyone no matter what background you’re from.,A lack of mental health support in schools is often publicised in the media, and it is definitely a prominent issue that needs to be addressed; however, the help I received was exceptional. My school were able to tell my story to the psychiatrist from a different perspective to what my parents could say, which was very helpful for the support team to better understand my experiences and help me start recovery.,When I started feeling increasingly suicidal in late May, I was offered free boarding from my school. This was particularly helpful given that CAMHS decided not to contact me for 6 weeks, despite the pastoral care team and my parents contacting them on numerous occasions. I firmly believe the support I received from school was the reason it was decided I did not need to be placed within a psychiatric ward temporarily, as this was seriously discussed in my early meetings at CAMHS. This allowed me to finish my GCSEs and achieve very good results despite my situation.,I am just about to start my final year of A Levels, and I can honestly say this is the happiest I’ve been for long time. I feel I have a constant safety net around me now; there is always someone to go to. Whether that be talking to a friend or parent, tutor, a member of the pastoral team, or my psychiatrist - I always have somewhere to go with my feelings, and now they don't get on top of me as much as they used to."
,"In March 2014, I applied for Cabin Crew with Emirates Airline., I was shortlisted from thousands of people, and battled my way to the final interview. It was the most exhausting week I had experienced in a very long time. After waiting 4 weeks, I received my ‘golden call’ and the recruiter told me that I’d been successful and would be starting with them on July 6. Instantly, I cried with happiness, shaking with excitement and called every number in my phone book, screaming my news! I finally managed to bag my dream job. I remember thinking to myself ‘it’s my time for happiness now, the years of hard work, tears and struggle were actually worth it after all.’,One week after receiving my ‘golden call’, I received extensive medical forms and I was shocked to learn that Emirates does not accept employees with previous ,; unless isolated. I was slightly concerned because I had experienced isolated bouts of depression in 2009 and 2012 due to personal circumstances and traumatic things happening in my life. It was the darkest time of my life. The depression led to anxiety issues and I closed myself off from the world. I was isolated and alone, and didn't talk to anyone about my depression – presumably due to the stigma surrounding it. I went to college/work every day and was always known as the ‘class clown’. I’ve always been very good at making people laugh; little did they know that I was suffering so badly inside. After medical support, I was cleared from the doctor and was ready to carry on with my life again, but this time, with a smile on my face.,As Emirates had asked for my records I supplied the required report, where my doctor states that I am mentally and physically fit, that I no longer require any medication and that these were isolated cases linked to trauma. One week before my joining date, I received an email from Emirates stating that I had not met their medical conditions and that the job offer had been withdrawn. The single paragraph left me shocked and heartbroken. I had my dream job taken away from me because I experienced depression. Mental health discrimination is illegal in England but Emirates seem to avoid this because they abide by UAE laws.,I initially set up a Facebook Page called Emirates Against Depression to warn other aspiring cabin crew against the unfair treatment by the airline – I wouldn’t wish anyone to go through what I had. I lost hundreds of pounds, turned down other job offers and lost so much more along the way. Within 24 hours, I was contacted by two newspapers; my story was online at The Independent and published the next day. My page was gaining more views, likes and comments from people who were outraged and shocked by my story from all around the world. Within 48 hours, my story reached the BBC and I appeared on television sharing my story, accompanied by ,.,As my story had gone global, I received an overwhelming response from people all over the world, sharing their personal stories of Emirates, other airlines and even other industries. I was completely overwhelmed how my story had touched so many, and that they were coming to me for advice and support. But I was more shocked at how many people face stigma and discrimination in the workplace because of their mental health problems.,I spent weeks replying to everyone, thanking them for their support but mainly offering advice. The main question I got asked was “What made you stand up to mental health discrimination?” Initially, it was anger, how could I be penalised for having depression? Secondly, I wanted to warn others to prevent this from happening to them. Of course, I was scared when my story was all over the internet and in the newspapers but I felt so passionate about my story – I had to help others who were going though similar experiences.,One in five adults experience depression, and that’s only the statistics for the people who speak out about it. Depression has made me a stronger, healthier person and provided me with the skills to empathise with all types of people and to deal with high-pressured situations. It’s changed my life, but for the better. Mental health discrimination is something I never dreamed of facing, but I am not afraid to talk about my depression. To other people who can identify with my story, don’t give up fighting - there is more support than you may think. In five days, my story went global – this shows to me how important this issue is. It also shows that we are not alone. We all know someone who has experienced a mental health problem - ourselves, friends, and family - so take a moment and ask yourself the question ‘Would you accept mental health discrimination directly?’ I don’t think you would. So, let’s continue to raise awareness, to fight against it and make it stop., "
,"Time to Change Champion Elaine talks about being diagnosed with severe , and her journey since."
,"For as long as I can remember I have felt like I have been burdened by living with mental health issues which almost ruined my life. ,The thing is, I didn’t let it, I won’t let it and as I’ve come to accept my issues - they are no longer a burden. ,My “problems” started at an early age; I was quiet, but with friends and family I was outgoing and full of life. I didn’t fit in too well at school because I was shy; that’s when the anxiety started. Attacks every morning and night.  Classmates would witness these and notice my absences - they used this as ammunition to bully me. I didn’t know what was happening. I just felt sick. That’s when the depression crept in.,Getting out of bed was a chore, I had no energy and wanted to be alone. I started to self harm as a way of coping, a way of keeping calm. ,After 5 years of suffering in silence my scars were noticed. My mum took me straight to the doctors. With anxiety and depression I was quiet, shy and withdrawn. I didn’t like speaking. So when my doctor started asking me questions I couldn’t answer. That’s when I first really felt judged for having these issues. My doctor, of all people, turned to me and said “Chrissie you are a very ignorant young girl."" Everything started spinning, I felt like everything was all my fault. I felt like I shouldn’t feel the way I did and that I should just get over it. I felt like a failure and let down to be putting my family through what I had. I felt so much guilt that I let that eat me up even more. I felt ignorant, but I couldn’t physically speak. I was so scared and ashamed of what I felt - even more so after that visit to the doctors. ,After seeing another doctor I was given appointment for CBT (cognitive behavioural therapy) and a psychiatrist. By then I was scared to leave the house, I was having constant panic attacks, suicidal thoughts and using unhealthy coping mechanisms. I had lost my friends and spent my time in my room, I didn’t sleep and I barely ate. I thought my life was over and honestly I didn’t feel I had the energy to save myself. ,The morning of the appointment I lost control of my breathing, I felt sick and everything was spinning. I was crying, but mum wasn’t going to give up on me. She got me there. I headed straight for the bathroom and locked myself in.  A few moments later there was a knock on the door “Hi Chrissie, my name is Sarah”. That was the start of one of the most important relationships I was ever going to have. ,Sarah was my therapist.  She put me at ease and I was willing to give this a try. We spoke to the psychiatrist, he prescribed me antidepressants to give me a boost to get me to my sessions. I was a 16 year old girl relying on medication to get out of the house for one hour for a therapy session. I was ashamed.  Week after week my mum would drag me out of bed and drive me to sessions while I would cry and shake in the back seat. ,After a few months I turned up at my session, calm, no tears and breathing normally. I still felt sick but I had no attack, Sarah praised me, my mum praised me and then I smiled. A smile, which for the first time in years I really meant. Before I knew it I was going out and seeing friends! Sarah and my mum stood by me the whole way through until we all thought I had reached the point where I didn’t need Sarah anymore. Now I would go as far as to say Sarah saved my life, she gave me hope and she showed me how to live. ,I had a good life, amazing family and good friends before this. What was my problem? ,I know now there was no problem. We never found a definite reason for how I was feeling - I’ve come to accept now that this is a part of me, always has been and always will be. I still have bad days, bad weeks - sometimes bad months. Each time I come back stronger. People think that mental illness is something to be ashamed of, or people need to be treated differently. I’m not ashamed.  I still suffer from depression and anxiety, but I feel that it has made me a stronger, more independent person. It is hard, but this is who I am."
,"For as long as I remember I have been different, but maybe back then I didn't realise how much of an effect it would have on me as I got older. ,I'd say the realisation came in middle school; everyone seemed so care free, so happy and confident, but behind my fake smile and popular group of friends I was battling mentally. I was constantly worrying what people thought of me, why I didn't think I fitted in, that I was a outsider and nothing I said was interesting, like I wasn't good enough for anything or anyone. This carried on through my school years; I just felt like I was getting dragged through life, like it was a blur. I couldn't stop asking myself, why me?,At 17, things started to get better; I started to see a opening for me, a future where I'd be happy. Days were getting easier and more enjoyable. Then life's cruel ways shot me back down. My mum and dad had just returned from a lovely holiday when my dad was taken ill from an infection in his body from a bite he received while he was away, a week later rushed into hospital. Little did I know he wouldn't be coming out. Two weeks later, at 45, my dad passed away suddenly, due to organ failure. Devastated. Why? Such a good man. Not long after my grandfather took ill also passed away, seven months later my uncle followed with an heart attack. Yet again that same question, why me?,After this I went into deep ,, left college, left work. Drained of any hope I had for happiness, my poor family torn apart in the worst possible way. Family were battling their own grief how could I trouble them with mine? So I bottled it all up and pushed it to the back of my mind. I needed to be strong, not be weak. Oh how wrong I was. Advice to anyone suffering: bottling all of those feelings up will not help - the bottle will fill one day, and it WILL need to spill. Speak up.,At 19, after two years of just trying to cope with life, I met my partner, he swept me off my feet, life had a meaning. Was my luck turning a corner? Still battling with anxiety and depression, good days and bad days. He knew I worried a little more than the average person, but he didn't know how bad this was. How could he? I didn't tell him what I was feeling. What if I lost him?,After a while my partner could read me like a book, he knew I was suffering, him and my Mum confronted me. I though for sure he would leave me, who wants to be with someone with mental health issues I thought?,Sitting here typing this, I realise I should have confided in someone a lot sooner, and urge anyone suffering in silence to do so - no one deserves to suffer alone. We don't choose to be mentally ill, who would choose that? We are human just like everyone else, we have dreams and ambitions like everyone else, just our road getting to them has more obstacles to conquer.,Two years on at 21 I still have the odd bad day, but that's it - not everyday is a bad one now! My partner and Mum have been my rocks. Therapy has done so much for me. I can see that it's not dark at the end of the tunnel. We are all in this together. Talking about it, raising awareness - we can beat this. I know I am!"
,"I'm Vicky, I'm 28, I have a gorgeous seven month old son, a loving partner, a fluffy pet cat, a good job, a nice house, and post natal depression. , To everyone looking in, it probably looks like I'm ecstatically happy. Bar my GP, my partner, and my most understanding friends, I haven't told anyone. Not my friends, not my family, not my colleagues, no one.,I'm terrified to talk about it, but at the same time, not talking about it is all consuming. It seems to me, by way of poorly written parenting blogs, sensational gossip magazines, and misguided comments on social media sites, that people think post natal depression is about the bond someone has with their baby and their ability to ""parent"", or it's just ""baby blues"" and the inability to cope with a huge life change. But it's not like that.,My baby is my world, my motivation, my raison d'être. Sometimes I look at him and just cry and how perfect he is. But sometimes, I become convinced that I'm a terrible mother, I'm anxious that my baby doesn't like me, I can't sleep at night, I feel detached from the world, and like I'm failing him. And at my absolute worst, I would think about harming my baby, and then about taking my own life.,How am I meant to talk to people about that? How do you casually bring up something that heinous in conversation with friends, who have come to visit to gush at how chubby his little cheeks are, how happy you must be, he's an angel, you should be so proud. I couldn't even tell the understanding level headed GP at my post-birth check up without bawling my eyes out, I felt so ashamed and full of self-loathing, and full of fear that my son would somehow automatically be taken away from me, that I would be branded an ""unfit mother"".,After my initial diagnosis I told a couple of friends via email about my appointment and the things my doctor had said. I couldn't bring myself to tell them in person, or even over the phone. Saying words out loud would just make things more real, and it's taken me a long time to feel ready to talk about it. Both the friends I told are parents themselves, and although neither of them have had post-natal depression, I know they've been affected by depression and by other ""invisible illnesses"", and knew they would be supportive. I haven't been able to tell them about those darkest moments, and I'm not quite at the point where I can call them on a bad day, but knowing that there are people who know and who still love me, gives me some hope.,But on the flip side of this, there have also been times when I've skirted around the issue, tried to steer a conversation with someone towards the point where I can tell them, and then just as I'm about to close my eyes and utter the words ""I have PND, I'm taking tablets, it's been tough"" they say something that stops me in my tracks, and makes me steer away the conversation back to something less emotive and evocative. Without realising what I was trying to say, I've had friends tell me that post natal depression ""is just tiredness"", that those suffering ""just need to snap out of it"", ""need to realise how lucky they are"", and the absolute worst ""some people don't deserve to be parents"".,No one with post natal depression is suffering through choice. No one wants post natal depression. And even just knowing that some people don't think I ""deserve"" to have endured everything I have in order to have had a child, makes everything even harder.,I would love to be able to tell my all of my friends, explain to my family, but I don't know how to. I would love for someone to admire my son, tell me he's adorable, and then ask my how I'm honestly doing. But more importantly than that, I want people to realise that post natal depression isn't a weakness or a lack of facing up to responsibility, it's an illness, it's a terrifying, numbing, dark and twisted illness, experienced by normal people."""
,"With one in four people affected by mental health problems the law of averages mean that, with over 20,000 elected Councillors in England and Wales, some of them could be experiencing some form of mental illness. , I would put myself in that category: I'm both a local Councillor (and have been since 2012) and I have been for many years and currently am experiencing depression.,We have had MPs Kevan Jones, Charles Walker and John Woodcock speak out about their mental health problems in an effort to break the stigma around the subject, but very few local politicians have talked about the subject. Is this because of concerns around stigma and mental health? Is there a fear that constituents (or even opponents or colleagues) may somehow have a perception that this as a sign of weakness?,But Mental Illness is not a 'weakness' or some 'personality flaw'; it’s an illness like any other. Just because your arm is not in a sling, or your leg is not in plaster, it does not make it any less of an illness. Speaking up about my own depression was a major step for me and, in part, lead to me becoming a Councillor.,I had a series of personal tragedies that brought to the forefront feelings I'd struggled with for years. I went to my GP and started counseling sessions. Afterwards I felt the confidence to speak about my experience and help others that maybe going through the same thing.,I wrote , and had a great response from others who told me how my 'speaking up' had helped them. Many of them said how they had always thought I was this confident person with such a positive attitude and that I had inspired some to seek help themselves.,I was now in a mind-set and position where I found myself looking for an avenue to help others. I had been politically aware for many years and, after attending a local government association event about becoming a Councillor, this seemed like a great opportunity to serve my community.,Being a Councillor can be extremely stressful especially when juggling family commitments as well as working full time. I have a responsibly to my residents who elected me but also a responsibility to my family to be healthy and be there for them. I have had to learn that depression is part of who I am, but it is not all of who I am. I'm much more than that."
,"I love my , so much, they're one of the main reasons I'm still here fighting each day. ,But in the past, whenever I've managed to gather to nerve to discuss how I feel, they were never receptive. They just didn't seem to understand why I would struggle to motivate myself to apply for that job, to get some exercise, to go out with friends or to engage in some sort of extra-curricular activity to improve my CV. Things are getting a little better between us now, but they can still get frustrated with my apparent laziness and apathy. I have explained to them that I'm doing my best but I often can't summon the energy when things just seem so pointless and futile.,I can't completely blame them though, as strange as that sounds. They're very hardworking people, and my dad's family are pretty competitive. My cousins have all gone to prestigious ,, while I'm studying at a far more mediocre institution. They all excel academically, socially, and in sport, and my aunts, uncles and grandparents never let me forget it. Despite the fact they all went to private school and my brother and I went to a state school, I still feel pressured to compete with them. It's probably partially why I tend to feel so demotivated, but I always compare myself to those around me; I always have. It's a habit. So I think my parents, my extended family, and I all have this rather unhealthy mindset of competition and achievement which is why I don't entirely blame my parents for acting the way they do.,It's been a bit easier since I moved to university though. I can distance myself when I feel them pressuring me, and I can be my own person. In October I went to a university counsellor, whom after several sessions of talking to me, sent me to the doctor who prescribed me some anti-depressants and Cognitive Behavioural Therapy. Being away from home, I managed to keep it all to myself until the therapy sessions interfered with our family holiday over easter. It forced me to overcome my trepidation over how they'd react, but still I thought it best to break it to my mum rather than my dad, she's a lot more sensitive (as most mothers are I guess). She seemed to accept it, especially when I explained that I hadn't just rushed to the doctor hoping for a miracle cure, but had instead sought a second opinion when I was feeling low. Then she told my dad, who in turn, expressed his concern, especially that I'd started to take anti-depressants given the possible side-effects etc, which is a fair concern. He soon made his peace with the way I'd handled it though.,Now several weeks have passed and our relationship is no different to before, except the feeling of being liberated, and no longer having to hide how I feel from my family. I'm still struggling, but for the first time in my life I feel like I can handle it, and things seem to be on the way up. Soon I might even be...wait for it...happy!,I still feel a bit worried that my potential future , may discover that I have these problems and reject me as a result, despite modern society and laws against discrimination etc, but we have to make a stand. I work just as hard as anyone else and don't let this stuff get in the way, so it shouldn't be an issue."
,"I’d never realised the joy of reading until I was in my early twenties. This was because I was rarely at school due to bullying which led me to playing truant. I had very poor eyesight and this didn’t help until I started wearing my glasses in my early twenties when I became very interested in reading about history and politics. So as my thirst for knowledge increased I became an avid reader of books. In my early thirties, I enrolled in a course which enabled me to go to study for a degree in journalism. I graduated, but 2 years later I had a breakdown which led to me being an inpatient at a mental health unit for about 6 weeks. ,After being diagnosed with clinical depression with suicidal tendencies I was eventually discharged into a hostel which led to a very unstable and chaotic life for the next ten years. Meeting Polly changed all that., was an inspirational figure in my life at a time when I was going through a very difficult period. Prior to meeting her my life was a cycle of depression, drugs and alcohol abuse including suicide attempts, spells in psychiatric units, rehabs, prisons and hostels. However, that has since changed. No more am I having constant thoughts of suicide when life was full of despair and emotional anguish. ,Since that day when I walked into Polly’s , my life has changed. In fact I can still recall my first day at her session when she gave me a copy of Rudyard Kipling’s poem “If”. A poem that has had a very positive effect on my life! ,Many times have I used the poem at public engagements to illustrate the power of literature to overcome adversity, and I talk about Polly’s ‘Speaking Out’ project, a Time to Change funded campaign, that challenged mental health stigma through literature by using short stories and poems to raise awareness. When I first walked into that session never could I have imagined that one day there would be a time when I would be on Radio WM, performing at The Rep or The MAC in Birmingham.,I’m now managing my depression and dealing with the bullying I endured throughout my childhood and adult life and rather than abusing drugs I’m using literature to combat my depression. I want to say a big thank you to Polly and have written a poem for her which is being put into an anthology.,As I swam the choppy waters of my life ,My voice lost in adversity,Whilst swimming against the tide,Despite the wind and the taste of salt,Washing my mouth and wounds ,I kept afloat and came ashore,When drowning in a sea of despair,She gave me back my life,When all is said and done,She heard my voice,And helped me write again”, "
,"Being a 21 year old studying at ,, I feel it is now time to be honest about my illnesses and not be ashamed of them anymore. , Hiding them isn't going to help myself or anybody else, so I'm ready to talk.,Talking about mental health has always been an issue for me, mainly because the only things I've ever heard from people who have opened up have been negative. I strongly believe this is why it has taken me so long. I built up such a fear that I will be judged that I've kept even my closest friends and family in the dark.,Last year I was admitted to a mental health facility after I had hit my lowest with depression and anorexia. I was so afraid of what might happen to the people that found out that I didn't tell my family for days. My housemates only found out when the paramedics came to the door and I was led out and put in the back of an ambulance. Not only was I terrified but I'm pretty sure my housemates were too. Keeping them in the dark hadn't helped myself and, looking back, I think it would have been easier to be open with them about it initially. It took four days of minimal contact over the phone with my family to finally tell the truth about how bad things had gotten, and the shame I felt was unbearable.,I believe it is difficult to explain any aspect of mental health, especially to anybody who has never experienced it, but also refuses to believe in such illnesses. My main battle with stigma is the the fact that (most of the time) mental health problems are 'invisible'; I struggle when people tell me I look well, or I look happy, because they don't see what I see in my head every day. I remember my Dad coming to visit me for the first time in the unit and telling me that he didn't realise things were serious. How do you make someone realise and how do you go about it without terrifying them?,After being in the inpatient unit for a considerable time last year I had to sacrifice my studies at university, but returned to repeat the year in September. I find it amazing how differently I have been treated with the people around me not knowing my circumstances and, although I am physically in a much better place than I was, I struggle mentally knowing that some of the people I am around don't know about my illnesses. I feel guilty when I'm having a bad day, relapsing or just generally not in a good headspace and I will continue to wonder if I would be accepted if I opened up to them.,Of course I don't blame the stigma on anybody, but I am certainly not helping myself by keeping people in the dark. I hope this can help people understand that I, like other people experiencing mental health illness, am more than my diagnoses."
,"When I was around 13 I started experiencing generalised ,. My Dad had passed away a few years prior and alongside the anxiety I really struggled with depression. Symptoms of the anxiety included sickness, sweating and palpitations.,By age 16, my anxiety had started taking over my life, to the point that I found it difficult to socialise and leave the house.  Although friends knew about it, I didn’t ever talk about it as I thought it was something that just affected me.  Friends understood and showed compassion, but didn’t really know what to say.,When I started a new as a Sports Assistant for the department of Sport and Recreation at Portsmouth University.  My anxiety took hold again, so I decided it was about time to see the doctor and over the next few months I experimented with different therapies and took some time off.,By the age of 19, I managed to overcome most of the anxiety, but just couldn't shake the depression. I felt so proud and self-fulfilled in that area but the fact that I was left with the crippling depression was what really brought me down the most. ,I felt determined to fight these feelings and when I returned to work, I started a course of CBT and was allocated a community support worker.  Doing exercise and regularly going to the gym had a big impact on my life. ,I’m now 23 and I look back on younger years and can’t believe how things have changed.  At one point I couldn’t leave the house and now I talk publicly about my experiences and have a fantastic job.  I lead a full, happy life and have a great network of friends. ,I’m lucky to have a great friendship network and have three mates in particular that have really been there for me “through thick and thin”.  Like many of my friends, they have been there for me when I’ve been going through a tough time and have looked out for me over the years. They all still stay in touch as much as possible.,We'd often go to the gym together and train, go out to eat or just generally chill out at each other's houses watching films all day. It'd be something I always looked forward to, regardless of how low or perhaps balanced I felt within mood. I never ever took out the issues on other people, I realised that what I was going through wasn't anybody's fault, especially my friends'.,I always saw the time spent with friends as valuable and a nice positive escapism for a few hours, or for the day. Time like this was essential to recovery.  It’s surprising how understanding people can be if you confide in them. Mental health is like any other illness, everybody now knows somebody who's dealing with or has dealt with it, so it can easier to relate than you may first think."
,"I am a husband, a Daddy to my three beautiful young children, a Mental Health Nurse, ,  with a good circle of ,, and a person who is confident in who they are and confident about what they want out of life. I was a contributor on the Channel 4 mental health stigma and discrimination documentary “,”. The documentary featured a panel of business experts and viewers tried to identify which out of the eight contributors had lived with significant mental illness in the past. Some of the contributors had not. I was one of those contributors who said, at the time, that they had not ever experienced any form of mental illness.,So why would I be writing this blog on , and ,? Well, I said at the time of the documentary that I wanted break down the stigma surrounding mental health and raise awareness for those who had lost someone through suicide, like I had. But what I was terrified of admitting and coming forward to talk about at the time, was my very own battle with mental illness, and that I had also tried ending my own life.,From the age of eleven which is when I first started my “strange behaviour” (as I called it back then) to when I fell feet first into my very own black hole from the age of fourteen through to thirty. I had been living with bulimia and, by the time of my late teens had crept up on me, I was experiencing depression.,My reason for me talking about my mental illness now is simply because I now feel ready to encourage others, and to finally talk about the something that I have kept a secret from friends and work colleague since I tried to end my life and was admitted to a psychiatric hospital for five weeks in 1999.,The pain and suffering that I had to injure, as a young man growing up, still lives with me, my own family never knew of my pain, it was all my very own kept secret. Bulimia took over my life, and depression nearly ended it.,To talk about it then was something that I dare not do; things are changing but it is still hard for men in particular to talk so open about bulimia, depression, and suicide. These are still seen as taboo subjects, with huge stigma attached. Talking about eating disorders and depression in men needs to be accepted. And no longer a taboo subject. And for someone who was suffering from an eating disorder, particularly as a young man, the silence that surrounds mental health adds fuel to the silence you suffer with an eating disorder.,I want to help change the perception of men who suffer from mental illness and challenge their stigmatising and discriminatory attitudes towards mental illness.,By speaking out I hope I can encourage other men to seek professional help, and as a mental health nurse with lived experience of mental illness it will enable other health professionals to have the confidence to speak out. Mental health professionals are deemed to be the last people you would expect to have mental health problems, but in my experience this is wrong. We are human after all, we are no different to those who suffer in silence.,There are those who work in mental health right now, too afraid to come forward because of the stigma that’s surrounds a mental health worker with mental illness.,Now as a mental health nurse I see all ranges of mental illness and myself do not judge those who have a mental illness as I know first-hand just how difficult and self-destructing living with a mental illness can be.,I’m a stronger person now and by highlighting my past illness it will help me gain positive attributes rather than being treated on the basis of having suffered mental illness. Having had an eating disorder and depression I will now be able to respond to those people and educate them on how difficult it is to live with. I am sure some people will see a different side of me now; the people who matter to me will take me as they know me now.,I am still the same person as before but a lot happier inside as well as out. I believe I am wiser as I have learnt to cope with my bulimia and depression, and can safely say for the first time in my life I am now happy with myself. What will make me even happier and my work even more worthwhile is by people recognising that being diagnosed with a mental health condition is nothing to be ashamed of."
,"I'm Rog, the father of Paul. , Paul is an ordinary type of guy; he's maybe a little quiet, but he has a job, a car and, during the period I am going to be talking about, everything seemed wonderful. I wasn't giving things a second thought – I had my own job and my own worries.,One Thursday Paul came home from work early; he said he had clocked out and just come home!,""WHAT ARE YOU DOING, DO YOU WANT THE SACK?” I said.,After all, Paul is not a teenager - he's 26 - surely he should know better than this. Paul went to work the next day and stayed the shift. ""Oh good, I got through to him"", I thought.,The following week Paul clocked out early again on the last day of his shift pattern, so he now had four days off. When I asked what on earth was he up to, he said he was ,.,""DEPRESSED?!” I said.,I didn't have time to get depressed, especially at his age. At his age I had just become a father and had achieved a promotion. I thought: “It must be lovely to have the time to be depressed"".,Two weeks later, on a Friday morning, Paul got up and was talking quite strangely. By Friday night he was discussing all the evil he had done in his life. I was confused – I knew Paul as a really nice guy; it wasn't true that he had done evil things. I started to think: “Is there a secret life I don't know about?”.,The next day Paul was in deep distress; he believed every car was a police car and they were coming to lock him away for all the evil things he had done. Suddenly I had to challenge the opinions I had held for years – I had to grown up; my Paul was having problems with his mental health. But what do you do? Who do you talk to? I knew my local hospital A&E unit had a psychiatric unit, I'll start there. But how could MY son need a unit like that? A few hours later I was walking him into the local specialist Mental Health Hospital. Paul was a very poorly man. I'm his dad and, when I look back, the stigma started with me. Oh boy did I have a steep learning curve to climb., Paul slept and wept for the past two days in the mental health unit. The staff have been marvellous, feeding me information - but none of it has gone in. The only question I need answering is:- What did I do wrong to cause this? At the end of visiting time, Paul just stood there, all 6ft of him, with tears rolling down his cheeks, I gave him a hug and left. I was on the 20 minute drive home and it hit me – hard. I was thinking about me yet it was Paul who was ill. I'd hugged him, and he smiled, for the first time in weeks. Paul didn't need any medication from me, he just needed me! So come on Rog, be his Dad.,The next day at visiting time, I hugged him when I went in. Such a little natural action but it meant the earth to Paul. We sat and talked like two guys having a chat. That night travelling home I realised he doesn't need Rog the dad; he needs Rog his friend., Paul was now asking a few questions of his new friend and we even managed a little joke. Although still a poorly guy, Paul was showing a glimmer of being the person he was before., The Consultant said I could take Paul out for a couple of hours. He wanted to go to the restaurant I hate the most, but we went and we ate. Two guys having a meal together. By now I knew Paul's recovery was going to be long term and I had booked myself on a night class about Paul's psychotic episode. So the classes started and we went to the same restaurant for the next few days, and then the magic words: Paul can have a night at home., The friendship we built up in those early days has gone from strength to strength. I do believe this new bond has helped us both. And you know what? I've realised you don't need time on your hands to be depressed; it is like the flu - it can happen to anyone, at anytime, at any age.,If anyone were to ask my advice about how to deal with a person experiencing mental health problems, I would have to say a few things that I believe--but understand I am not an expert--are important.,And me now? Well we all know--if we care to observe--a lot of people with varying mental health issues. Sometimes saying ""Hello"" can give someone a boost. Listen to the person: their fears and demons are very real to them; sharing them with a friend can help. Do I feel guilty about my first, unenlightened response to Paul's illness? Yes, of course I do, but sincerely hope I have made it up to him and helped a few others like him on the way.,Paul's condition is under control now and he is happy - hopefully he will soon be marrying his fiancée! It can be a long, slow, hard road but worthwhile for a son, and good friend, like Paul."
,"Hey, how’s it going today?” said the young guy at the counter in Prêt a Manger, with wide eyes and a beaming smile. ,“I’m OK, thanks,” I said, smiling back. “A bit tired, but OK.” ,“OK? I was hoping you were ,,” he said, reminding me when he handed over my sandwich that tomorrow could be another awesome day.,As I stepped out onto the street, I hoped that I’d chosen what the Prêt guy had eaten for lunch. Not really. What actually dropped into my mind was a recent conversation with my counsellor about how it can be a challenge to stay unhappy for prolonged periods of time.,Let me explain. I’ve probably spent most of my time on earth trying to be an upbeat, positive sort, cheery in company and smiley with people who work in shops and restaurants. I’d say I do it pretty well and I like the fact I’m that way inclined. But there can be a flipside. I mean, what happens when you feel less happy than ,? It happens.,For me, strange things happen when I don’t – or can’t – allow myself to be how I really feel. Clearly, I’ve learned somewhere along the line that certain emotions are less permissible than others. So I can end up feeling guilty about being unhappy, angry with myself for feeling angry, awkward about being unsociable, or similar. It’s a weird double-whammy of feelings that end up nowhere useful.,I read a good quote once where repressed emotion was likened to ‘locking hungry dogs in the basement of your house’. ‘The hungrier the dogs get, the more energy it takes to control them’.,So our bodies and minds do amazing things in being able to control, but what happens when the less permissible emotions become unmanageable? I wonder if depression steps up here. If you can’t stand the barking, it's taken further underground, into lockdown where it isn’t heard at all.,Back to the session with my counsellor, I was trying to describe what I experienced on a walk with our dog earlier in the day. While she was running about our local marshes, sniffing clumps of grass and stuff (our dog, not my counsellor), I felt sad. Not about what was going on right then; not about anything in particular; but sad. It stuck with me. I stuck with it. We walked for a while with Molly the dog. And, though I am genuinely talking about sadness here, there was something comforting about spending time together. I might be tidying things up in my mind as I can only see all this in retrospect, but in the sadness I glimpsed something rare and skittish like the foxes Molly and I sometimes see while we’re out.,In the counselling session it was good to share this experience with someone who would – and could – hear what I was saying. Of course, that’s what a good counsellor can do. He or she can hear what you can’t anymore. And, by sharing, you start to trust these emotions aren’t that weird after all.,There’s another quote I like, even though I’m not sure I understand it. It goes… ‘Emotions are like conversations. Others must participate for us to feel happy, sad, angry or satisfied’.,By others participating then, perhaps we can get to a place where we rekindle connections with our more out-of-favour emotions (though this is clearly not easy). We put our own stigmas aside, unlock the door of the basement and pick up the connections again. So, to be , we don’t feel obliged to break into song. We can be ourselves, and we can allow others the same."
,"On my way home on the train with my Dad after having a massive panic attack at university in London, was when I first acknowledged to myself that I needed some help., Physically, the panic attack was the worst I’d ever had, and I ended up being carted off in an ambulance, alone in a big city. I was scared because I thought I was about to die. But what scared me even more, is that for a second, I had a thought, that if I had died, I really wouldn’t have cared. Even now, on the long but steady road to feeling better, I find it really hard to come to terms with the memory of that thought.,It really is hard to describe what it feels like to be depressed, I don’t think that I ever could. Or at least, I could never describe it in a way that would give significant resonance to how it really feels. As a creative person, finding ways to express how I feel comes naturally to me, but when it comes to expressing how depression and anxiety have affected me, it’s like I’m scared to even let it out, because then it would give life to the ‘thing’ that has been so dark and awful.,Things started to spiral whilst I was on holiday. Everything should have been perfect. I’d got into a top uni, we were staying in a beautiful place. But for me, nothing much seemed beautiful. I, had this terrible feeling that something very awful was going to happen. I knew then that it wasn’t logical, but that didn’t help to ease the intensity of. I cried hysterically and told my boyfriend that I knew I was going to fail, and that I was a disappointment to everybody. I was terrified to be alone with my thoughts.,I spent a lot of my time alone at uni, and things only got worse. I was convinced that I wasn’t good enough to be on my course and that I wasn’t like anybody else. It was like my mind was on overdrive, and it was a voice in my head was just saying over and over ‘you can’t do it’. I could literally hear myself saying it, and once I even said it out loud without realising. I really felt as if I was losing my mind, I felt so unexplainably out of control. I thought that If I couldn’t even control what I was thinking or saying, what was I capable of? I worried that because I thought I was ‘going crazy’, I wouldn’t know what I was doing and I would hurt myself. What if I just can’t stop myself from jumping in front of that train coming towards me? I didn’t want to do that, I just felt as if I had lost all control of myself. I felt as though my mind was so weak, that It wouldn’t be able to stop me. It’s a truly awful feeling to think that you have no control. I was in a very dark place.,For a long time, I refused to say that I was depressed. I was so ashamed. I thought that people would think I had no reason to be depressed or they would say I was 'mental', and that they wouldn’t want to be around me. Admitting it to myself was the hardest thing of all, because those negative and completely false assumptions had come from me. It felt like admitting I was crazy, and a failure, with no reason to be the way I was.,Now, I am in a much better place. I was given the support from loved ones to talk, and people listened. It is through talking, that I learnt about mental health problems like depression and my increased understanding made it far easier to accept it for myself. I do have ups and downs, but releasing myself from the stigma that I had has allowed me to see that I do not need to be ashamed. It’s very important that people are not ashamed and that they feel able to talk, to anybody that they want too. In my opinion, it is the affirmation that you are not alone that will be the best support you will ever receive."
,"This is how I got involved; It had been a conversation that my wife over heard in the teachers' staff room, in the college that she previously worked at. , A teacher had been discussing inviting someone in to talk about mental health with all years as part of PSHE. My wife volunteered me for the job knowing that I had been looking for this opportunity for ages, but even as a Time to Change Champion I had not done it. I was given a very general brief for the mental health discussion, so I planned to carry the message of ‘Time to Talk’ in to the school and using the ,.,The excitement of the planned week in school was immense to start with, but by the time I got to Sunday evening I was getting slightly anxious, packing and repacking all the materials, reading and checking my PowerPoint for most of that evening. The plan was to spend the lunchtime with an information point near the school reception, where the majority of students had to pass by, and then I had the main assemblies done by year, 15 minutes to get my point across. Talking to students during lunchtime had kept me distracted but then the bell went; I started the long anxious march towards to the assembly hall to face the most feared age group imaginable (year 9s in every school are notorious).,Now I stand in the school auditorium in front of my PowerPoint being projected on 20ft high screen. I see to my right are my supporters, my wife, her boss and a couple of colleagues (and friends). In front of me sat 200, highly sugared, 13 and 14 year olds, and multiple levels of school management, including a the deputy head who taught me when I was at school. Instantly all the words that I had meticulously planned flowed from my head, unfortunately not via my lips; my mind was left blank for what felt like an eternity. Quickly looking back at the screen I quickly started ad-libbing my way through a few slides, until I got to the powerful video ‘stand up kid’.,The ‘Stand up kid’ video (a must watch and should be played in every school) gave me 3 minutes of breathing space. When everyone else in the room had the video's powerful message fresh in their minds, I re- enter the arena. Like a man waiting for the lions to be released, in the Coliseum, I stand up and give my main message: “I have depression, but am I scary to talk to?”. Then, like a subconscious release, I spoke of when I remember my ‘problems’ starting in year 9, their age group, after extensive bullying which then lead to me doing anything to avoid going to school. I admitted to injuring myself in what appeared to be accidental ways to avoid my stressors; my school ‘friends’, people who I had to deal with everyday.,I continued to speak and got across the message of the importance of feeling free to speak to others about mental health. I had 200 13 and 14 year olds, looking shocked that statistically 1 in 10 children and young people has a mental health issue, that equates to three in every class room. I finished the session without showing how much I had unintentionally released to the group- I felt a weight had been released, a weight that I had not even been aware of. I felt euphoric.,I felt a new energy when doing the other sessions that week, along with the conversations I had whilst giving information at my little stand. I started a great number of conversations among staff and students that week which continued for some time, I educated many young people that week, and I think I managed to pave the way for a few in need."
,"I have had problems with depression for my whole adult life. , Despite running as fast as I can away from it, with a desperation to put it behind me, it always comes back. For all my successes, for all my acceptance and understanding of myself, for all my progress as a well-adjusted adult, it won't leave me.,It's scary. And it's terrible. At first it wiped away my optimism. At its worst I would wake up in the middle of the night, swamped in sweat, with an utter, sheer bleakness. I was 19 when I read an article in a student newspaper describing exactly the problems I was having, it was called depression. Everything can be going well in my life, and it will still hijack my feelings.,Antidepressants have helped, as have talking therapies. I have been making use of both of these off and on for the last 15 years. Often, I have thought that my problems had been put behind me. I went back to university to get a First in my degree, I won a place over hundreds of candidates to gain my first serious job on a graduate scheme, and I now do a job that I am passionate about. I had a wonderful girlfriend who has become my beautiful wife, and is now also a great mother to our little boy, our boy who makes my heart flip with joy.,Depression has always come back to haunt me, and to grab me in its vice-like grip. When I first started having problems with my mental health, when I was about 16 or 17, I felt guilty. I felt as though through the choices I had made in my life I had brought problems on myself. I analysed my life and attempted to correct any imperfections. I would now be the perfect student/ son/ friend/ boyfriend. Unfortunately, this just made things worse. By trying to be perfect I was doomed to constant failure, I got caught in a vicious and unpleasant cycle of feeling worse and worse and trying to make up for it by being 'better' and 'better'. I felt that I had no right to be depressed and that it was my fault. Thoughts that have had their echoes in others' reactions to it.,There has been a lot of shame in the way that I have thought about and acted on my mental health problems. First of all from my side, I have been ashamed to be honest about how I felt and I have tried to keep it from people, which has made it difficult for some of those who care about me to talk to me about it. And also from others, there has been a reluctance from some people close to me to accept it and engage with me about it; on telling one employer that I was struggling with depression, they responded with 'well that's obvious, it's written all over your face. It's not our responsibility if you've joined our company with existing psychological problems.' One friend epitomised a fairly frequent view when they commented that they knew people with real problems who actually had things to be depressed about. Attitudes like that have made me all the keener to think I could put it behind me and present myself as 'normal'.,Before I had a problem with depression, I was ignorant about it. I thought that people should 'get over themselves' if they had a mental health problem. I understand that we as a society have a long way to go before there is enough information and honesty about mental health in the public domain. There are two main reasons I support the Time to Change campaign to put an end to mental health discrimination and stigma. First, for myself now, and people like me, it would be good if there was no reason not to be honest about how we felt and what state our mental health was in; to be able to look after ourselves and seek professional help in an open way. And second, for people like I was when I was young. To be young, and to have a mental health problem and not understand it, and to feel guilty about it seems to me to be tremendously sad and an indictment of our society in 21st century Britain.,I am proud of myself, all aspects of myself. Like everyone, I have flaws, these are not a product of my mental health, they are just my flaws. I experience depression, there is also much more to me and I'm happy to be open about all of it."
,"I had a dark period of , for just over two years, not that I knew it at the time. , It had become the norm to feel dead behind the eyes, empty, numb and generally dire at all times. My weekends would involve a breakfast of crying followed by a coffee and cry for lunch, a long sleep on the sofa to forget I was even there, then a dinner of tears and a sob to sleep. It was bleak.,I had suffered a dreadful heartbreak months before which left me crushed internally and unable to feel anything. It was also a major factor in my decision to give up my career as a singer and songwriter. I was so twisted with pain I physically couldn’t sing, and there were only , many songs I could write “He’s left me, I’m DEAD!” My passion had abandoned me along with my inner spirit that normally lifts the room, instead - I couldn’t leave my room.,While I was aware that something wasn’t right, it took a hit of gastroenteritis which I carried on with oblivious for two weeks, then a serious bout of face swelling glandular fever which left me unable to move, and my Mum feeding me in order to say - enough! I could almost handle the emotional deadness of depression, but seeing my face look like a puma was too much for me.,I took the plunge and saw my doctor. Speaking to someone honestly about how I felt on a daily basis made the floodgates of frozen emotion race out like a tidal wave, and there it was - I was depressed. I explained the feeling of having a pair of hands crawl up my back and press down on my shoulders, that how I saw it in my mind so I could identify what ‘it’ was. But as I spoke to her, I also felt utter relief for the first time in years. As I left the surgery and walked home, I felt alive and present. I smiled, I breathed the fresh air - I felt semi normal again, just from talking. A session with a therapist followed who just brilliant, and by the time the session was over he told me to “Get out of here!” (joking) as I was fine. By opening up to my doctor then him, he explained how I was one of the ‘lucky’ ones who reach to bottom, realize it, then bounce back up. My god, I was lucky. I left him and never looked back, and as quick as my recovery was, I will never forgot the feeling of those hands on my back, no escape seemed possible.,In a matter of days I noticed the colour return to my cheeks and a sparkle to my eyes - I looked like me again! That period of my life stays with always. It makes me feel able to deal with anything, ,. After feeling like you’re a spec of dust waiting to be swept away, you just don’t sweat the small stuff - it does not matter. A break up, a crappy day, a job loss, or being unable to make rent, they all pale into the background after you’ve experienced depression. I feel the strongest possible version of myself due to my depression and I wouldn’t change it for the world. Who knows who I would be without? Would I really know what pain was? How would I cope with everyday things that seem to drive sane people to tears? I don’t know. I do know however, that an open honest attitude to mental health is just as essential to helping others with depression.,I didn’t tell my family or colleagues about my therapy, only a few select friends at the time knew, as I knew there would be that look of “there’s something wrong with you”. Narrow minds would pop me into a category and harp back to it anytime I felt a bit off colour, so why share. That was over ten years ago for me, and thankfully I feel the stigma attached to having depression is massively diminishing today. Indeed some of the most wonderful creative minds have fallen victim to the illness, and come away for the experience, like myself, mentally richer for it.,I also know, that it doesn’t matter what someone says to you to try and help, the best will in the world can’t shake the feeling of helplessness, but, if we do keep talking about mental health, openly, proudly and freely without fear of others labelling those who experience mental illness, it , help.,Since my depression I have lived my life by the law of attraction, and I can honestly say I feel happy every single day. That’s not to say I don’t get pissed off from time to time, but ultimately, it just doesn’t matter. People often ask me how I am so genuinely happy and positive all the time, and my answer is recovering from depression - nothing will , be that bad again, so bring it on."
," ,As a child, I was always somewhat awkward. , After making and subsequently losing friends at high school due to fairly bad social anxiety, I felt like the most useless person in the world. My parents absolutely could not get me to go and see a counsellor as I believed that requiring help rendered me even more of an outcast than I already felt that I was.,From this first experience of depression followed many more. Changing my persona various times throughout my teenage years, triggers would always bring me back to the same stage of hopeless depression. Thinking back to these moments later on, I would never understand why I had felt so utterly helpless and would consider how I had felt at the time to have been an over-reaction to whatever circumstances were happening at the time. I would either judge myself for being weak or pretend that it never happened. Blocking out the bad times - which often lasted for months - led me to believe that my problem was not as bad as it really was. ,By age 19, I felt contented with my life. After a bad couple of years, I felt that my life had transformed and I now had friends at university and work, as well as being in a happy relationship. This all changed in the blink of an eye one day. Whilst having a light-hearted conversation with a friend, a mistake I had made years before was jokingly mentioned. This triggered a major depressive episode for me. All I could remember or think about was all the bad things I had ever done, every minute of every day. I awoke to a throbbing emotional pain each day and tried desperately to put myself back to sleep to make it stop. In my desperate pursuit to become a mental health professional, I refused to see a doctor in denial of the fact that I could be the one in need of help. Additionally, I wholly believed that I deserved the pain I was in for all the awful things I believed myself to have done.,Unsure of how to express this pain to anyone, I would force myself to attend university. I felt unable to speak to anyone. I watched everyone go on with their every day lives as if from a different world, believing I would never feel normal again. As it happens, I did, although it took around 6 months. As a result, however, many friendships had faded away. In one instance I apologised to a close friend for my behaviour, claiming it resulted from a period of depression. The friend never responded, which further fuelled my misconception that it was taboo to speak about such things and I forced myself to forget once more.,I experienced periods of depression thereafter, although not to the same extent. However, a few months before leaving university, I had my worst period of depression yet. Realising I had lost social contacts, was doing badly in classes and had managed to substantially isolate myself from university life overwhelmed me to the point of breakdown. I often wouldn't get up for days at a time and it was necessary to extend the period of time I was allowed to finish my degree. It is very hard to describe the extent of the agony I felt or the logic behind why I had such extreme feelings. I do know that I seriously considered taking my own life and I knew at this stage that I couldn't continue living in denial any longer.,Seeking out a counsellor, I was advised to see a doctor for clinical depression. Doing so has marked a very important step in my life. I realise that I sought out psychology and a helping profession in some way because I knew I needed help myself. Since acknowledging this, there has been a marked improvement in my quality of life. My fear of stigma and being considered an outcast seems trivial when contrasted with the benefits I have reaped from admitting that I have a problem and seeking help for it.,I am writing this blog because, since this point, I have found it beneficial for my own personal well-being to be very open and honest about my experiences. People's reactions have not been what I was expecting, with the majority of people reacting with compassion and support. I have experienced little to no stigma since opening up about my depression, in contrast to what I had been expecting from the social isolation. I now believe that no-one should suffer in silence. Doing so results in isolation and worsens the pain. I stress that people react much more positively than may be anticipated and that admitting you have a problem is the first step to understanding how it can be worked through and resolved. It may be incredibly difficult but taking that step will prove invaluable; it did for me."
,"It took me a while to tell all my friends about my depression. It wasn’t something I really wanted to talk about at first. It was only when I started to open up about it that I realised how much talking helped. ,My friends just accepted it, and without making a big deal about it they let me know they were looking out for me. I began to find out about other people’s experiences, which helped too.,Here are six ways you can support a friend who’s going through depression, based on what I’ve valued most. "
,"I have always suffered with “nerves” as they used to call it in a less enlightened times. , The mere thought of going to school would see me dissolve into a flood of tears. Supposedly enjoyable events and situations, like playing football and cricket which are hard wired into the young male brain, would be akin to trial by ordeal. Don’t get me wrong, I loved to play football and cricket, but mainly in the street with kids much younger than me, where there was no pressure or blame if you were not having a good game.,Schoolwork was another issue. Giving speeches and reading aloud in class were a source of terror, so much so, that I would be physically sick at the thought of having to stand up and talk or read aloud. I felt ashamed, at my cowardice and did not know how to control it. I simply pretended that everything was ok, which it was not. But hey! It was the 70’s after all, and we were light years away from understanding mental health problems.,In 1979, the problem became so acute, that after a horrific panic/anxiety attack during my mid year exams when I was 17, in which I simply froze rigid with fear during a history paper, I decided that I could not face going back into the exam hall to sit my finals. Not wanting to appear weak, and not knowing who to talk to or who to turn to, I took some pills. Lying in bed panic stricken, I decided to confess my desperate deed to my parents. This resulted in an overnight stay in hospital. I was referred to the school psychologist, which was a total waste of time. I felt that I could not talk to anyone, for several reasons. Firstly, in South Africa, men were supposed to be men. Having feelings, let alone talking about them, just never happened - unless they were connected to cars, girls or rugby. Secondly, anxiety was looked upon as having a lack of moral fibre, a sign of weakness, a blight that should be swept away out of sight.,Fast forward to 2014, surprisingly, nothing has changed much for me. I have still battled on through all of my working life with , and ,, pretending that everything is ok, and that I am normal. I have been signed off work on three separate occasions totalling almost twelve months with anxiety and depression, and on each occasion, friends and colleagues have been the last to know. I have used all my powers and energies keeping up the pretence that I was OK, when all the time I would be crying out inside. I have felt ashamed, weak and worthless that I have been saddled with these mental health illnesses. At times I think I would happily trade my depression and anxiety for cancer. At least that way I could talk openly about it, nay shout it from the roof tops, without the fear of stigma from friends and work colleagues.,The most recent occasion when I had to take time away from work, was after deciding to join a fast paced section which dealt with the public. I soon discovered that I was totally out of my depth. I was struggling to keep pace in the fast environment where thinking on your feet was a pre-requisite. After several weeks of trying to cope and trying to keep my anxiety in check, I had the week from hell where everything went wrong. As per usual, I had maintained the great pretence that I was coping, and as far as everybody else knew, I was in control and ok. I was signed off work for seven weeks after which I asked to rejoin my old section. Upon my return to work, some colleagues were very supportive, but my former colleagues from the other section treated me with either total indifference or contempt, as if some great act of treason had been committed. I decided to keep my illness to myself and just carried on pretending as per usual. After all, who wants to hear from a “loser” about his mental health problems, when everyone else has their own lives.,For me there has been no eureka moment, no liberation of the soul. The forces of darkness and despair have not been repelled and vanquished. I have simply carried on as normal, pretending to friends, and colleagues that everything is alright. I have not found the courage to come out about my mental health problems, because of prejudice and stigma, and since I have subsequently been made redundant at Christmas time, I have found looking for work and a new direction, a challenge in itself. I still have reservations about being totally open and honest with some people about my condition, afraid of their reaction and quite possibly their awkward recoil. But I have decided to try rightly or wrongly to stop pretending anymore, and to be up front with regards to my mental health problems. I am working on the basis that whichever potential employer sees me for the person I am and not the illness, will be the right fit for me. Time to start living, and to stop pretending."
," ,, suicide and , define some of the most challenging events myself and my family have experienced. , For me depression was crying regularly and not even knowing why, wishing I was anyone but myself, and enduring unfortunate family circumstances. Being listened to and unconditionally loved (as well as a boost from medication) helped me recover. I’m now in a great job, loving relationship and healthy state of mind. My personal life goal is simply to stay happy.,For my sister, she endured torture from her enemy- the voice inside her head. Experiencing anorexia, bulimia and severe depression she spent a total of nine months on an adolescent mental health ward. I now know what it means when people say they go into auto-pilot, as myself and my parents did exactly that. I struggle to remember things from that period, apart from nearly losing hope that my sister would survive. Eating disorders are so easily misunderstood as stubbornness towards eating, but the internal battles behind it can be massive. I saw my sister cry over eating a mouthful of food and she welcomed the idea of suicide over continuing with this mind-set.,Can you pin-point the worst day of your life? I can give you mine. It was the day my ‘second mum’ (childhood nanny) took her life. Telling my sister, while she was already so ill, was destroying. I felt like I’d lost the two people closest to me. Yet I managed to hide all of this from most people I knew. I still smiled in lectures, got on with most of my life and appeared (fairly) normal.,Through very small steps my sister has now recovered. You’d never guess that she had the outlook she did. She’s the bubbliest person I know. She’s experienced the impact suicide has on those who are left behind and is now training to be an amazing mental health nurse.,My main reason for writing this is to get across the point that mental health difficulties aren’t a case of ‘pulling your act together’. Often people who haven’t experienced mental health problems find it hard to understand. My most supportive friend was the one who somehow empathised. If you’re not a sufferer I hope you don’t have to understand, just please bear in mind that it’s not a quick fix or a choice. The things I found most effective were people who were just there. I look up to Time to Change for bringing this simple fact to light. Talking, tea and time- they’re good starting points."
,"“Even though I have been a HR Director in various industries for quite a long time, it took me a while to learn that I have a tendency towards ,. I would have peaks and troughs in my performance, and I had always muddled through them and come out the other side.,It wasn’t until six years ago when I had a personal family tragedy that things became really serious. My sister was dying 12,000 miles away in Australia, and for a period of seven weeks I was commuting back and forth to look after her and to be there for my family. I went straight back into work after she passed and took on bigger projects and more work. After 12 months I keeled over. I couldn’t think, I couldn’t answer the phone, and I was turning up to meetings unprepared.,My employers were brilliant. My manager was very supportive and we discussed what I was dealing with and agreed that I should take a few weeks off. Unfortunately things took a turn for the worse and I didn’t go back to work for another six months. During this time they were incredibly supportive and understanding. They gave me the space and time I needed and also gave me a ‘buddy’ who kept in touch and met up with me a few times during my time off. And when I eventually went back to work I had a phased return.,Fast forward to 2013 and my current organisation. As part of the programme to support staff, a colleague suggested that the company sign the ,. I thought this was a great idea, and saw an opportunity to add a personal side to the signing, to talk about how it feels to cope with mental health problems at work. I wanted to break down the perception that you have to deal with things privately, and that actually if you open up then people can support you. Standing up and talking about my story was one of the hardest presentations I’ve ever had to do. I felt vulnerable and nervous about the reaction I would get. Afterwards I felt like a weight had been lifted from my shoulders and I no longer had to deal with things in private.,When you work closely with people they are bound to notice a change in your behaviour. In my previous organisation, before people knew about my mental health problems, my team couldn’t understand what I was going through, and because they didn’t know there was a problem they couldn’t make allowances or put support in place. They could only judge me as if I was ‘normal’ and assume I was unreliable and not good at my job, which was quite stressful and challenging. It became much easier when I opened up and I’m confident that if I ever have problems again people will be able to support me better. The overall reaction was positive; my team were glad that they understood my issues, and some were surprised because they hadn’t spotted anything wrong, and others were surprised that I was prepared to talk about it.,Since I spoke out I haven’t seen any evidence that anybody looks at me differently. Mental health isn’t a taboo subject at work anymore, and people are starting to feel more comfortable knowing that they can open up if they need to and they will get the support they need. It’s brought about more of a culture of talking.,I wouldn’t have opened up without the , signing. It was something I had wanted to do before but now I felt that I was in a trusted environment. The pledge gave me the opportunity to feel comfortable about speaking out.”, , "
,"The day the doctor said: ,“These seizures you are having are non-epileptic.”,It was really frustrating. I wanted to actually know what was going on - they had done all kinds of tests.,“The only option is to send you to a psychiatric hospital for children and adolescents,” he said.,“… Hang on there”, I said, “You only have just told me.”,It was like one extreme to another - I couldn’t get my head around it. I was diagnosed with ,, social , and , disorder. Due to the seizures, I felt everyone disintegrated around me as they didn't understand what it fully was. I hated it and it made me feel so isolated from everyone; friends and family hated me not communicating as I wouldn't talk to them, but they didn't know that I just couldn't cope with everything. I had a big fear of telling them about my condition as I didn't know how they were going to react if I did. This is how the social anxiety particularly started.,I absolutely hated school, completing just 2 full years. I just completely hated myself, didn’t really care about my education or social life; I just wanted to hide away in a corner. I wouldn’t talk to anyone the way I felt about it. In 2012 my mental health condition gradually improved… I felt I was free. I was discharged from the therapy department that I went to, which felt great! I went on to succeeded in my GCSEs, despite all the difficulties.,This may seem like the end of my story, but you'd be wrong...,During November 2013 I had reached an all-time low point. I started hearing voices. I wasn't sure to start with; I actually thought it was my mind playing tricks on me but I realised it wasn't at all. I kept skipping college. Even though I disliked social events anyway, they decreased rapidly and transport was a big issue for me. I starting thinking that everyone was staring at me and talking about me behind my back. My mental health got worse, and some things came back but I was also showing new signs of mental health issues including mood swings, sleep issues, voices, self-injury, low mood. I also didn't know how to control my mood and I kept shouting and throwing things on the ﬂoor. I didn't know what was happening at all. I just completely hated myself; I just wanted to hide away in a corner. I wouldn’t talk to anyone about the way I felt. Everyone was trying to help but I just pushed them away every time they were trying to help. I forced a smile on my face just to say to someone “I’m ﬁne”, but really inside there was a blackness and it was like sitting in a room with no lights on.,When my mental health condition got worse last year, my Mum and Dad made me go and see a specialist psychiatrist in London. I didn't know what to think. This was the time that I actually realised that there was something wrong with me and this was not normal for a teenage girl of 17. It had taken me 6 years to notice… I had to go in as an inpatient - this time I actually didn't mind. I wanted everything to go away but I especially wanted the voices and the hallucinations because I was terriﬁed of my own mind. I eventually got diagnosed with more than one mental health condition (severe depression, anxiety and PTSD).,Talking was my ﬁrst step towards recovery and it still is. I have learned that one step a time helps rather than big ones. I spent 15 weeks as an inpatient and I actually understood why all of this was happening to me. Being an inpatient helped me to understand that I wasn't alone, helped me to learn what my symptoms meant and learned how to cope with them with the right treatment and help I needed."
,"I didn't know what it was to be on my knees, what it felt like to feel isolated day after day, not able to explain an illness that was destroying my existence. ,To feel consumed both emotionally and physically, feeling hopeless and unable to control anything in my life - in fact, not caring about anything in my life. That was until I became depressed.,The thing with depression, is that it takes time to manifest itself, like a disease just gnawing away. You feel a bit down, so isolate yourself from friends for a couple of days, you start to feel indifferent about the interests you once loved and you notice your confidence drops too. At the same time, you don't want to be a burden to family/friends so you either force happiness or you shun them away. Sometimes it is both.,Socialising seems pointless...in fact everything seems so pointless. Things in your mind are moving so slowly, even you're moving slowly - unable to get out of bed, not bothering with make up and personal hygiene. You have no focus, just want to sleep a lot because you don't want to deal with all these dark feelings.,I don't know the exact solution to getting straight back up again when feeling that low. I know it's easier to fall down than to get back up, but I also believe that you can still get back up again even though it may take longer. If you can drag yourself out of your bed to a GP surgery that would be a good start. Or even phone a close friend or family member. You could do it right now from the comfort of your own bed. Get something like an appointment set in stone. If you're not doing much else, then what have you got to lose?,I know that just like depression takes time to manifest and doesn't happen over night, then neither will getting fully better again. With depression, it can be very difficult to make decisions, decide what is causing you so much pain and therefore you might go back to old habits without realising. An outsider can help you eliminate the bad, self-destructive habits and work towards getting you back to your old self. I believe there is hope in the most darkest moments, that we can only ever really truly appreciate the value of something until we have lost everything.,Most importantly, I believe in determination, and every day I am inspired and amazed by the people who will not give up. The marathon runners who kept running despite water supplies being cut off, our men and women in uniform preparing to give their life for Queen and country, the Women of Steel who worked tirelessly in the Steel factories during the Second World War, whilst men were sent to the frontline - never thanked or praised and fired when the men returned home. Every day, I am influenced and feel encouraged to be more like them.,There is a life out there if you are willing to try and get back up again. You may need support, you may need courage, but there is light at the top of the pit you've found yourself in. I've lived life well and I've also seen the darker side to life. No one ever has the intention of going under, mental illness is not deliberate or attention seeking. It becomes a state of being when you are too tired to get back up and stand on two feet. Yet, I say hang on in there, because you will learn to stand back up again. It will just take time."
,"As a person who has mental health difficulties, I can understand the importance of things in life. , The routine of life, the knowledge of how good and bad days affect us (particular people with mental health difficulties) and the way people with mental health issues can be judged. One thing I have learnt most though is who I can truly trust and rely upon. On my journey with mental health, I was very fortunate to have a close ,around me - although not all of them understood the condition, the ones that did really tried their best to support me.,College life for me was completely different to school life, I didn’t feel alone or judged. Everyone was treated as an equal and even some of the tutors made you feel better, it was a much better environment. I recall on my first day of college, meeting some ‘wild’ people, they were full of energy and laughing and joking. Something I had forgot how to do! After a few days with these people, I classed them as ‘close’ friends and continued hanging around with them for the rest of the year.,On the second, third and fourth year at college, I made a tremendous amount of friends. They wanted to listen to my problems, they bothered to include me for being me, and I didn’t have to pretend I was all okay, when actually I wasn’t. I was included without having to change, it was great! I told my friends I had mental health problems at college, most seemed to understand and offer support to me when I felt low in mood, they could often see this as I became very down and anxious. I hated pretending I was well and everything was fine, that would be a lie and hiding from my mental health state. A similar story to this is Eeyore from Winnie the Pooh, many saw him as a ‘depressive, gloomy character’ who most probably wouldn’t want to be around, however Winnie the Pooh and his friends, didn’t leave Eeyore out for being different and as a result, he felt included and involved. This should be the example that all ‘FRIENDS’ have when finding out their friend has mental health. Otherwise are they really friends?,I felt more involved at college, than I ever did before. I didn’t want to give up anymore and my friends kept me involved with almost everything they did. I didn’t have stigma to contend with on a daily basis and it began to feel less of a worry! If I could choose a second family, it unquestionably would be these guys.,My friends mean the world to me, some I class as family. It can feel like you’re isolated when being told you have a mental health condition. Depression, for me, was the wake-up call I didn’t, at first, want to accept. However, having depression for many years has taught me who my true friends are and the ones that aren’t around today are not really worth worrying about! So friends really are the family we choose, without my friends, I wouldn’t have the motivation to continue pursuing my dreams, nor would I feel involved."
,"Although there should be no need to keep one’s mental health condition a secret, I can totally understand why many people decide to keep it so as I have firsthand knowledge of the stigma that results from work colleagues finding out about it. ,Unfortunately, I did not have the luxury of hiding my condition as I was spectacularly and publically ‘outed’ as psychologically damaged when 19 years of undiagnosed, and therefore untreated, depression and stress caused me to have a breakdown at work.,It is hard to hide a mental illness when you have been surrounded by your work colleagues whilst you are huddled in the foetal position under your desk, sobbing your heart out and unable to respond to the people around you but still totally aware of everything that is going on around you. I was taken to hospital and had the rest of the week off sick, hardly time to properly convalesce but a decision made because I did not want to lose my job; however, when I returned, I came back to a very different collegial relationship with the people I shared a workplace with.,I had suddenly been given the nickname ‘psycho’ and people were reluctant to approach me. The little respect I once had amongst my fellow workers diminished visibly and I was seen as less than the man I once was. Oh, there was sympathy shown towards me by some but there was also a distance that I had to fight against and some took liberties with my personal belongings that they would never taken before. I had to fight twice as hard to gain half the respect that seemed to be lavished on the others.,Every time the nickname ‘psycho’ was used it felt like a rapier (sword) being thrust deep into my heart and it simply added to the self-hatred I had been feeling on the 19-year journey along the dark path of depression I had endured alone. Every fearful glance in my direction and every cautious approach made me feel damaged, alone, isolated. Every disrespectful use of my personal belongings made me feel less human than the people I was surrounded by on a daily basis because it did not seem to matter to them that the belongings were mine; they seemed to be of the opinion that I no longer deserved the respect of being asked because I was somehow broken. My intelligence was called into question, subtly to be true but it was there, and any suggestions I made to improve the work environment had to be repeatedly made before any real notice was taken.,The incalculable damage my work colleagues caused me with their stigmatisation during that period never really healed but it has made me the outspoken advocate of mental health awareness I am today. I now use my experiences to inform people of the damage they cause with their negative attitudes towards mental ill health in the sincere hope that it changes their attitudes just a little."
,"There was a time three years ago which I often identify as the time where I was at my worst. As an international student in his first year spending the Christmas break on campus was not easy. I was deeply depressed (although did not know the name at the time) and would spend the entire day in my room for weeks on end apart from going for the occasional run. I was also anxious and felt unable to connect with anyone.,Being a psychology student was a blessing and a curse. It was a blessing because it slowly made me see that what I am experiencing is legitimate and normal and there are people dedicating their lives to studying and helping people with depression and anxiety. But it was also a curse because studying psychology made me see just how much some people struggle and suffer from their mental health difficulty. And that was not me – I was still able to attend lectures and get my coursework done after all. It made me feel I did not deserve any support because I felt guilty for taking away the limited resources that someone else would need a lot more than me. I felt I was not unwell enough.,But I was unwell. And no matter how much I tried to hide and contain it the pain started seeping out of me. In the form of words like the ones you are reading now. First a private journal, then in private messages to people who barely knew me but I felt safe (and desperate) enough to tell them. And then I couldn’t hold it anymore and I wrote it all down in a blog. Several blog posts, a whole week’s worth. I poured all of my pain and suffering into words and told the world. And I kept on writing and another Christmas came and once again I was feeling so helpless and wounded but I braved to bare my wounds to the world. I was feeling out of control and was scared I would harm myself and I told that to everyone.,A few days later I got an email from my university tutor who is also the course director for the clinical psychology course I am doing. He asked me to come in for a chat to talk about how things are going. This was unusual, but deep down I knew what this was about – one of my course mates had read my blog and informed him about it. And so I went and for the first time I told someone who was not my friend about how I was feeling and that I found things really difficult. And my tutor listened and did not judge. He offered support, an open ear, mentioned the university counselling service, and the possibility of medication if I wanted. He did not do any magic and he did what everyone would have done. He cared.,But to me that chat changed everything. Because I suddenly felt I was allowed to feel like this. And I was allowed to seek help. All this time I did not allow myself to seek the support I needed because I felt guilty about being miserable and depressed and anxious in my circumstances. I needed someone else to tell me that it was normal to feel like this and that I could go and get help. I realised that I desperately wanted help but I needed someone else to give me permission. I realised that in my blog posts I was crying out for support and deep down I knew all I needed was someone to say “You are not alone in this and it’s not forever. You can get help.” And that is just what my tutor did. I made a GP appointment on the same day.,I am now just finishing my second month of antidepressant medication. I have also had my third session of counselling. It has completely transformed my life. The medication has markedly decreased my anxiety and I can now get through most days without constantly being on the edge. The counselling has made me more compassionate towards myself and look after myself better. I am still struggling with depression creeping back in from time to time, but I made a commitment not to let mental illness ruin my life anymore.,And I still write and that still helps me enormously. I now live openly with my mental health difficulties and it is the best decision I ever made. "
,"1 in 4 people are affected by mental health.,I never thought I’d be one of those people.,Recently I decided to tell someone who I thought I could trust about my 6 year struggle with depression.For years I have kept it hidden from family and friends and in February 2014 finally plucked up the courage to speak out. Unfortunately this was a huge mistake. He was not supportive or understanding as I hoped he would be. I’ve never felt so humiliated and embarrassed in all my life and believe me I don’t embarrass easily.,For the first time in my life I finally opened up and actually uttered the words “ I have depression.” I couldn’t believe it I had finally said it. “I have depression.” And he just stood there. Expressionless. Motionless.I don’t know what I expected. But his reaction was not reassuring or comforting. And as hurtful as that was and still pains me today I won’t let it ruin me.I did a very brave thing and I’m proud of that. And in a way it doesn’t matter now because I have now found the strength to tell my other friends and my mum and dad the true extent of my problem and they have been fantastic and very supportive.,I know it’s difficult for someone who hasn’t experienced depression to understand how it makes me feel, but the important thing is that they listen. Sometimes all I need is a hug think people think that having depression makes you unstable and their lack of understanding about it makes it that much more difficult to deal with it. The hardest part is because people can’t see depression I feel like they don’t think it’s real. But it’s as real as the nose on my face. The affects it has on my life have been horrendous and extremely challenging but I’ve kept it very well hidden because of the stigma attached.,But now aged 22 I’m no longer ashamed or embarrassed to admit I am suffering from depression. And I have been suffering and still am because it affects me at any given day and I can’t stop it but I’m learning how to deal with it.  Truth be told I’ve been lying to myself for the past 6 years, convincing myself that these episodes of feeling tearful, ashamed, worthless were down to hormones and all part of growing up.,One day in 2010 I didn’t get out of bed for 4 days, I barely opened my eyes just lay there wishing I didn’t wake up the next day. As painful as it is to admit that, there have been several episodes of this, and whilst I’ve never attempted suicide, these negative feelings became so dark and controlling I knew that something was wrong and I had to see my GP. It's now 2014 and I’m in the process of having therapy sessions don’t know what to expect or what I will gain from it.,All I know is I , to ,I do not want to be a statistic."
,"I am a teacher, and have been for over a decade. When not in the classroom I produce techno and ambient music and have had tracks released on a wide range of labels. I also dj around London.,I did try and let things out with the names I gave my tracks. Frustration, Belonging, Simplicity, Good Old Days. Inside I knew something was wrong, and had done for a while, but outside I carried on as usual, teaching by day, producing and dj'ing by night. I ignored the physical symptoms of anxiety and depression, the dark mood, insomnia, crying by myself, irritability, et cetera and carried on until one Tuesday evening I melted down, laid down in the foetal position and just cried, and shook, and cried, and shook. My brain pressed the reset button and depression had me.,My wife knew and protected me, telling her family I wasn't myself, that I was taking things slowly. My parents knew a bit also, but usually the edited lowlights until I melted down. But it was telling my French mother in law, in French, what was going on in my head, that brought me the most comfort.,My wife was in hospital for an operation and my mother in law and I would have to spend the day together waiting for her to come out of surgery. My mood was black that day, so dark and gloomy, I could barely spit a word out in English, let alone French. My wife was taken into theatre and my mother in law and I were decanted to the hospital cafe. I couldn't take my eyes off of the floor.,We spoke, slowly, in broken French and English, I told her how I felt, my fears, frustrations, internal arguments, about people I'd let down, people I'd pushed away, promises I'd broken. She listened, she cried, I cried, but we talked. And every day after that, as well as looking after my wife and her daughter, we talked. It felt good to think through what I wanted to say, translate it, then let it out. She was a good listener, yes everyone's a good listener, but she was a GOOD listener, non judgemental despite her vested interest in me. Every negative I came out with, she made it a positive. If I'd pushed people away I could reconnect, and besides, it wasn't the real me doing that, it was my illness.,She told me how she saw me, a strong, funny man (the complete opposite of how I felt). Knowing I could speak to her just felt like a weight was being lifted off of my shoulders. I knew it wasn't the only solution, but it was part of the solution, away from the medication and the therapy, it was a familiar face who had seen me grow over the past 12 years.,Slowly I find myself on the way to recovery, with a good support network around me, and my mother in law on the phone to me every day. It's good to talk."
,"The realisation that I may not be entirely straight did not sit well with me at first. At 19 I felt I was somehow late to the party and had missed out on some important LGBT rite of passage (no, I don’t know what either). Throughout my teenage years I struggled with a depression that consumed all aspects of my life, and ultimately left me more interested in controlling my suicidal urges than kissing someone. In hindsight, I think this was probably what resulted in me essentially not noticing that I wasn’t straight. Regrettably, I think I probably just repressed a lot of the feelings I had at the time – which didn’t help with the depression either.,It was at the end of my first year of university that I started questioning my sexuality. I had reached the other side of a bout of depression that had lasted 7 years and had been travelling and got a first in my end of year exams. I was, for the first time I could properly remember, truly happy. It was around this time that my best friend asked if I was asexual. I was shocked. Whilst I was sure that I wasn’t asexual, I never realised that those close to me had taken notice of my lack of romantic history. Slowly, I began to understand why I’d never been able to imagine myself falling in love with a guy. It’s hard to get across just how difficult I found this process. Not only did I feel unbelievably angry and frustrated with myself that I ‘hadn’t noticed’ my own sexuality, but absolutely terrified of the obstacles that I felt I would encounter.,For a time I relapsed into my old ways as I was completely overwhelmed, and unfortunately this wasn’t helped by the reactions I sometimes encountered. I was incredibly lucky when I told my close friends that everyone was supportive, however my coming out was often met with ‘I always thought you were gay’ or another similar comment. I know categorically that my friends were not saying this to upset me, but it made me feel as though I really had no idea who I was, and perhaps even worse, that everyone else knew me better than I knew myself. Equally difficult was the knowledge that people thought my coming out as liking both genders was just a stepping-stone to coming out as a lesbian. It is very, very hard to tell people something about yourself that could quite easily be met with antipathy, and having people effectively not believe me was difficult. I’m now stronger than I was and know that orientation is a difficult thing for some people to get their head around, but at the time I struggled with it a great deal.,I’m at the point now where I have come out to the majority of my friends and family – both in terms of my struggles with mental health and my orientation. I definitely think that the process of telling people about your mental illness and your sexual orientation are very similar. Whilst both can be difficult, I think doing so is an incredibly worthwhile process that can help to reduce stigma and strengthen relationships. I’m a firm believer that honesty sparks honesty, and I’ve had so many eye-opening conversations with people after I’ve shared things about myself. Now that I’m in a good place and am able to talk openly about my experiences, I do try to start conversations around both subjects. I know from when I was struggling that if I met someone who was open about his or her history, I would have felt more comfortable being open about my own. I have no doubt that communication has been one of the most significant contributing factors to my recovery, which is why I support the work of Time to Change."
,"I wish I could say that being there for a loved one when they are going through Depression is easy, you are carried by your Love for them and never ever have fear, doubt or frustration during the process. ,That is obviously flowery love rubbish. It’s hard, you doubt, you have fear, you are frustrated, but the best of us stick by and fight alongside this loved one because you , love them.,I am so lucky to have my partner. Alex has been my cornerstone, my resting place, my rock, my sanity and so many times my sounding board when the roiling thoughts in my head just needed to get out. I know he won’t mind me saying though, that he didn’t necessarily start out this way, because neither of us had any idea how to start dealing with my depression.,First step is to talk, even this can be an incredibly difficult, no matter how good you are at opening up to your partner, no matter how close you are, this is that next step to admission, admit it to yourself, admit it to those closest to you.,My advice, only some of which I followed with Alex, but in hindsight have learned; prepare for the conversation, have a strong idea of how you want to word what you have to say. I would start by asking that your partner allow you to finish what you have to say before asking any questions. I would have some print outs or websites open that detail the symptoms of Depression to help put your symptoms into perspective, and most importantly, be 100% honest.,While going through Depression with your partner is difficult, I have struggled even more with friends, I will admit that I wasn’t there for a friend who herself had Depression, I had no idea how. When you or your partner is going through Depression, you are there with them, day-to-day, dealing with the emotions, the confusions. You typically have opportunities to talk, or just to be there and to hold the other and make them feel like everything is okay, just so long as you are cuddling.,However, with friends it is easy to continue on in your life without thinking about what a friend is going through constantly. Furthermore, every one is different with what they need, each stage of depression requires a different approach, if you don’t see each other every day it’s tricky to understand what they need at that time.,At the beginning of my depression I was in my avoidance phase, if I wasn’t in the right frame of mind I didn’t want to talk about it. If anybody asked how I was doing at this time I was doing fine, that was it, don’t want to talk about it, how are you? Move on. I didn’t want to talk about it, I didn’t want help, I didn’t want comfort, I just wanted to know they were there, like before to have wine and a laugh with. I had to learn that these are the people who know you best, talk to them, tell them what is going on.,Going to a counsellor is great for the third-party unassociated point of view, however your friends can have insights into you, your history, your personality. I just needed to know that they were there, whether I needed a laugh, a cry, a hug or a beer … or seven. For me, that was plenty. I’m often telling friends who have other friends with Depression that you cannot constantly ask how they are, how they’re feeling or give suggestions on how to feel better, constantly try to be chirpy because you think it will help – it doesn’t, it just annoys us.,I think it is important that if your friend tells you they are suffering from Depression you should ask them just to tell you what they need from you and you will be there. These communication lines are incredibly important. As I said above a friend of mine suffered from Depression, we didn’t have these communication lines open, I got so caught up in my life I forgot how it felt to feel so alone in Depression, I didn’t ask what she needed from me, I didn’t forgive her turbulent moods nor did I make myself available, just when she really needed me.,My lessons from this comes down to open communication. You cannot get through any relationship without communication, but it is even more important when the people around you need to understand what you need at any given time. Be honest and don’t be afraid to talk, remember that not every body understands, not through any fault of their own, but because Depression is , to understand., "
,"Having a mental health problem makes life complicated. For me, a teenage girl, going to boarding school, living with 7 other girls in a room, life seemed impossible, but it wasn’t just that: life always seemed impossible, at home, at school, wherever I was. There wasn’t exactly a lot of privacy with my mental health problem. When you live with your friends, your deterioration isn’t something that is easy to hide. It’s hard to explain why you have been crying for an hour and half, and why the very thought of getting up in the morning makes it hard to breathe. I was lost in my own skin, searching for some way to escape the sadness, running back and forth, in a pitch black maze, looking for an exit that didn’t seem to exist. Though, however impossible life seemed, my friends seemed to make it a little bit more possible.,It wasn’t just the big things that people did that would help. Sometimes, just a text saying “I hope you’re okay” or “I’m here if you need” was enough to give me the motivation to smile again, even just for a moment. People often underestimate the power of talking, but also just listening. A rant to a friend was occasionally the best thing for me. They didn’t belittle my problems or tell me to get over it. When I talked, I didn’t always need advice, or a solution, I just needed a friend to listen.,But above all, what made it the most bearable were the talks about trivial things. Whether it was gossiping on a group chat with friends, or talking about what’s been in the news or my favourite TV show, or even just a funny picture that one of us had seen on some social networking site, it helped. The feeling of being completely alone in the world wasn’t screaming quite so loudly in my head. For an hour, I didn’t have to be the one with depression. I just got to be another teenage girl, talking with her friends.,I still have days where I don’t feel like I’m ready to face the world. It’s okay to be alone for a little while, and I don’t question that everyone needs some space sometimes, but isolation is far too easy. It was easy for me to think that I was shutting out the world, and the pain. When I took some time off of school, I thought that I could push out the stress of everything, that I would be in my own world for a while. I had hit rock bottom and I was prepared to stay there. However, sitting at home, watching TV, bathing in my self-pity, I received a phone call from my friends at school, telling me cheesy jokes. Another friend texted me, almost constantly, while I was off school. I do not have any doubt that their support was what allowed me to return to school within two weeks.,Through my time experiencing a mental health problem, I haven’t always been openly thankful, or appreciative for the support of my friends. I’ve worked hard, in some cases, to push away those who seemed to care the most. However, my friends gave me the time, and space, to talk when I was ready. The road hasn’t been easy, not for me, and I know, not for them, but I am so thankful that they haven’t left me.,I’m not under any impression that my friends can change that I have a mental health problem. I’m not under any impression that a day out with friends will “fix” me or change my view of life completely. They may not have been able to lead me out the maze I was so lost in, but they gave me some light in the darkness, even just for a couple of hours. They managed to keep me company in my pain. I’m still experiencing that pain but in my darkest moments, and my hardest days, it’s always so nice to remember that I have friends, just a text away.,I hope, with this blog, to possibly inspire one person to text a friend, to call a friend, to invite a friend out, to ask how are you and be prepared for the “actually, I’m not okay”. I hope I have shown the importance of friends in my life, and hopefully in all of our lives. So please, make yourself known to your friends. Let them know you are there to listen, to care, to not judge. Whether you go for a walk, go out for a meal, talk over a cup of tea or just send a quick text, do not ever underestimate your power to help. The people around you experiencing a mental health problem aren’t asking you to be their therapist. They just need a friend."
," ,Hello. I’m Harvey. I have liver disease. I have Crohn’s Disease. I have Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. I also have Depression. Not a lot of people know that; that I have depression. They know about the other things. Because I tell them. If I’m out, and they see I’m not drinking alcohol, I tell them about my Liver Disease. If I am having a flare-up and am running off to the toilet every hour, I tell them about my Crohn’s Disease. If I go from crackerjack to walking dead in a matter of minutes, I tell them about the chronic fatigue.,Should they ask if there’s something wrong with me, and I mean , wrong with me, I just say I’m having a bad day. I do this because, for me, it just isn’t worth the hassle of explaining depression to someone who doesn’t have it. It isn’t just the physical reaction of them going “oh”, and then struggling to ask what they think is the right question, it is the emotional task of opening oneself up to the critique of someone who probably knows little about it; it’s never an easy conversation. This is perhaps the eternal plague of depression – it is so painful, so impossible to imagine and to explain, that anyone who doesn’t have it must, by default, be utterly unaware of what it is and, more succinctly, what it does to you.,Hello. I’m Harvey. And I’m having a bad day.,But I’m not really. I am having a terrible day. In fact I’m having a terrible week, a terrible month, a terrible year.,See, that makes you uncomfortable, doesn’t it; hearing that my life is terrible. Given the option, you would choose against hearing it. Suddenly you have been burdened with information that cannot be unheard or miscommunicated. And you’ll never see me in the same way again. That’s why I don’t tell people I have depression. It is unfair on them. One person having a bad day is enough, even if the second was kind enough to ask. I don’t enjoy the idea that I am putting my difficulties (and such profound ones) onto the shoulders of others, in spite of the fact that they’re probably willing and able to take some of the weight off of my own.,Hi. I’m Harvey. I’m just having a really bad day.,Something unexplainable went wrong. Nobody should feel this alone. Nobody deserves this level of loss, this anguish, this unfaltering state of defeat, this spinelessness, this worry. This cocktail of misery that is force-fed to you by your brain, the very tool designed to keep you alive, and you drown in it very quickly, floundering in this ocean of agony, hands vainly grasping for the remaining shreds of your humanity that your mind contrives to keep out of reach.,And they have the audacity to tell me that sometimes, everyone feels like I feel now. ,And to them I wish I could say, “Not like this, they don’t. This is an infection"". It tells me that there is no point in living. My day only truly begins when I am left alone with my thoughts. That’s when the battle starts. And it is one minor battle in a life-long war; a war that, if lost, will take from me my right to live.,But I keep quiet. I say something completely different, trivial or mundane.,Hi. I’m Harvey. Don’t worry about me. I’m just having a bad day.,I have spoken to friends (and family) who regard depression with scepticism and cynicism, who genuinely think that it is self-indulgence with a scary name. At first, I hate them for saying these things – they often don’t know they’re talking to someone who can vouch for its undoubted existence and its destructive power. Then I have to take a step back and realise that, to someone who doesn’t know… to someone who , know, sorry, it must very much seem like self-indulgence. The same can be said of other diseases that have not been diagnosed. Appendicitis can be described as ‘cramp’, migraine can start off as ‘headache’, even some cancers can make their presence known by causing its sufferer to vomit or fever, like any run of the mill ‘bug’.,The difference between depression (and many other mental health issues) and other ‘physical’ diseases is that people maintain their critical stance , a diagnosis has been made. For example, I doubt you would say, “Hey, have you tried, like… , having diabetes?” to someone who clearly has diabetes.,I don’t know why people persist in mythologizing depression as a simple sadness so, when people ask if I’m okay I just reply, giving them a safe answer to a safe question.,Hi. I’m Harvey. And I’m having a bad day.,Here’s the thing, though. All I need is for more people to ask, and I’ll be more willing to tell. I think that a major issue with depression is that many people seem adamant that it either does not exist or they feel that it is acceptable to ignore. It is almost beyond taboo. It isn’t feared or spoken of in whispers, it is downright neglected. That’s scary, don’t you think? That people are taking their lives? As a last chance saloon to rid themselves of torment, people willingly kill themselves because, for them, it is easier than continuing to live. While people allow this ‘idea’ of depression to inform their opinions on it, as opposed to embracing the truth of it, this will keep on happening. But there is a simple solution: when you ask someone if they’re okay, mean it. This a situation that could so easily be countered by a caring friend or a culture that supports those experiencing mental health – we need people know it is okay to admit to having a problem and that will not happen while mass opinion dictates that mental health is simply a whinge that went too far.,Hi. I’m Harvey. And I’m having a bad day.,Consider this my personal plea. Don’t allow me to just say this and carry on with my day. I have depression. So do many other people. This is me begging you to do some research. Understand what I face every day. Tell others what you have learnt about depression. It all starts with everyone realising that this isn’t some game. This isn’t angst. This is very real and very dangerous. It’s crushing people, like me, who feel that they cannot speak to anyone about the difficulties they face on a daily basis.,You must understand. When I say “I’m having a bad day”, that’s not what I mean.,I’m keeping a last, secret bit to myself.,Because I’m terrified of how you’ll react.,Hi. I’m Harvey. I’m having a bad day. And I’m crying out for help."
,"Over 10 years ago, I had brain tumour surgery and I was cognitively impaired as a result. It means that I have problems with planning, organising and my memory. I also suffer from fatigue, social isolation, depression and suicidal thoughts.,I was unable to continue with my studies, lost my job and lost my friends because they saw me differently.,Having this mental health problem is worse than being bankrupt, because with the latter society will accept you after 6 years, whereas mental health problems are for life.,If you have a physical health problem, people can see you need help and you can get reasonable adjustment, e.g. a ramp for a person in a wheelchair. But if you have a mental health problem, which is not so obvious to people, they will treat you as a normal person. No reasonable adjustment will be offered, unless you disclose you have mental health problems. This often prevents many people from disclosing their problems as they fear being judged unfavourably.,If there is one thing that has made a difference to me it is finding out about the work placement scheme (Transitional Employment Program (TEP) run by the day centre that I attend. I was so impressed by how the program can help people with mental health problems get back to work, I am writing a book to promote TEP to more employers. I felt TEP gives people a chance to show they can be a valuable member of society thus improving their confidence. At the same time, they can learn new skills and improve their CVs. It is my hope that my book will broaden the help for people who suffer from mental health problems in silence.,Recently I had a very inspiring telephone conversation with a friend named Jo, who I met at an event, which was focusing on self development. Jo is applying the knowledge she learnt from the self development event and developing her public speaking skills. She asked me whether I wanted to do public speaking on mental health stigma and discrimination in the workplace and I replied “Yes”. I was excited by this idea of speaking in front of audiences. (I will come back with an update after my first talk).,She was very positive about this and felt my experience with mental health issues would be a very valuable story to tell. She volunteered to be my accountability buddy to ensure I carry out my speaking practice. Her belief in my ability to do this has been a tremendous boost to my self confidence and self esteem.,I’ve been inspired to speak out about my mental health because of the positive response I received when I disclosed my past history to my colleagues. They were amazed at what I had been through and impressed with the way I have come through it. One of my colleagues remarked that if you hadn't told us about your history, I would just have thought of you as an average guy, may be struggling a little because English is not your first language.,I think it is important to remember that not all reaction from the general public is negative and sharing can have a very positive and uplifting effect.,When I told my friends that I am going to talk about my mental health experience on stage, they said “Wow -good for you. You have a lot to tell. Your story will inspire many people and give them hope. That it is not just a dream, it is achievable. You are a living example.”,I would like to help more people so that they don’t feel they are alone with their troubles. It is rewarding to feel that I am helping other people."
,"Sometime you wonder how low you can go and if you have been at the top of your profession it’s a long way down. A friend of mine was there for me when I felt I had reached that place.,I used to be a Head Teacher, but the ravages of a small school take their toll, especially for a person with anxiety. Can you imagine the variables of disaster that could lurk within a school, staff, pupils, buildings, parents, advisors, dinner ladies? When you have anxiety you try to prevent problems, cross every ‘t’, dot every ‘i’ and pre-empt potential pit falls. Impossible in a school. On the surface I was Mr Congeniality, always calm, in control, pleasant, efficient organised. In my head I was slowly burning out.,One day the smouldering flame extinguished and I fell into the pits of a deep depression. After six months, it was clear that there was no way back to that job, at the grand old age of 45 in the words of the Local Education Authority I was terminated. I didn’t know if I would be eligible for a retirement pension, with five children, a big mortgage and ill health I threw myself at the discretion of the benefits system. Although I had been unable to return to teaching due to my mental health difficulties, I had to have a medical to maintain incapacity benefit system. So there I was sat in the dole office waiting to plea for £87 a week.,I left the dole office feeling low but a friend of mine had arranged to take me for a coffee, he listened to my woes and encouraged me to keep going and not give up. It was great that my friend had arranged this meeting on the same day as I did not know how low I would feel after this appointment. It was helpful being able to chat to somebody who was not a counsellor or a family member, someone who did not have to make a judgment, but just be there as a friend.,This chat was more than just a coffee at the time; it was just at the right time. You may not know the impact or the timing of a small gesture. If I had gone back to an empty house I may have dwelt on the consequences of the day more, but this small action meant I had a distraction and a chance to talk before I burdened my family.,My friend Ernesto met me on several occasions and although sometimes I had to make a big effort to go it was always worth it as bending an ear is a great relief when you feel down. It is heartening to know that people care and are still there for you. The biggest thing I found was that my pride had been hurt and I couldn’t see a way out of the situation, as this friend knew me before my breakdown he was also aware of my achievements and could refer to these. Is it hard to go to work when you are ill, yes, but it is harder when you have no work to go to and you realise that you are not well enough to work, this is when you need a good friend.,On appeal I maintained my benefits and eventually got my pension. A friend was there for me when I needed him most. He could not wave a magic wand but he offered me a hand up when I was down, listened and encouraged. Now I would love to be able to use the life experience I have had to be that friend to people who find themselves heading for a low point hopefully before they arrive there.,Thanks Ernesto."
,"For me, if there were just one person I could confide in there would be one less burden on my shoulders. All it takes is one friend to change someone’s life, change their perspective of people. Friends and family can be supportive at really low periods of mental illnesses. There is no need to suffer in silence. Knowing that someone is there by text or email at just a click of a button can be a lifeline to someone suffering from Depression or any other mental illness.,The past couple of years have been a real struggle for me battling Depression and Anorexia and changing University courses. There has been one friend that I have relied upon for continued support and friendship that has been invaluable. My best friend Melissa has been my rock. She has helped me so much just by emailing a ‘Hey, How are you babe?’. Just a short simple email once a week made me open up and discuss many problems I have faced over the years.,Being able to discuss my feelings with a friend has made me see a different perspective on life, a different perspective I cannot see as sometimes my illnesses distort and skew my perceptions of situations. She has been able to sit with me through the storm and battled against it with me. Her words of encouragement have reassured me I’m loved, I can get through recovery at a pace that suits me and not everyone has a stigmatised attitude to mental illnesses. She hasn’t labelled me crazy or treated me differently but accepted me for who I am and the illnesses I suffer from. That email is the smallest thing that has made a big difference."
,"I have been diagnosed with , since I was 16. It took a little while to have a healthcare professional to actually say the phrase 'depression' .,During this time I was frequently told I was behaving ‘like a stroppy teenager’ and pushed aside. The word 'hormones' and 'angst' and others were always repeated at me but I felt like it was different to what everyone else my age seemed to be doing. This diagnosis pushed me to look at it from an adults perspective and, for the first time, I stopped hurting myself and focussed on it from a different angle, trying to look after myself.,When I was 18 I was finally referred to social services for an assessment after being on an acute low and given was medications to help me.,This was really first time I experienced discrimination. When I was prescribed medication, I struggled with some of the side effects. As a result of this I took a few days sick leave from work. When I returned to my job I was told that because I had ‘failed to declare it’ on my health declaration form, I would be suspended immediately and would receive a disciplinary. To be honest, I was 18 at the time and didn't understand employment policies, and didn't feel like my job was affected, so I was baffled at why they would use this against me. They upheld the disciplinary, and upheld the appeal and eventually my contract was terminated. Or, for a want of a better word, I was sacked from my job.,This is also the first time I met someone that restored my faith in people. My union representative was brilliant and he refused to let it go. He fought for disability discrimination and the case was settled out of court. I was told the reason for this was because the organisation were worried about any media attention that would occur and I wanted it to end, so I agreed to this and put it behind me.,I continued to struggle with depression, sometimes so severely I felt like I couldn't cope with day to day menial tasks. I told myself I wasn't going to let it beat me despite my mind shouting at me to quit, but I carried on; I always forced myself to work full time and push forward. Its conflicting having ambition when you don’t want to get out of bed! Usually resulting in daily arguments with myself but somehow, I struggled along.,Long story short, one thing that has followed me ever since my diagnoses was the stigma and the ignorance surrounding mental health.,This just one case of discrimination I have met over the years. I have, in the past, been told by a GP to 'get over it', a manager has said to me that she would 'never have given me the job if she'd have known' (despite my work being of a higher quality than what was required of me). I have lost friends, been belittled by others, called names, been accused of lying, and been told I'm overreacting. I've been told I 'need to snap out of it', and heard phrases like 'It's not like I can see what's wrong with you' so many times, I have lost count. I want to ,, which is more common than some people realise.,I want to reiterate that my experiences have not all been negative; far from it. I have received support from health care professionals, friends and family and work colleagues. Their support allow me to have faith in people. I think when people are going through a tough time then it's not sympathy that they want but just a basic understanding that, sometimes, they may need support. Support doesn’t have to be in the form of a shoulder to cry on but an acknowledgement that what they are experiencing does not make them 'crazy', it just makes them human."
,"Clear, bright, calm – that’s the river and the weather in this photo, and the opposite of how I’d been feeling in the days before I took it.,It was October 2011 and I was off work with depression. A stressful couple of months had slowly, sneakily reversed the progress I’d made since having counselling for my first bout of the illness. One night it came back with a vengeance.,My brain felt so full that it might explode. I was angry, confused, miserable and shattered. This mental turbulence kept me awake at night and my tired brain couldn’t cope during the day – a cruel and exhausting cycle that trapped me in darkness.,I vowed to myself that I would get out of the house every day and go for a walk, partly to get some exercise and fresh air and partly for a change of scenery that might distract me from the cyclone in my brain. My dad must have recognised this was what I needed too, because he arranged to take me out for a hearty walk by a canal out in, the countryside.,Looking back on that outing, there were a number of small things that helped me.,It was in a place I didn’t know, so there was a sense of exploration and discovery – a new experience and the best kind of distraction.,It was a bright, sunny autumn day – one of those crisp, cool days that makes you want to take deep breaths, which helps you relax and appreciate what’s around you. ,Being a keen birdwatcher I had taken my binoculars, and remember some of the birds I saw that day, and where I saw them. As we got out of the car, there was a great-spotted woodpecker that flew from a tree and landed on a telegraph pole a few yards away. Further along the walk, near the river, we saw a sparrowhawk zipping low along a line of bushes. And we saw fieldfares, which had arrived from Scandinavia for the winter.,My memories of that autumn are otherwise pretty murky, but these images are crystal clear in my mind even now. I think that shows the value of trying to do something you enjoy, however small, if you can muster the energy.,The fact my dad had organised the day helped too. I didn’t have to think – just take it in. And the company certainly helped. Being able to talk to someone you trust and who understands you is so important, and the different setting took me away from my problems somehow, and gave me a boost that defied my weariness.,There’s a reason holidays are marketed as a chance to ‘get away from it all’. It’s because that chance is something we all need and crave. This walk wasn’t a holiday, of course, but the change and escape was what I really needed."
,"Initially I kept my depression secret, with only close family members knowing. I thought it was something I should be ashamed of and I blame the stigma around mental health for this. However, I am now proud to say I have depression and social anxiety because I know the troubles I have had on my journey to get where I am, yet I have still got here with mental health issues. I hope to inspire others with mental health to get out of the dark and be proud, since being honest my life has been much better.,Talking about mental health is something that is very hard for both the speaker and the listener. Awkwardness over comes faces, people don’t know how to react, sometimes people even look at me like I could be contagious. I think it is time people started to wake up to the concept of mental illness and realise the effect it has on people. I have felt ashamed of who I am for too long.,A core reason I believe that I felt ashamed is the way that people use mental health as a way to describe something as bad. I cannot count the times I have heard people say 'They’re just mad' or 'they're acting mental'. Depression is also used as something that can easily be cured, ‘don’t look so depressed’ etc. Recently I had a very restless night contemplating how I could ‘not be so depressed’. It resulted in me not taking my medication and trying to be ‘normal’. But what is normal? I like to think that I am more normal than people who say these comments that have such a lasting effect.,Having social anxiety means that it is very difficult to make and keep friends. Often I have been called rude because sometimes I am quiet. I am seen as ignorant and stuck up because I don't always want to go out or dance in front of lots of people. Worst of all people have said that I am weird because I struggle to make eye contact with people. The question I have to all of these people though is, am I the rude one? My illness makes social situations unbelievably hard, sometimes I have panic attacks all day before a big event. So does it make me rude to want to sit and be quiet or perhaps leave early? Or does it not make me brave for going in the first place. I ask people to think before they speak in future, perhaps the person leaving early has a reason. On the other hand, I am now very lucky, I have an excellent group of friends who are very supportive of me, although it has been a very long and painful journey to get here!,I really hope that, one day, the world can be open enough to mental health so as not to shy away from people when they speak about their issues with mental health. I no longer want to have the awful look you get when you mention mental health. Even though to you it might not seem much, try to think before you call someone mad or mental in the future, it could mean a lot to them."
,"Recently I sat on the sofa with my mother. My head hung, and one solitary bubble drifted around the surface of my cup of tea, slowly meandering in one direction, then another, searching for something; dancing a peculiar waltz. My mother asked me how I was feeling; she looked for the bubble but it was cowering on the edge of the mug out of her view, and then it popped. At that moment the whole world was in my mug of tea, and I, the lonely bubble, had burst. It was this bubble in my mug, resting on the warm comfort beneath, which awoke my senses if only for a second, and, like a mirror, reflected my perpetual loneliness and confusion.,My family now know about my anxiety and depression. It has been accumulating like a tidal wave since my early teens and now, as a 20 year old, I have finally plucked up the courage to seek professional help. But it was far from easy.,I had thought that if I hid behind messy hair and hairy legs and disguised myself as a traveller, my problems would all dissolve. The truth is I had packed my depression in my rucksack when I got on the plane to travel after finishing sixth form, and it followed me all the way to the other side of the world. The further I ran the faster it raced to catch up with me, until a year later my body and mind began to shut down and I booked a flight straight home. It took another two months before I was able to tell the people around me that there has been something seriously wrong for many years.,In the following weeks I suffered persistent panic attacks that felt like tattoos to my bones, nearly took my own life, and the only three words that my brain allowed space for were ‘It’s too late’.,I am now having home visits and accepting the help I so adamantly refused during college because I was determined not to accept that I had an ‘illness’: I had truly believed that depression was part of my character and in seeking help, my individuality would somehow have been stolen. I spent a long time in denial because depression and anxiety had been a part of me for so long that I was afraid to even attempt to let them go. Looking back through my college diary entries I see a frightened, lonely, confused and bitter girl in a vicious cycle of self-destruction and inner turmoil. My depression itself prevented me from seeking the help that I needed, and I allowed no one close enough to me to discover how troubled I really was.,I’d spent a large proportion of my life on the edge of a cliff, dangling from an unravelling rope, falling into holes and tunnelling out of them, hoping that one day I could wander off the edge of the earth unnoticed. Throughout college I became increasingly confused, deciding that the world wanted me to fail. My diaries, which had been my method of venting negative thoughts and emotions since I was twelve, became scattered and illogical, and relationships with the people around me slowly deteriorated until I had retreated so far into myself that nobody knew who I was anymore.,I find overcoming depression rather like learning to ride a bicycle. When you’re faced with the vehicle for the first time you cannot even fathom attempting to sit on it and pedal, and yet you see people around you cycling with ease. You finally decide to try, and inevitably you fall off. You’re frustrated, jealous of the people who ride one-handed beside you, and you feel like giving up.,When we finally do learn however, we often look back at those memories of bruised limbs and sweaty palms on handlebars, and they become comparatively insignificant yet simultaneously crucial. Battling depression is not an easy ride. One day, however, no matter how impossible it may seem to someone suffering from depression, I believe we all have the ability to find the strength within us to persevere in learning to ride our own bicycles, glancing back every now and then at where we’ve been, only to discover how far we’ve come.,My aim is to share my experiences and encourage others not to be afraid of mental illness like I was. For those of us who know what it feels like to live underneath a boulder that just keeps getting heavier, or to run with a broken leg, we shouldn’t feel ashamed. Depression and anxiety are potentially life threatening illnesses and the more we share our understanding the more we can battle the stigma, spread awareness and encourage each other to take the first steps to recovery, however tough they may seem."
,"I have , and ,. I have had suicidal thoughts for the past year and I self-harm. But I am still here.,At the moment, I am struggling. Words simply cannot describe the intense pain, despair and hopelessness I feel during these periods of 'darkness' - like I'm screaming on the inside and fighting for every breath. I become a paradox - unable to think clearly yet acutely aware of every thought, restless yet paralyzing tired, desperate to be alone but hoping someone will talk to me, not wanting to live another day but terrified of death...,It's hard, really hard. The one thing I'm finding harder than anything though is the stigma, ignorance and frustration being lobbed at me from certain people who are supposed to be my friends. A year ago I was in a similar state - surrounded by darkness and unable to see an end to my suffering that didn't involve suicide. I had a friend who supported me and held my hand and believed in my future even though I insisted there wasn't one.,Today that same friend ignores my texts and blames me for my illness. I'm told that if I wanted to get better and change I would; that only I have the power to change how I feel and improve my life; that there is no point talking to her because there's nothing she can do to help. I feel sad - firstly because her words imply depression is a choice and I am choosing to stay unhappy and secondly because it feels like a huge rejection.,Though I have made a conscious effort to try and avoid talking to her about how I feel, at my worst the words just come tumbling out. I admit to self-harming and not wanting to live and feeling alone. Each time I am filled with remorse because I am so ashamed at having to admit even after a year of therapies and medications I am not better yet. I also hate worrying people or putting them in an awkward or uncomfortable position. I have apologized time and time again for both these things, even though I know it isn't my fault and that I am ill. But essentially I am frightened and desperate for somebody to listen to me - I don't know where to turn to or what to do next and I miss having the support and compassion they showed a year ago. The hardest part is that I have few others to turn to.,I wanted to write this blog for anyone who is struggling to deal with a friend or relative with mental health issues. We know you don't have the answers and you can't make it better. We aren't asking for help in the form of an action plan or solutions. We don't care about you saying the wrong thing or not saying anything. Honestly, we just want someone to listen when we need to talk and to not judge when we mess up. Just be there for them when they need you. I know it must be so frustrating to see them suffer,but we need you, really we do.,Fortunately I do have another person to turn to at the moment who is beyond kind, patient and understanding, and for that I am thankful. So I keep on living and keep trying to recover. One day depression will let me go, and I will be a far more compassionate and empathetic person because of it.,A poem to end - a response to anyone who trivializes or underestimates how difficult it is to live with severe depression:,Your words,
Were darts laced with cyanide,
Their target my poison riddled mind,Your words,
Were the sharpest of knives,
Cutting into my already scarred skin,Your words,
Were the strongest of punches,
Shattering my already broken heart,Your words,
Crept into my muscles,
Causing them to cramp and ache,Your words,
Managed to extinguish,
The only light in the darkest of caves,Your words,
Were just words,
Not meant to hurt me, but,Your words,
Were unbearably painful,
And they refuse to stop haunting me."
,"Over the past four years I have been living with a wide range of mental health problems, this is my journey so far.,After a serious feud with a close family member, many difficult emotions and consequences followed these events, I began to feel lost, angry and isolated, constantly overcome by these emotions I attempted to end my life.,Soon after that suicide attempt, my doctor diagnosed me with depression. My first response was shock: ,An invisible brick wall of despair would hit me on my path each and every day, affecting my confidence and attitude in life. I became completely detached from pals and relatives. I was in denial. I would not speak about my depression instead I would hide it and wear an invisible mask; pretending I was okay when in fact I was ready to explode like a rocket of emotion.,I chose not to tell my family including my mum. I simply didn’t want to worry them. They knew something wasn’t quite right and yes, they did know about that suicide attempt and about my panic attacks. However, after time I learnt to ,Hiding my depression away from my mum was incredibly tough, I just wanted them not to worry. People say I’m funny and kind, I just wanted to stay like that, so putting on that act was my only coping strategy.,Overtime I was able to talk to youth workers about simply how I was. I spoke to them about my thoughts and feelings, having weekly chats with someone who listens and talking about my depression. Having a youth worker was brilliant!,As I grew up, and my 18, birthday arrived, I officially became a , grown up and moved from child mental health services and into adult mental health services, back on the waiting list to be seen by the team.,I had an assessment with a cognitive behavioural therapist and spoke to her about my anxieties and nervousness about going out with pals, busy environments, and loud noises. Due to that sickening feeling of unease I was diagnosed with social anxiety disorder. I suppose this did make sense, I was quite relieved to have that diagnosis and, after a few sessions, I applied to University and to live away from home, leaving CBT behind.,When I was moving to University for my first year, I decided I wouldn’t tell anyone about my mental health. I felt that keeping it a secret was the only option. With no professional support in place, it was a real struggle but I passed my first year and headed home.,Due to a distressing situation in the middle of the summer break I had to finally tell my mum, with the help of my auntie (she’s like a big sister), and I have to say, it was the best decision I have ever made. I felt I could be honest about my experiences, my scars, thoughts and all the support I had accessed. My mum is great so I didn’t have a clue why I was so scared but I told her and it was a fantastic decision.,I was later referred for psychological counselling through talking therapy, speaking about the root of my depression and anxiety. I realised this came from my extremely difficult childhood and teenage experiences with a close relative. My therapist diagnosed me with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. I was in total disbelief. However, my therapist explained how we would address this – through exposure therapy. The therapist was lovely too, which made the support enjoyable, there was no pressure, it was just my time to kind of help myself.,After just eight sessions over the summer just gone, it was time to head back to University for my second year and to leave home for the second time. This was extremely daunting. I was determined to make this work though and all I wanted was to carry on with my passion, to make art, which is one thing that keeps me positive and in control. I am currently on the waiting list with Mental Health Community Team, with an assessment booked.,I decided this time to be open with my friends and tutors at University; everyone has been so supportive and helpful. Telling my mum, friends and tutors about my mental health has been one of the best decisions I have ever made.,I would really suggest being open and honest is the best way. It may be scary but being truthful is the best way to become comfortable. I no longer feel ashamed about my mental health, I would just like to help others!"
,"I am a self employed artist doing exhibitions, conventions and Freshers’ fairs. I also suffer from pretty intense mental distress. Talking to my peers has been very valuable because they gave me support that I was unable to get from secondary services. I needed someone to talk to and services do not always have the time for this.,My friends often understand when I talk about social anxiety and depression as most people have some experience with this, but they can’t relate to the strange sensory hallucinations I get. However, they are still willing, for the most part, to discuss it and this does help me. I know it's hard for them to get but they accept that it's real to me.,This afternoon, I took part in the final rehearsal for a gig and during this my vision sharpened, brightened, I started to sweat, people’s faces start to distort, I felt like running away, I couldn't bear to be there. I started to have paranoid feelings. I talked it through with one of my peers, so we went to a quiet nearby café and he sat with me, we had a cup of tea. I explained that when you’re in a massive panic attack it feels like it'll never end. I stayed in it, talked it through a bit and I was able to get home safely.,I wrote this blog because I think we can all relate to times we felt vulnerable, judged, unsafe, or down. I think the more we share experiences the more we realise there is more unites us than divides us, as I discovered this afternoon."
,"I once saw a documentary about how crocodiles hunt for their prey – they grab their victim and drown them before tearing their limbs off and eating them piece by piece.,For me, a crocodile’s hunting technique provides a perfect analogy for what , is like. I have been known to smoothly swim through the waters of my life and suddenly been caught by depression. It rises through the water without any warning, grabs me with its vicious teeth and strong jaw before drowning and tearing me apart.,Those closest to me (and the bravest) have asked me what it's like to suffer from a depressive episode.,I tell them it’s waking up in the morning and being disappointed that I have made it through the night; hating that yet another day stretches before me, believing that I am, at my core, absolutely and completely unlovable, that I am worthless and pointless.,It's feeling that I don’t want to continue to live anymore, that it’s not something that can be ""fixed"" by a fun night out, or a new dress. It is an all-encompassing experience that makes me feel utterly debilitated. During these periods leaving my house is almost impossible and on my worst days making a cup of tea is too large a feat. I am so exhausted that I spend my time lying on my bed.,There is another side to my experience though. When I am feeling better, I know that I have been blessed with wonderful friends… I think about my best friend who I have known since university – the girl who has never judged me. I remember how, at my lowest ebb, she gave up her Saturdays to cook for me and clean my home so that even if I wasn’t able to go out of the house, at least it was a nice place to be. I remember how she bossily refused to allow me to order yet more junk food and insisted that I ate something with a small amount of nutritional value and how she has sat with me through various doctors’ appointments.,There are other friends too, those that know that, sometimes, what I am feeling is so awful it cannot be verbalised, they choose to say a thousand words by putting an arm around me. There are those that know to let me be until I am able to emerge from my hiding place but will never question why.,There is no doubt about it, depression is a cruel condition that is made worse by its stigma and the by the fact that it cannot be seen in the way other illnesses can be. Talking about it and being honest will help. I have shared my experiences because I hope in a small way it goes towards understanding what I, and thousands of others, battle."

An , is portrayed as a desire to be the thinnest person in the world for vanity purposes.,It's ridiculous how far removed from the truth that is. In actual fact it has very little to do with body image and much more to do with emotional control and distress. I've had my illness for a long time and I've experienced many waves of the disorder. I suffer from , and , in relation to my eating disorder and it is suspected that I also have borderline personality disorder too.,My eating disorder has damaged my life immensely. It has caused relationships to come crashing down around me and I've had to leave jobs as I was too weak to even climb the stairs. I was often told I was being selfish or that it was self inflicted behaviour and that all I needed to do was eat. When it comes down to it there is an element of truth to the 'just eat' thing. However it wasn't that simple for me.,Food was like poison to me. It resembled all the negativity in my life. It made me feel weighed down by impurity, dirtiness, ugliness and selfishness. My body shape made me miserable and I spent all day everyday thinking about how great life would be if I was skinny. The problem was that I was never skinny. Not in my head at least.,I was on death’s door with my skeleton on show and I still wasn't skinny in my mind. It was a path of self destruction. My self esteem and self worth all tangled up in the idea of being the ideal woman, ultimately the ideal woman in my head was a corpse, only I couldn't see it that way.,People would tell me that I looked great as the weight dropped off but they didn't have a clue about the thoughts in my head. I lost 10 years of my life. Everywhere I went and everything I did- I wasn't really there at all. My body was there but my head was wrapped up in when I next had to eat and how I could get rid of it so I got thinner. It went on for years. The anger and anxiety around food and being social got out of hand and I shied away from the world. Nobody understood. I lost friends. People abandoned and gave up on me. They thought I was a loner, a freak, a weirdo, a chore and an inconvenience.,I fought my way into recovery with help and treatment from professionals. I relapsed a fair few times. Now I'm on the up though and I will not let anyone bring me down. The ones who love me stood by me and those who left me were naïve and uneducated on mental health and the seriousness of it. Today I am in recovery from my eating disorder and I'm looking to the future.,I hope one day people will see that negative comments and misunderstanding of mental health causes more damage to people living with mental health problems. Having a mental illness doesn't make me weak or any less of a woman than anybody else. If anything I feel my illness has taught me to be understanding, empathic, considerate and open minded."
,"What if. Two words that probably have little or no meaning to most but, to me, they form the basis of my anxiety. What if something happens? What if I am ill? What if that was the last time I see that person? What if, what if, what if.,My fears are irrational but when my anxiety takes hold the questions consume my thoughts, I become paralysed with fear and spiral into depression. I feel trapped, like I am lost in an extremely large world with no way out.,My confidence vanishes, I feel on edge and the stress triggers panic attacks. During my worst moments the only place I feel safe is at home, meaning daily tasks, days out, eating out and holidays are almost impossible to face. My relationship with food suffers too. I link food to illness, so during heightened anxiety I only eat ‘safe’ foods. I once went on holiday to Italy, staying in a 4* hotel, but was awake at 3am each night eating cereal bars – in my mind no other food was safe. Crazy, isn’t it?,I have phobic anxiety and anxiety disorder. The problem with this type of illness, or any mental health issue, is that there is no outward sign to those around you to signal just how badly you are suffering. In addition, the treatment isn’t as simple as putting a plaster over the wound. The hardest part of my anxiety is the fact that I don’t understand it. I struggled for years to put into words how I felt, or to know where to begin to explain.,I realise now that mental illness doesn’t just affect the person with lived experience; it affects everyone close to them too. My anxiety has tested the strongest of relationships, and also broken the weakest. My friends at school somehow accepted me for who I was, and it didn’t matter how much of the school day I missed, or what social events I bailed on, I would always just slot back in. They never questioned my absence, they just accepted it.,One of my friends was my rock during the latter years of school, college and uni. We have grown apart slightly now, but she was never judgemental and offered me support at some of my lowest ebbs. To this day she probably has no idea how much her actions meant to me, and no words would ever be enough to thank her.,Teachers played an important role too. From the ones who just nodded when I needed to leave the class, to the ones who asked if I was OK quietly after the lesson, or the ones who would stay after school and plan with me how I would get through the next school day. It was these times when you knew you weren’t alone. I wasn’t understood, but I wasn’t alone.,Newer friends wouldn't want to know, that was my thinking. My anxiety returned in my final year of uni and I found it easier to move out of my uni house and back home rather than subject them to my behaviour. I thought panic attacks and isolating myself just made me a burden, and it wasn't their place to pander to it. It meant I missed important social events, but at the same time they were impossible for me to face. To them it probably looked like I didn’t care, but this couldn’t have been further from the truth. I have huge sadness over this.,The strength of the relationship between my parents and I was the one that was always tested. We came through stronger each time, and we are incredibly close now, but to this day it makes me sad to think of the anguish my anxiety has put them through. They couldn’t comprehend the irrationality of my fears, but they tried desperately to understand, and I can only imagine how heartbreaking it must have been for them. It was their comments that struck a chord with me though, and made me realise that the only person who could help me, was me. So, at 17 years old, I asked for their help in arranging for me to see a counsellor. I had seen various people before, but somehow I felt in a position to face up to my fears. I needed someone impartial to talk to, someone who wasn’t in a position to judge. Asking for help was the scariest thing I have done, it was admitting I had a problem but, in time, I opened up and talking saved my life.,My 'illness' comes in waves, I wouldn't feel like this all the time. I have been in a period of calm for 3 years now. Don't get me wrong, there are times that I can feel it creeping back in but, over time, I have learnt how to dismiss the 'what if's'. I still don’t feel strong enough to travel the world, which I would love to do, but I hope one day I’ll get there.,I have learnt a lot in my journey; never be afraid to ask for, or to accept, any help. It isn’t a sign of weakness; it is a sign of courage and a small step in a long road to recovery. The second, to realise that no matter what battle you face, or how frightened you might be, there are always people who can help. I owe my recovery to everyone who listened, accepted and supported me and to them I will be forever grateful."
,"I am the 1 in 4. I am one of the ,. It seems like a shockingly high number doesn’t it?,When statistics come out for other illnesses, such as cancer or type 2 diabetes, no-one bats an eyelid, because we all know someone who has been affected by these; often someone that we number among our nearest and dearest.,But mental health problems? For many, they are things that happen to other people. There is still such a stigma in our society that people don’t feel comfortable ,.,Look around at your friends, family, neighbours, colleagues. On average, 1 in 4 will have or have had some issue with their mental health, but we never hear about most of them because people are too ashamed or embarrassed to “come out” as mentally ill.,I have struggled with severe , on and off for over four years. Within that period there have been good times and there have been bad times. I honestly don’t think I would still be here today without the support of the people around me. And yet, most people I know have no idea I am depressed and I wouldn’t dream of talking to them about it.,For the sake of contrast, I am also a type 1 diabetic. My family all know this, my friends all know this, and many colleagues and acquaintances do too. I am very open with my diabetes and happy to talk about it.,So, why the difference? These are both long term, chronic conditions that affect my everyday life. The fact is that I don't fear judgement for my diabetes. When I tell people I am depressed, I worry that they are thinking I am weak or pathetic. That I am using it as an excuse. Even that I am a danger to myself.,I worry that people will look at me and treat me differently. That blossoming friendships or relationships may flounder because I have too much emotional baggage. And the saddest part is that these are not just paranoid concerns. These are real reactions that I have had from real people.,So why I am I putting this out there for the whole internet to read if I am so scared of how people will react? Because this is not how it should be.,I don’t believe that people that react this way are bad people, or are trying to hurt me. A lot of people simply don’t how to respond because it’s a new experience for them. They are wary, thanks to , of those with a mental illness as either dangerous, pathetic, or trying to beat the system. They are scared of the unknown. It doesn't have to be this way. People need to know about mental illness, how to talk about it, and how to support those affected. We can change and save lives. It’s Time to Talk."
,"Depression is a word I hear thrown around day-in and day-out nowadays, how is it possible for a word to be so overly used, yet still hold so much stigma and discrimination for its sufferers?,My experience of , started over 10 years ago when I was 13 years old, I believe that is was my parents’ divorce that triggered an illness that I haven't been able to completely shake ever since.,Any efforts to discuss my mental health (with family, friends and GPs) were greeted with disbelief, shock, horror, shouting, screaming, being told that I should 'snap out of it' and that I was 'attention seeking'.,I'm sure that other people who have suffered from a mental illness will sadly have heard these and many other equally cutting and unhelpful comments at some point in their life.,When I was 18 my mental health once again took a turn for the worse, I could feel myself being dragged deeper into the bleak, cold, black hole that is depression. What followed was undoubtedly the worst experience of my life and I hit my lowest low.,I didn't eat, I barely slept, I struggled to keep up with my college work, I became distant from my friends and family, I was harming myself regularly, I was experiencing extreme anxiety and having heart palpitations and panic attacks and I was thinking about suicide. However, I was still trying to put a brave face on as I was terrified of anyone finding out and telling me what everyone else had done before: that I was stupid, attention seeking and that there was nothing wrong with me.,I eventually plucked up the courage to go and ,, this turned out to be a huge mistake. The questionnaire he administered stated that I was suffering from severe depression. I was not surprised by this diagnosis and even began to feel relieved that my problem eventually had a name. However, the GP had other ideas. 'I don't believe you have severe depression' he said, 'if you did, you wouldn't have been able to smile at me when I greeted you, you wouldn't have been able to get yourself here and you would have lost large amounts of weight'.,I sat there in absolute disbelief. My reply was to say that greeting him with a smile was simply because I was well mannered and had become very good at hiding my deep despair from others, that it has literally taken me years to bring myself to the GP and, finally, that I had in fact lost a lot of weight in the past four months. To this he replied 'well I’m not sure what you've come here for, I'm not going to just give you pills. I don't believe in prescribing anti-depressants to children (I was 19 at the time) and a lot of people come claiming to have depression just to get some time off work or college'.,I nearly burst into tears. I calmly replied that all I wanted was for someone to understand what I was going through and to tell me that there was something wrong with me and give me some advice on how to deal with it. He basically just told me to visit a website about Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) and sent me on my way. I couldn't believe that a health professional had treated me in such a callous and frankly cruel way.,It took another three years before I got up the courage to try the GP again (a different GP this time, obviously!). Finally I found someone who understood, he quickly diagnosed me as having recurrent depressive disorder with anxiety. He prescribed me anti-depressants, which I refused at first but, after some gentle cajoling and logical discussion, I agreed to try. Currently I have never felt better, my illness is being well managed by the correct medication, a healthy lifestyle, an in-depth understanding of my illness and a wonderful support network of my boyfriend, family and friends who are non-judgmental and accept me as I am, even during my bad periods.,Ending the discrimination, stigma and misunderstanding of mental health is so incredibly vital as it is exactly this stigma that prevented me from receiving the right help, support and treatment long ago. I can't help but feel annoyed that I suffered needlessly for so many years and it pains me to think that others are also going through this. It's time to end the stigma and discrimination and to educate people, it's time to talk, it’s time to change."
," “Severe despondency and dejection”, “Hollow; low spirits”,The dictionary presents us with many definitions, but they’re all just letters, letters on a page that barely even scratch the surface.,is like living with lungs that only have the capacity to take in poisonous air. Waking up in the morning with what feels like a clamp inside your chest. Just as the wheels of a car get clamped, those which enable its movement, motivation, and meaning, depression clamps the wheels of a person’s sense of self.,The mind is such a powerful thing. But unlike a broken leg or fractured wrist, we can’t put a plaster on it. When cracks appear in the mind, the outside world is blind. But does that mean that mental illness is any less harrowing or debilitating? Absolutely not. Of course, it is harder to understand, which makes it even more isolating for the person suffering and indeed those watching.,In a room full of people there is a man with a broken leg and a girl with major depression. The man whose leg is in plaster is greeted with endless ‘get well soon’ wishes, and hugs of concern. The young girl is sitting on her own at a table, watching the world go by from behind the transparent screen she is trapped behind. They are both in pain. But only one of them is invisible.,""Pull yourself together"", ""just snap out of it"", ""think positively"". Things I have heard endless times. But would you make the same remarks to a patient with cancer? Of course it’s immensely tragic to watch your daughter, girlfriend or best friend crying their heart out. But what doesn’t work is suggesting they have control of these feelings, that they have a choice. It’s out of their hands. And saying otherwise only causes the sufferer to believe it’s their fault. This amplifies that mentality of worthlessness, which manifests inside the sufferer to lead them down a road of self-loathing. Imagine having a brick wall looming down over your head that physically impairs your movement and won’t let you get up to even try and make things better. That’s what my bad days are like, my days when I’ve fallen off a cliff."
,"I used to be really scared of telling people I suffered with mental health problems.,For years I made excuses for my periods off work, excessive amount of gap years and for not turning up to social events because there would be food there. Keeping a tab on all the different ‘alibis’ was exhausting and I felt isolated and alone with my illnesses.,Having been asked to leave uni and having lost jobs due to my mental health only further cemented the idea that it was something I had to keep secret. I was ashamed to let people see this side of me that I saw as weak and pathetic.,But things have changed. The past 2 years have been the most difficult of my life.,Things with my ,and , got to crisis point and I have spent a good amount of time in treatment. But the last 2 years have also been the most empowering years of my life. I wouldn’t wish mental health problems on my worst enemy but I am a great believer that everything happens for a reason and I think the struggles I have had to face were sent to make me a stronger person. Far from trying to hide my battles I am now proud to say I am beating mental illness.,I am no longer ashamed to admit this huge part of me that has shaped who I am today. Being open with people was hard at first. It took a lot of talking in treatment to get me to the right place mentally to be able to accept my issues let alone admit them to other people. But I have been pleasantly surprised.,Instead of shunning me, a huge majority (there are one or two exceptions) of my friends have reacted in a much more positive way than I had imagined. I find, instead of disdain, most of the people I talk to are intrigued – they don’t know much about mental illness because they are lucky enough never to have it affect their lives – they just want to find out more, how it works, what they can do to help me.,Over eating disorders awareness week for the last two years I have been posting myth-busters on my Facebook statuses in an attempt to raise awareness and get people talking about eating disorders. It worked. Over the course of a week I had over 600 likes on my statuses and numerous comments including many people messaging me to tell me about their own experiences with mental health. One friend even decided to change the programme for her Guide meeting that week after seeing my statuses and played games and did activities to raise the girls’ awareness of eating disorders.,On my recovery journey I have been truly honoured to have met some of the strongest, most inspiring people I have ever found. The other patients who have been in treatment with me have provided me with support, someone to ring when I’m in a panic in Tesco’s not knowing what I should buy for lunch, inspiration in how far they have come fighting their own battles. These amazing friends are not the only good to have come out of my fight against mental illness.,I believe I have become a more compassionate and caring person. I love the feeling of being able to encourage and inspire others. I have realised that although I love teaching, I want to put these new skills and this new passion about mental health to good use and I have begun volunteering with a mental health charity, running sessions at Guide units on issues such as eating disorders, bullying, mental health and communication and I am in the process of applying to go back to uni to study to become a mental health nurse. Yes what has happened to me was (is) hard and terrifying but I still wouldn’t have swapped my life with anyone."
,"We are all subject to variations in moods but it is all too common to confuse feelings of unhappiness for , and, therefore, consider it as something an individual can snap out of by pulling themselves together.,If only it was that simple, I would quite honestly take a few days of unhappiness over how I have felt for the past few months because I have felt unhappiness before and believe me the two are in no way comparable.,Unhappiness is a feeling that can be shaken off, often by putting things into perspective with your loved ones around you, but what if you can’t do this? Depression is no low mood; rather it is a medical condition that transforms your entire outlook on life.,There is so much I used to enjoy and so much I felt like I wanted to achieve but this part of me seems to have disappeared and is nowhere to be found at present. People ask me why. It is so difficult to explain to those that have not suffered with depression themselves as they think there must be a reason, something must have happened to make you feel this way but the truth of the matter is that I cannot explain it myself.,The only way I can attempt to is to ask you to imagine a haze that clouds your mind and consequently your judgment and that leaves you constantly in a state of confusion and despair. Unfortunately, I reacted as many do, and for a while blamed only me. Why am I like this? What’s wrong with me that I can’t just snap out of it? Feeling ashamed and considering depression as a sign of weakness, I put on a pretence. Once I grew tired of this pretence I excluded myself from social situations as much as possible but in doing so, only ended up hurting those I care most about.,Those that know me well would know that this is something I would never intentionally do and if I could go back and just confide in my loved ones, as I should have done from the start, things would have been a great deal easier and I would not have felt as though I was dealing with this alone.,So I urge everyone that is too afraid to speak out to find that courage deep within and openly admit, as I have done, that they suffer with depression and accept the help both medical and from loved ones. It may be difficult but it will all be worth it in the end. Those that truly care about you will stand by and support you and those that don’t, well, quite honestly, they’re the people you’re better off without. With the help that I am now receiving I know that soon I will be feeling a lot better and that life will be worth living again."
,"""You’re the last person I’d expect to be depressed..."",""What have you got to be depressed about?"",""Depression isn't real...it’s an excuse people use for being moody"".,I have heard all of these things said by people I am very close to. One of my closest friends genuinely used to think that depression was a myth,I am the life and soul of every party, the last man standing, always there with a witty one liner. If you need cheering up, I’m your man. I am supremely confident, gregarious and cheerful, a guy who loves to entertain.,I have always realised ,was a very real thing but never for a moment thought I'd call myself ""mentally ill"".,I am married to a wonderful, supportive, beautiful wife. I have two amazing, young, healthy kids. I have a nice house, a decent job, plenty of friends and family.,Three years ago, I walked out on my family. I told my wife I no longer loved her or wanted to be with her, and moved out. I told my three year old daughter I had to leave because if I stayed my head was going to explode. Imagine hearing that when you are three years old! My wife told me not to go. She begged me not to leave my home, her, my three year old daughter and ten month old son. She told me that she thought I was depressed and that she had seen some signs but that they only made sense now. Not one for being told how I feel, or what to do, I abandoned my life, with the only exception being my job.,In the three weeks I was away, I behaved terribly. I drank to excess, hardly ate, ran up a silly amount of debt in a very short space of time, and said awful things to my wife during the conversations (and ultimately blazing arguments) we had.,For some reason I still struggle to understand, my wife agreed to take me back. Naturally, and thankfully, there were conditions. The first was that I seek medical help for what she recognised as depression. The second was that we go for relationship counselling. The third was that if I ever left again there could be no coming back.,I was diagnosed with suffering from depression and anxiety. I was prescribed antidepressants and referred for Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT). The referral took some time to come through. All the while I was trying to repair the damage I had caused with my wife and kids, and my friends and family.,Peoples’ perception of me has changed. On some levels, I think people have some newfound respect for me, but on others people are wary of saying the wrong thing. Or they interpret my moods as always being either symptomatic or asymptomatic, rather than just being.,I have found that telling people helps, but only when I feel the need. There is a stigma attached. I’m a big strapping guy, and to the outside world I am a happy-go-lucky guy who has no reason to be down. When I see articles about attitudes to depression and mental illness I feel like more needs to be done. But I don’t get “offended” by ignorance.,The recent furore over fancy dress costumes in supermarkets seemed, to me, over the top – no offense was intended, it was just people being naive and behind the times. I will still find myself calling friends “nutters”, “crazy” or “lunatic” and I think that’s fine, in the right context. I think that sometimes people get too hung up on being “offended”. I wonder if all of these people are truly upset, or just saying what they think is the right thing. And I think that when the focus shifts to semantics over what terminology we can use as part of our day-today lexicon the point is being missed.,Of course, it’s easier said than done. It is a source of concern for my wife that I seem to have found it easier to spill my thoughts into what I am writing now than to articulate them to her. The reasons for this are hard to explain, but basically I think it’s because I’m emotionally crippled, and my laptop doesn’t ask awkward questions.,The point is, it’s ok to be depressed. Well, actually, it’s not ok, it sucks. But there is no shame in it, people should be able to talk about it openly. I recently changed jobs, and truly had to think twice about declaring my condition. This shouldn’t be the case. So, if you are depressed, spread the word. Don’t be a bore, but don’t hide your darkness under a bushel. A problem shared, as they say...."
,"Before I applied for university to study a MA I was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety and spent time working to realise I was poorly and needed help.,At school I was not the best pupil. I was quiet, often bullied and went home feeling worthless. Over the years my depression got worse and went undiagnosed. I became a self harmer at the age of 12. In my teens I attempted suicide numerous times. Home life was hard. On my last day at school, my best friend and I wrote in each others leaving books. My best friend wrote about how she hoped to see my articles in national newspapers. I, on the other hand, was so low on confidence that I just saw it as a pipe dream. Something I would never do as I had no confidence, just a dream.,I went through college studying courses I was not interested in and just got temp jobs to keep me going financially. I tried to leave home numerous times. However my family had convinced me that we lived in a dangerous world and something bad would happen to me if I didn’t get married and have children at a young age.,I applied for university to study an undergraduate course and slowly started pulling away from home life. During my undergraduate study, I went from being quiet to angry with the world. I eventually left home and lived by myself during my second year of university and then lived in a student house.,I was angry because I was scared of failing university. My feelings of worthlessness came back and I never went out or socialised with other students. I worked to make sure I didn’t fail. At my graduation my best friend was my plus one and my family never showed up. I passed my course with a 2:1 BA Hons.,My sadness that my family didn’t want to come to my graduation was like a black cloud over my head. It followed me everywhere and I kept asking myself and my best friend, ‘what was so wrong with me that my parents could not be happy for me?’ Again I did temp jobs and just scraped by on the money I earned.,I didn’t trust people easily and thought my bosses were just like my parents. I just wanted them to say they were proud of me. I was still self-harming and, when I lost my job in 2012, I hit rock bottom. I broke. I felt like I was sinking and there was this black cloud over me still. I was in a dark room screaming and no one was hearing how much pain I was in.,I learnt that no one could see the thoughts I had in my head telling myself that, it was true all these years, I am worthless. However I was sick of feeling sad. My best friend supported me, though, telling me what I had achieved and asking why was I so focused on the negative? I had to go the doctors and I said that I needed help. I had to use my voice and say: I’m struggling, I need help. This is something that I had never done. I was 29 years old when I was first diagnosed with a mental illness; anxiety and depression.,During my counseling sessions I spoke about my passion for writing and how reading newspapers for hours on end being glued to the news as a child was my escape from what was happening in the family environment. I also spoke about how I just kept journals and wrote poems. It was during my counseling sessions I realised that I did want to be a journalist.,After that counseling session I started to research how I go about taking part in training and courses. I found out that, because I had a 2:1 BA Hons, the next level was a Masters. So I chose to study a Masters in Journalism. I started my Masters in September. Not only that I will be going to university with a mental illness and this time I have coping strategies. I have gone through a range of emotions from scared, nervous, anxious, asking myself: what if I fail? My reply now is that I don’t know until I try! I have a good network of friends and I trust myself. I will give it my best effort on my new course."
,"I have , (BPD), Schizotypal Personality Disorder (StPD), , and Agoraphobia, so a bit of a list there. It’s a struggle knowing where one conditions begins and another ends. I don’t feel like I have a “normal” day and if I have, at any point, a “normal moment” I try and hold on to it for dear life but everything changes so quickly.,I was diagnosed with Depression at 13, BPD at 20, StPD at 23 and Agoraphobia at 26 and one of the biggest problems I’ve found is ,. I find that people become awkward when I mention it and, if they’re not, then I may be feeling paranoid or having delusions or more likely I’m feeling so uncomfortable in a social situation so that I clam up completely.,Looking back, almost all of the symptoms of my conditions started when I was at school. I’d find myself uncomfortable in classes of about 30 other people (Agoraphobia). I’d feel sad and down and suicidal almost all the time and my emotions became more intense as time grew on and I started having delusions, such as being convinced I could walk through walls or that I could read people’s minds amongst other things. This made school (and work since then) difficult (but not impossible) and because I knew very little about mental health issues I didn’t even realise what was happening to me and when it did start to sink in I didn’t say anything to anyone. I felt out of place already and telling anyone would make that worse.,My family have been the ones who have taken all of this the hardest and because of this I can’t talk to them. They choose to ignore it and, when my mental health is brought up, they say the nastiest of things. Well, to me that’s what they are. Things such as ""I wouldn’t trust my kids with someone with mental health problems” despite me never so much as hurting a fly and during a time where I self-harmed they would tell me that they’d harm themselves to show me what it’s like for them. I try and explain my conditions to them but explaining it to them or anyone else can be difficult for me. I get what can be called a “word salad” where I end up choosing words in a sentence that don’t fit the intended use of what I’m trying to say and people struggle to understand. I don’t always know how to make the words fit properly. But I keep trying as I believe informing people of what mental health really is will reduce the stigma attached to it over time.,I still experience all of these things but I’m trying to move on from them. As for the delusions and hallucinations that I experience, inside I still believe them to be real but I’m trying to put those beliefs to one side to try and have a happy life. I don’t believe they’ll ever truly go away but I intend to keep trying anyway."
,"During my work as a hypnotherapist, I’ve often been told that it’s not safe to work with someone who has a diagnosed ,. I’ve heard this from seniors in my field and from newer therapists who in turn are repeating what they were told.,Others say it’s ok to work with a depressed person as long as they’re not bipolar. And let me be clear, these people are not only saying that hypnotherapy isn’t an effective treatment for bipolar disorder itself, they’re saying that we shouldn’t hypnotise a bipolar person at all, for any reason.,So even if the client only wanted to quit smoking, we shouldn’t let them through the doors for fear of them having a psychotic episode! These opinions are generally based on stereotypes that don’t take into account the wide range of experiences that people on the bipolar spectrum can have.,I sit and listen to this, and I’d like to say, “actually, I have bipolar disorder.” I imagine the embarrassed silence that would follow. If it’s dangerous for a mentally ill person to receive hypnotherapy, how dangerous must it be for one to give it? I keep quiet not so much because I’m scared of being discredited – more because I don’t want to embarrass others by showing them how far inside their own mouth their foot is! I end up protecting them.,I don’t think many people who know me as a professional would ever consider that I might have a mental health condition, let alone one as famously ‘serious’ as I have. You could say that’s a tribute to my success but I also think it’s a sign of how much , still exists. My ability to function as a therapist – and in life generally - contradicts many of the popular stereotypes about someone with my diagnosis. I feel I’m living proof of how outdated and unhelpful those stereotypes are.,But I don’t want to have to talk about my most personal, private experiences when I’m at work. And often I can’t; when a client comes to me for help, they don’t want me to start talking about my own issues. A while ago, one woman contacted me to say that her GP had told her not to continue with hypnotherapy, because it wasn’t safe given her current depressed state. I felt that stigma had dealt me a double-blow: as a therapist trying to earn a living, I’d lost a client. And as a mental health patient, it was a reminder of how often we are told that we can’t trust our own minds, choose our own forms of therapy, or recognise when something is or isn’t safe for us. But In this case, like so many others, I felt I had to keep silent.,When I first began training in hypnotherapy, I hadn’t yet been diagnosed as ,. But I told my tutor (now my supervisor) about my history of depression, and when my diagnosis did change a few years ago, I kept him up to speed. I’ve had nothing but encouragement from him, as well as from my partner, close friends and family – and even from my psychiatrist, who fortunately has never seen a problem with me doing the work that I do.,But so far, I’ve always been very selective with who I do let in on the ‘secret.’ I am even cagey around most people I know socially, because they too know what I do for a living, and I’m embarrassed; concerned about the perceived conflict between these different parts of my life. It’s hard for me not to feel ashamed or apologetic about my illness. I think, how can I expect others to view me as being competent, professional, reliable or creditworthy, when I’m also part of a group that’s seen as being volatile, delusional and psychotic?,I’m gradually beginning to write more about my mental health and the conflicts it brings up and I’m expanding my ideas of who I can and can’t ‘tell.’ In fact, I’ve yet to really have a bad response from anyone I have directly talked to. But there are still many occasions when I don’t have the opportunity for self-disclosure - or don’t feel I should have to share personal information. If the , reduced, I think fewer people would repeat the stereotypes or generalisations they’d heard without stopping to think about how their words might affect other people in the room.,Follow Hannah on Twitter: "
,"I have always struggled to talk to my family about my mental health problems openly because I was scared I would not get the support that I need but obviously when you live in the same house, you cannot hide it from them. I live with an eating disorder, social anxiety disorder and depression, which my family find hard to take in. This has left me feeling like I am fighting this by myself and unfortunately, because I have very little support from loved ones, I am not getting any better.,In my experience, mental illness is a very taboo subject in Islam. You could argue that it is a taboo subject in general but, specifically in Islam, I have found that it can be incredibly difficult for family members to understand.,For me, this has always been the case. I did not open up to family members about this issue for a long time because I was ashamed to even admit it to them. I was afraid of their reaction and thought they would neglect me. So, after speaking to my eating disorder treatment team about being afraid to speak to my family, they offered to sit down with my family and explain to them about why I have this condition and what they are doing to help me, which has helped my family understand a little bit and reassured them that I can get better. I was surprised by their reaction. It was not as bad as I thought it would be. Now, it is easier for me to talk to my family about it but they still find it hard to understand fully.,An eating disorder affects the whole family, not just the sufferer. If I could control it, I would stop this right now and decide to get better to put my family at rest but it is not simple as that. To my family, I am the one who is “crazy” because I have mental health issues. I know they care and they do not understand the reasons behind why things are so hard for me. If they did, they would not think like they do. Support is what I need. They do not like to admit that I am suffering. It is very much like I am a different person to them, whom they wish was not abnormal. I seem to have become such a burden to my family and that makes me feel incredibly guilty.,This stigma has left me feeling rather lost and alone and like I have no one to turn to. Family is an important part in recovery and when you feel like you cannot talk to the people who you live with, your world seems even darker than it already is.,I think some Muslim families neglect the issue of mental illness because of a feeling that it brings shame on them and the reputation of the family. In Islam, we rely on God to heal us. If we are depressed or ill, we pray to God to make us better. We do our five prayers everyday and make du’aa (invocation) whenever possible. If you are a spiritual and faithful person and rely on God to make you better, then there is nothing wrong with that at all. I think that believing in a higher power when feeling down is the most amazing thing to have in you. However, combining proper treatment to get to the root of the illness will make the sufferer see things in a new light. God will always be there to turn to but, sometimes, we need to talk openly about our problems to someone who can help us practically as well as emotionally and create a support network of friends and family.,There is nothing wrong in asking for help. There is nothing wrong in going to your GP and admitting that you are experiencing a mental health problem and that you need psychological help.,I live within a big Muslim community and there is hardly any talk about mental illness. It is as if the problem does not exist. In fact, it seems like it should not exist because people are so ashamed of it and that makes me feel ashamed to even have an illness. We need to start talking.,Follow Habiba on ,."
,"I was ,in January 2012 with an estimated onset at puberty. Previously ,, anti depressants were making the mania worse.,Prior to this I had kept my mental health problems hidden from everyone but after 23 years of highs, lows, an eating disorder and OCD, I had a massive breakdown and finally started to receive some much needed help.,During my teenage years and through the majority of my adult life I always felt 'on the outside'. I had friends but was never part of the inner circle, never had that one best friend. I never felt quite right & wondered 'why me' on countless occasions.,I had always worked and just 3 days after my breakdown I spoke to my line manager and with their full support, returned to work. I have always been open and honest with my employer regarding my depression and bipolar. I think that they can’t help and support me if they don’t know what I am dealing with and how it affects me.,Anyway in hindsight returning to work so soon was a massive mistake, I gave myself no time to even see a GP and to talk about treatment options let alone to adjust and start to come to terms with what I was going to have to accept and adjust to.,I haven’t found I have had any problems or embarrassment in , following my breakdown, to work colleagues, my partner, friends or employer. I try to look at it that if people care about me then they will try to understand and those who think I’m just a bit upset or sitting at home having a nice time are not worth worrying about. I think that’s mainly down to the fact that after so many years I finally could begin to understand why I felt and behaved as I did.,Sometimes I still do find it hard to understand the reactions of people that I had hoped would try to understand and no matter how hard I try not to let this affect me I find myself getting frustrated & angry at the ignorance surrounding mental health.,In 2012 I became seriously ill and with the recommendation of my psychiatrist took 6 month off work. My line manager and HR manager continued to be fully supportive of my illness and related absence and we would have regular stay in touch meetings.,My job was managing a small team, many of which I had known for over 10 years. I am lucky in the fact that I have a very supportive HR manager and line manager and we agreed that it would be good for me to make short visits to the office which would help with my return.,During the first visit, the majority of my team snubbed me, some even getting up from their desk and walking away. I was upset and surprised but thought that maybe I had come in a busy time but this happened again on my second and last visit. Further investigation by senior management revealed that my team were of the opinion that if I was well enough to be out and about and able to visit then I should be at work. This attitude continued throughout my absence and unsurprisingly delayed my return.,I have now returned to work, after a very long phased return I decided I could not continue to manage these people, who I still have to sit with and who continue to make my life uncomfortable daily with whispering and comments about my health. So, after 25 years of hard work and finally understanding why I'm different, I still find myself 'on the outside'."
,"Okay maybe you don’t tell them straight away, I usually don’t, though I feel like they need to know about me in case I ever get in a bad way. Just so they are prepared for it - if I suddenly locked myself in my room all day, not eating or drinking, people would probably find me pretty weird if they didn’t know I had a mental illness.,This goes for ,especially. Living in a house full of budding students you are expected to go out daily and drink until the sun comes up and, don’t get me wrong, most of the time I’m up for it. But on some of those days, I’ll wake up, then just think “no, it’s not happening”, and stay in bed for the rest of the day. And if you consume alcohol in that state of mind, anything could happen, and I’d rather not risk it.,Luckily, all my housemates know about me. The conversations were really casual but they all know and understand to an extent. When I published my first blog there were people on my course and generally around university approaching me about it. It was nice in a way, people would say “I would never have known.” or “you’re such a happy depressive!”. I don’t know whether to say thank you, or to be like yeah, you haven’t seen the other side of me, she’s not happy at all.,As hard as it is to admit you have a , to someone you’ve just met, or someone who doesn’t know, it’s even harder trying to describe how it is. I’m going to be perfectly honest here: I’m absolutely terrified of my illness. It pains me to admit it but I am scared. Regardless of how long it’s been in my life (probably about six or seven years now), it still scares me when I go into a mood. I’m scared of what I’ll do, I’m scared of what I’ll say, I’m scared of how low I’ll get, I’m scared of whether I’d be able to handle it, I’m scared of hurting those around me, and most of all, I’m scared of the fact I lose all sense of rationality and control in those moods. It scares me to an extent where I’d say to my partner “I’m going into one, this is logical me speaking, and I’m going into one. I’m so, so sorry, just hug me until it’s over.” But of course, it isn’t over for hours, sometimes days, weeks or months if you’re unlucky.,If I’m scared of my illness, it would make other people scared too, and it just becomes a massive circle of uneasiness on both of our parts. If I’m at a party and we get on the subjects, some people are like “tell me what it’s like”, I’d just say “I can’t explain it.” partly because I can’t explain it, but also because I’m afraid that if I say “It’s terrifying, I get scared whenever it happens, it makes me want to harm or kill myself, and sometimes, I forget what I do... pass the chips.” It’s made university life very hard for me. I enjoy every minute of it but there’s a cloud of black smog over me that just reminds me of what I have.,It’s sad really. That I feel scared telling people about me, but also that I’m scared of my own illness. That’s really sad. And that shouldn’t be happening.,Talk. Face up to my fears and talk about it if they’re willing to listen. Maybe I can make even the most narrow-minded people open their eyes and realise that this illness is real. It’s real and it’s scary. At nineteen years old I'm still scared."
,"As it was my first event as a media volunteer for Time to Change, I had no idea what to expect from their ,. The debate held at Channel 4 centred on the participation of people with experience of mental health problems in entertainment or reality TV. I was intrigued about what direction the debate would take and a little dubious about how the subject would be received. However, throughout the evening I was positively surprised by how engaged the audience and panel were.,I was nervous to talk about my own experiences, mainly because I worry it makes people feel awkward but I believe in openness and honesty about mental health to break down the stigma. My mum had bipolar and tragically completed suicide earlier this year. One of the things that struck me was the media coverage surrounding her death and the reporting of her mental health. The media frequently refused to use the word bipolar when describing my mum and instead opted for depression as they claimed ""people don't know enough about bipolar but people can understand depression,"" so I was curious to see the perspectives from the media audience.,I had the chance to speak to a few producers before the debate began and the general consensus was that you can’t admit if you have a mental health problem in this industry for fear of being judged and not getting work. I wasn’t surprised to hear this but it made me a little angry that it’s so widespread that it’s the norm to be forced to hide certain aspects of who you are. Later on I reflected that I too would probably hide it from prospective employers for fear of the repercussions, so I think this sadly spreads much further than just this industry,Our host Anna Williamson was bravely honest about her experiences and gained a lot of respect from the audience and especially me. It’s incredibly important to be open and honest, but I know all too well how hard it can be to stand in front of people and talk so candidly. I was impressed to hear that ITV were very supportive to Anna during her most difficult time.,First to talk about her experience was former Big Brother contestant Nikki Grahame. She initially disclosed her mental health problems in her audition and didn’t get through. So when she auditioned the second time she didn’t disclose them. Justin Gorman (Head of entertainment at Channel 4) responded to this revelation with: ""There is no reason why people from all backgrounds shouldn't be on TV as we should represent the country as a whole; however we have a duty of care"".,Throughout the debate there was lots of interaction on the twitter hashtag – it was definitely a big debate on social media with not everyone agreeing with the concept of the discussion.,The overriding thought with X Factor’s controversial new twist was although it was unnecessarily cruel; unfortunately people didn't turn it off. This means it becomes part of the show as viewing figures remain high. Shirlena Johnson (former contestant) said being kicked off the X Factor because of her mental health problems was ""terrible"". She quite rightly believes she should have been the one to make that decision, not producers. One of the questions posed was who should make the decision regarding featuring people with mental health problems? It seems to me that everyone should be allowed to make their own choices, as long as producers act responsibly and with care.,""The issue is around exploitation, we wouldn't discriminate but safety is key"" said Jim Sayer, from Maverick TV. ""We take our duty of care very seriously"".,It is important to show the wide spectrum of mental health as 1 in 4 of us is affected by mental health problems. Elliot Reed from BBC3 says the mental health season on the channel ""benefitted everyone involved - paving the way forward"".,Overall it felt positive for people in the industry to come together and openly engage and discuss such an important topic. I was encouraged that people were keen to learn more and share their thoughts on best practises. It was also great to have people on the panel with real experiences and so willing to be truthful about what they have been through.,There is clearly a need for this type of event and the more we discuss it and seek to understand – the better. I came away feeling really positive. After the debate I spoke to one producer who said:,""Surely the key thing is to be a decent human being and make sure everyone on TV gets looked after properly, whether you have a mental health problem or not."",I couldn’t have put it better myself."
,"I have lived with very serious, treatment resistant , since 1994 - well the truth is, I suffered a continuous 7 year episode until I had neurosurgery in 2001 and then 5 years later I suffered a serious relapse..,I wrote a book about my first experience and it was published in 2005 (Life After Darkness). I am a normal person who just happens to be a doctor too and I experienced this awful depression when I should have been rejoicing that I had just been given a part time training post in A&E, allowing me more time to spend with my husband and 4 lovely children. Instead I found myself admitted to a psychiatric hospital, feeling suicidal and needing all the help I could get.,I wrote the book after my recovery to tackle the ,. I found that some of the nursing staff had not treated me well, some of the hospital doctors in the nearby general hospital where I was taken after self harm had not treated me well, friends had abandoned me and even some of my wider family had no idea how to talk to me about my illness, so it was just ignored. I came across some lovely psychiatric staff too and realised that they are stigmatised within the medical profession for working in psychiatry – something has to change!,I decided that when I returned to work (in the A&E where I had been taken as a self harming depressed patient) I would be open about my illness. I wasn’t sure what sort of response I would get and was worried about it but, nonetheless, did not want to have to lie. So when I was asked why I had had so much time out of medicine, I would tell the truth.,I was surprised that nearly everyone I talked to was interested in my response and wanted to talk more. It seemed that me being open literally broke down a barrier and people became more friendly. I found it hard at first, my heart used to pound, particularly when I wondered whether they had treated me when I was depressed. Slowly it became easier. My fear that people would think less of me when I talked about it weren’t realised.,I soon started doing the teaching in the department on mental illness, giving myself as the example; many of the doctors I taught said it brought the whole subject into the open and that they gained insight into the whole area of self harm, saying things like ‘ I’ve never thought of it that way’. I also started to challenge those who did have negative attitudes towards the mentally ill. When my book came out, many of the staff bought it and told me how brave I was to write it.,However my relapse meant more time off work and another hospital admission. At least the church I was attending had had a seminar addressing mental illness, so I received support and friendship from people I hardly knew. Sadly this isn’t always the case and some churches positively ostracise those living with depression – this led me to writing yet another book (‘A Thorn In My Mind’) to tackle stigma within churches. How absurd that a faith that should be embracing the sick and the lonely, the rejected and the forlorn as Jesus did in his lifetime, should be so uneducated about mental illness.,However some good things are happening, there is now an excellent website for Christians called ',', there are more people talking about their illnesses and more church leaders are understanding the fact that 1 in 4 of us will experience mental illness at some time in our lives. In medical practice the A&E departments have had more training in the needs of those with mental health problems or who have self harmed. But still work needs to be done.,I, for one, will not stop talking about my illness. It is hard to do so sometimes. I am vulnerable when I open myself up and misunderstanding seems all too easy. I like to be treated as a normal person, which I am, not as someone who needs to be pitied or tiptoed around.,I recently had an operation on my foot and have to wear a surgical boot as a result. It’s obvious – people on the tube ask me what’s happened and friends I know repeatedly express their concern. Yet, depression has no outward signs and is far harder to cope with. I still put on ‘a front’ when I suffer as I still come across unhelpful reactions. I’m fine talking about it when it’s over but when facing the hideous symptoms it can be incredibly lonely.,Once again I have had to start work after a long period away from medicine. Only last week, I was telling one of the young doctors that the reason I had time out was because I was depressed – all in the hearing of nurses and doctors in the coffee room. Her face betrayed surprise but she was interested and asked me questions about it and how it was for me coming back into work again.,I definitely feel it is better to come out with it straight away and to be positive about it. I don’t want to find myself giving excuses or being vague about the time off and leaving people to try and guess why it happened. I act like I’m not the slightest bit embarrassed and it seems to give people permission to not be embarrassed about speaking about it either.,In more private settings, I have found such conversations often give people the opportunity to talk about their own encounters with mental illness, whether it be themselves, relatives or friends who are the sufferers. When I am well, I feel good about myself and want to help anyone in this situation whatever their background, creed or nationality. When I am down, negative thinking has crept in and I am not so sure I am any help to anyone! But I do know talking about it, is good, so I will!"
,"June 2009. A hot summer night in Manchester. It finally happened. I was on the pavement, cradled in the arms of my best friend.My face felt as if it was on fire and I could hear someone screaming hysterically. It took me a moment to realise that this sound was coming from me.,I had hit rock bottom.,It's hard for me to say when my descent into , began. After all, it's not like there's a rule book, or a certain path you take; it just happens. At school I was always aware that I was different. At the time it didn't bother me, I was just a kid trying to fit in with everyone else, like everyone does when they're in school.,It was only when I left school and went to college that I realised it was becoming a problem for me.,The time I really began to notice how bad things were was when a friend of mine pointed out to me how dramatically my moods would shift. One minute I would be bouncing of every wall, talking a mile a minute, wanting to do a million things at once. The next I would be morose and downtrodden, pondering my existence and wondering where my life was going. Although I listened to his advice to go and see a doctor, I chose to ignore it rather than confront it head on.,It didn't help that during this time of my life I went through a series of changes. I was being promoted at work, I was going through a turbulent period with a close friend, and I had recently ended my first real relationship. Looking back, this is probably why I ended up sobbing hysterically on the pavement of Manchester's Canal Street several months later. I chose not to face my fears of admitting I may have had something wrong with me, and I paid the price.,Over the next year, I began to realise why I kept it a secret. My family didn't 'believe' in depression and weren't especially understanding - in particular I remember a day of not being able to physically get out of bed and face the world, and my parents told me 'this wasn't the way to behave' and 'everyone gets depressed, but they get over it'.,A boss of mine at work casually asked why I had to have my breakdown when I've got such a great opportunity in front of me i.e. my promotion, as if I had meticulously planned to have a breakdown to fit my work pattern. My second relationship went down in flames as my then-partner so sensitively announced to me that he 'couldn't handle this'. It was this kind of behaviour that made me understand why I didn't want to accept my mental illness.,Even so, I eventually sought out help at my local doctors. It wasn't something I wanted to do, but when you're regularly having hallucinations about killing yourself and are having a constant battle with your conscience, it was probably for the best. Having a stranger to talk to who was completely unbiased helped me enormously, and I was able to talk about issues that I'd never spoken about to anyone. There was no doubt in my mind that this was a step towards a more positive future.,Three years on, and it's the present day. Twelve counselling sessions, a number of mental health experts, several referrals and a diagnosis for , later, and I finally feel like I have handles on my mental state. I have read enough books, stories and papers on mental illness to last me another lifetime, have tried several alternative therapy methods, and eventually managed to read the signs that my body sends out. The biggest and most positive experience I have taken from this is that eventually, no matter how endless the time in between healing can seem, no matter how wretched that hollow may be, you eventually begin to understand yourself and accept how you are.,My parents will never fully appreciate or understand mental illness, but God love them, they try. My boss supports me in every imaginable way, which I'm eternally grateful for, but best of all, my friends are my lifeline. They have seen things, read things, and heard things that no one should ever have to, yet they'd happily sit on the phone at 4am listening to me if it means having someone there for me when I truly need it.,Advice is something that's arbitrary and often feels somewhat futile to me - everyone's story and experiences are different, and advice isn't always going to appeal to everyone. However, if I had to give anyone advice on how to deal with their mental illness, whatever it may be, it would be this: deal with things in your own time and in your own way, but the most important thing is acceptance. You may need medication, you may not, you may need a counsellor for the next year, or five, or ten, just for someone to be there to get it all of your chest.,But first, lift your head up, lock eyes with someone, and open your mouth and work your tongue around these words, 'I'm not OK. I need help.',That's the first step., "
,"Living with some fairly colourful mental health challenges over most of my working life has meant I’ve developed a good understanding of how my colleagues’ perceive mental health issues and indeed deal with their own.,A couple of years back a work mate was really struggling. His workload and responsibilities were getting to him and I could sense he was under pressure. He became much quieter and detached from his colleagues and clearly didn’t want to openly discuss his issues.,Eventually he went to the GP and started to address things. But what really saddened me was how a couple of senior staff responded to this. Independently from each other they both explained to me…’it’s ok, he’s not ill, he’s just stressed; he needs to toughen up’.,This just simply re-affirmed the uncertainties and ,, and how we often fail to deal with the causes before it’s too late.,My own issues had started about ten years ago. I didn’t talk to anyone at the time either. Emotionally I was all over the place. I was stressed and ,. I had a busy, stressful job, a young family and my first mortgage. I didn’t know how to get on top of the situation. It continued to develop and my symptoms increased. I started to experience chronic ,and ,; and this frightened the life out of me at the time.,‘Am I going mad?’ I would ask myself.,Things came to a head when I had a massive panic attack in front of several colleagues whilst chairing a high profile meeting. Wow…the embarrassment, confusion and emotion was crippling, but at least it dawned on me I needed help!,I went to my GP who assured me…’I know you’re not going mad sir. If you were losing your mind you wouldn’t be so self-aware’ he said. This actually really helped me.,Starting to open up to my work colleagues was a massive breakthrough for me but what a difficult breakthrough to make. All kinds of thoughts went through my head…’they’ll be laughing behind my back, think I’m being soft, being lazy, weak etc’…,I knew it was my only way forward though. What had dawned on me was that I could never beat my issues by masking them. It was absolutely exhausting trying to remain calm on the exterior whilst struggling like mad on the inside. I couldn’t continue the act any longer. I had to face up to my issues and learn to accept them.,I’d been off work for a while so people knew things weren’t right. Naturally they started to ask me how I felt.,I started to explain I was experiencing anxiety, panic and stress issues and that life was a struggle at times but I was learning to deal with them and not hide away.,This acceptance and openness released a massive amount of pressure off me from trying to permanently portray that cool, calm and confident professional that we often pressurise ourselves to be.,What also amazed me was how many others opened up about their issues once provoked. This often created such a positive experience for both of us. Listening to each other’s issues, sharing stories and experiences (often quite humorous on reflection!) and ideas on dealing with issues in our working lives.,Others perhaps didn’t understand, or perhaps felt uncomfortable. That’s absolutely fine. At least I’ve been honest with them, they are aware of my challenges and I’ve also raised awareness of mental health in the workplace. All positives!,I can’t articulate in the blog enough just how important , is. For me, it really does take the pressure off from trying to be someone who I’m not. What I am is a professional businessman who lives with anxiety, panic and stress challenges. Sometimes they impact my work life but that’s absolutely fine. They can be managed and I’m comfortable with that.,I don’t expect everyone to understand my issues, I just ask for acceptance. If they can’t accept it then they’re the one with the problems, not me.,My ultimate point to all this is we must collectively (employees and employers) look to continuously and proactively address the causes of mental health in the workplace. It’s an old cliché but prevention is so much better than cure when it comes to mental health.,It’s time to talk and listen about mental health,It’s time to understand and learn,It’s time to fight and beat it!"
,"I’m really glad ,.,Let me explain myself. I like horror films, but that’s not the reason I’m glad. I like fancy dress, but that’s not the reason either. I like a laugh, and Halloween costumes are meant to be funny as well as scary, aren’t they? But that’s not the reason either.,No, I’m glad those outfits were made and sold for one reason – they have made a lot of people angry. And when that many people get angry about something, things change. People speak out, loudly and publicly. Their views get into the mainstream media. And suddenly, there is a powerful movement in society, united in anger and in a desire for change.,Things have changed today. Tesco and Asda have acted and removed the products from stock. How did they come to be stocked in the first place? I don’t know. Who made and marketed the appalling things in the first place? I don’t know that either.,What I do know is that no amount of positive blogs about mental health or courageous spokespeople have the same impact as collective fury, and today that fury made two of the biggest names in British retail change their actions – and you can bet they won’t let it happen again in a hurry.,There’s unquestionably a , that lives on and manifests in unlikely ways and places – like a Halloween costume. The outpouring of anger at these costumes is not the same thing as ‘political correctness gone mad’ or ‘not being able to take a joke’. It’s a response to the belittling or stigmatising of people who are ill through no fault of their own. It’s an insult to one in four members of our population.,As someone who’s had counselling for , and taken antidepressants for more than three years, I could be very upset about the demonization and stereotyping of people who need treatment for mental illness. But I’m not upset.,I’m glad that something high-profile and relatively easy to resolve has happened that shakes people up a bit and makes mental health a little bit easier for people to talk about."
,"Growing up, I always felt inspired by my Grandfather. After his death, I felt I couldn't show the weaker side of myself and it's something that I deeply regret. I lost myself, I struggled and I haven't really found myself since.,I've always been the strong minded person in my family, I would stick up for those around me and I wasn't really bothered if I was hurting because, like my grandfather, I would always put my family before myself.,I put all my commitments after school into progressing into work, I often felt out of sorts and scared to make friends. I wouldn't say I was shy, although reserved would suit me well. I never really spoke to anyone about how I felt. I wish I had spoken to my mum but I always knew this was likely to upset her and how do you tell someone your still hurting over the death of a loved one?,Between work, I started dating a girl who would become my future wife. I can't tell you how happy I was to have someone but it lifted a great weight of my mind and for a period I managed to forget about how I truly felt deep inside.,We found ourselves on the verge of becoming parents. Sadly, our baby was born still on the same day my Grandfather passed away. I told myself repeatedly it was my fault and also that it was just a coincidence but I felt like I had no right to be happy – for me it was sign.,I slid back into the darkness, it hurts because I feel I have no right. My wife would cry and you could see in her eyes that her world had been taken but I felt I had to the strong person, which I simply wasn't.,My moods developed into anger, I was scared of losing everything and I felt that I couldn't get close to people because for me, I worried they would die or simply not understand me. I kept myself to working, drawing away from anything fun. Yet, surprisingly, my wife (then girlfriend) stuck by me and she realized something was wrong. It seemed scary telling my local GP how I felt though. I knew something was wrong but I was scared to be treated differently.,I stepped away from working for a short period of time to help take care of my mother, though I returned to work a little later on and I was discriminated against due to my ,. My General Manager actually wrote on my Facebook Wall after the death of my Grandmother 'Erm, Can't you stop being sick?' despite being approved for sick leave. I hadn't had a day off work prior and this made me very unhappy, to the point I felt I couldn't give myself time.,My suicidal thoughts usually only flicker, I could easily think of something else but one night while at work I became so low after being treated unfairly that I nearly attempted suicide but was stopped by a friend (also a manager).,After that day I decided to speak with someone and seek help, it didn't really work for me but I felt happier within myself.,I keep falling off every now and then. I become low and wish I had someone away from my family I could speak to. Despite my family, life isn't all that perfect but I try my best. I recently looked into a different type of therapy which looks at my behaviour and triggers, it's made a huge difference.,Between making new friends and working on my hobbies, I've started to fill a gap that I have been missing. My wife and 3 wonderful children complete my life so much more than I can say and without them the thoughts would be most likely present in my mind. With them, just seeing their faces can make me happy.,My advice is to speak to someone and put more trust in being you, I know I will."
,"Before I was formerly diagnosed with severe depression, OCD and anxiety I remember the daily struggle I had trying to understand how and why I always felt so down.,I walked around with a weight on my chest that never went away. It was difficult for me to come to terms with the changes that had taken place in me over a matter of months. I was losing friends because of my behaviour, and all I wanted, more than anything else, was to go back to being my happy, cheerful self. I wanted to genuinely smile and laugh until my stomach hurt.,A little while later, I had finally sought help for what I was going through and had started Cognitive Behavioural Therapy. I began understanding why I thought certain things and what made me react in a certain manner. I was beginning to accept myself and my condition.,One day on my way to university, I spotted a woman with a bright, colourful tote bag walking in front of me. However, my eyes landed the clear bold print sprawled across the bag: “Happiness is a choice”. I felt the familiar tightness in my chest as I went over the phrase in my head. Happiness is a choice. Happiness is a choice. Happiness is a choice. So does that mean I chose to be sad? Are millions of people who suffer from mental health illness just going through painful and traumatic experiences because they chose to? Obviously not. I was filled with sudden rage. I even considered going after the woman and asking for explanations, but alas my anxiety had other plans.,I was filled with rage at the thought that this woman, and anyone who would buy or make such a bag, genuinely thought happiness was a choice. Until then, I had always kept my mental health illness a secret because I assumed people would react negatively because of the stigma attached. I never realised that I had to ,. I had to talk about it because it was not a choice. I had to talk about it because I couldn’t let people think it was a choice. I was just coming to terms with the fact that I would have to live with this, possibly for the rest of my life. I didn't want to have to deal with people thinking I chose this for myself. Mental health stigma had never been visible to me before.,If it were a choice, why would anyone choose anything but happiness? The implication was clearly if you’re sad you choose to be so for attention or self-pity or out of laziness. If anything, , made me want to isolate myself from everyone. Attention was possibly the last thing I wanted.,I realise now that anger was not the right emotion. I now know how difficult it is for someone who doesn’t have a mental health illness to understand just how debilitating it can be. I have no reason to be angry with her, or those like her. When I think of that woman today I’m filled with sadness that I never got to explain to her how I, and many like me, do not chose to be like this.,Now if the opportunity arises I try to explain and encourage dialogue, however daunting and challenging it may be to speak about my experiences. It breaks my heart that on top of fighting for their lives, many also have to fight against the ignorance that surrounds their illness, but it makes me truly proud to see how far we have come to conquer the stigma."
,"How we , is hindered by many factors. One factor that can make it harder for people to talk about illness in most cases is embarrassment.,I certainly know people who will never discuss my , directly. Some friends know that I have it, yet if conversation meanders towards it there is often an uncomfortable exchange of embarrassed squeaks and then a desperate scanning of the room to see if someone is nearby to drag them away to the safety of nob jokes and lager.,It is much easier to nod and steer the talk towards some fluff or to indulge in some ‘banter’ that shields you from the prospect of ‘getting involved’ in others’ affairs.,I know I feel the same, at times, when someone is talking about their job or hobby in anything but a passing statement.,If I don’t like their hobby or don’t know (or want to know) anything about their job then it can be lost on me. My friends do a variety of jobs ranging from the very interesting to what, for some, seem mind-bogglingly complicated and ultimately dull.,To understand the importance of that job chat to your friend is half the point. They are not alone in their endeavours and they have friends around them who appreciate their lives as more than a social front.,In reality it is hard to maintain that level of interest in something you don’t understand.,I feel I am generally an open person who will happily discuss all manner of life’s woes or joys with my friends. At varying points in my life I have been seen as an accessible agony aunt for friends and family of all ages and personalities.,Reversing that role has become more difficult as I have grown older. In part I think this can be attributed to a ‘learned’ behaviour, in that I have historically been the shoulder to cry on or giver of advice so I find it hard to spin that position and make a beeline to the nearest friendly shoulder.,I have a front that I have maintained for many years that has engraved itself so deeply on my being that, in the past, when that front has fallen, or worse been torn away by someone else, my ill-self has been known to react in a desperate and desperately destructive way.,This alone could be enough for someone to be reticent in disclosing illness. What makes it harder is that, when you do open up, some people will not, and do not, understand.,For example:,A couple of years ago I 'came out' as depressed to a group of close friends and immediately one of my closest friends came back with the suggestion that ‘It’s not that bad!’ and ‘You don’t seem depressed so really it’s just a matter of not letting it get to you’ and similar.,I don’t begrudge my friend for expressing this way of thinking. I know it was done through love and it is virtually impossible to understand the exact thinking going on in anyone’s head if you haven’t suffered in the same way; empathy stretches only so far.,This exchange didn’t bother me that much in that moment as I was carried on the adrenaline of having plucked up the courage to discuss it with my mates.,Over the next couple of years the meaning of the exchange developed.,I felt unable to instigate any chats about my head state, as they were pretty much dismissed then, or to get into the detail of why those statements were wrong. It doesn’t matter if I look ok, you will find people with depression can be very adept at hiding their inner feelings to a point where they can seem undetectable and when disclosed unbelievable.,That is part of the problem, you give yourself a persona that is almost the opposite of what is clawing away just behind your eyes, constantly scratching, making maintaining the persona your only way of maintaining a grasp on reality.,I don’t blame anyone for having a misdirected opinion of depression and how it affects people, because I have spent half a lifetime honing my skills in the art of mental deception.,This is an extract from a blog published here: "
,"The thing about mental illness is that it can affect anyone. The other thing about mental illness is that it is largely a silent sickness.,No matter what age you are, what gender you are, if you are rich or poor, married or single, mental illness does not discriminate.,According to the Mental Health Foundation 1 in 4 people will experience some kind of mental health problem in any given year, so why does nobody talk about it?,Can you imagine the news headlines if experts estimated that 1 in 4 people will suffer from measles within any given year? Campaigners would go out and raise awareness about the risk of contracting measles and what to do if you notice symptoms.,Experts would undertake risk assessments and emergency procedure assessments, and just about any other assessment that you can think of. If you contracted measles or someone you know happened to get it, would you be embarrassed about it?,When you pass Mrs Jones-from-three-doors-down in the street, would you invent a story to explain why you haven't been out of the house for a while? Or would you just come out and say it : I've had the measles. Chances are that Mrs Jones would say something along the lines of "" Oh you poor dear ! I hope you're feeling better now."",Could you expect the same response if you told her that you haven't left the house for the past week because you had depression? Would you even tell her that you had depression?,That is the reason that mental illness is the monster in the room. It is not the elephant in the room. Elephants are too noisy. They draw too much attention to themselves. Mental illness is a monster. It is a monster without a voice box.,It sits silently in the corner of your living room and you cover it with a throw, much like you would do an ugly sofa. When someone visits they know that the sofa underneath the throw is ugly. They want to lift the throw aside to see how bad the sofa underneath really is - is it a beige monstrosity, or a yellow velvet number? But they won't look under that throw.,You might be tempted to lift it up for them and say ""look at this horrible sofa,"" but you won't do it. Because then you would have to talk about the sofa and how bad it is. Maybe your visitor has a horrible sofa at home as well, but they cover theirs up with a patchwork quilt. They don't want to admit to their own couch inadequacies because you won't admit to yours.,That silent monster follows you around and you are constantly finding new ways to cover it up. One day it sits in your handbag like a miniature Chiwawa, the next you try to hide it under your shirt. Each day the silent monster grows and mutates. Each day it is a battle to get from one moment to the next because of the monster. Even the small things seem like mountains to climb. Yet to that daily battle we add the struggle to keep the monster hidden.,What if we were to uncover the monster? How can we expect Mrs Jones-from-three-doors-down to discuss our depression if we won't even admit to it ourselves?,It is all very well and good to say that people should , but who is ""people""? The thing is, someone has to make the first move. We can support campaigns from the sidelines all we want, but someone has got to start that process. That someone is not going to be a person who has no experience of mental illness. That someone has got to be a person who has lived it. Someone else cannot come and uncover your silent monster because you are the one who has hidden it.,You have to make the first move and pull it out from under the bookshelf or from behind the TV, or wherever else you have hidden it today. You have got to seize hold of it and push it into the daylight. However scary, painful or embarrassing that may seem. Only when it is out in the light can we see what it really is. Who knows, maybe someone else has a matching monster. Maybe you can share tips on how you deal with it. Maybe you will even inspire someone else to uncover their own silent monster and give it a voice. Only then can we hope to create an atmosphere of open discussion about mental illness and only then can we hope to reduce the stigma which surrounds it."
,"How often do we still hear that phrase? There are of course many words to describe personality types – loud, extrovert, introvert, shy, quiet, fun, reserved, warm, aloof etc – we naturally form opinions of others when we first meet them.,Some people will suspend these judgements and take time to get to know the person a little more and others will stick with their initial impression. We are obviously all different.,My experience for most of my child and adult life, for some people that met me was I was “quiet”. As people chatted to me they may have found I had knowledge in my interests and liked to talk a little about them but, depending on the situation, I was mostly the quiet one. In groups I would go missing, say nothing until asked then quickly try to go back to saying nothing.,And what other impressions do we, in general, gather about someone who is very quiet in social situations? Perhaps that they are shy, reserved, snobby, not much to her, poor verbal communicator, blank, guarded, no sense of humour, hard to talk to, doesn’t give much away, a dark horse. These are all comments from friends and nursing colleagues I have heard – not about myself but about others who are ‘quiet’ in social situations. They do not realise that if they had met me three years ago they would have been talking about me in that way.,I now consider myself to be a happy, confident, self assured person and also a qualified mental health nurse. Three years ago I was so depressed I wanted to kill myself. I would never have done it but the thought did cross my mind quite a bit. The problem? I couldn’t talk!,I was a nurse who was so shy in groups I couldn’t talk. I wanted the ground to swallow me up when everyone looked at me. I could at first just get by but every time I moved new jobs to try again to fit in the problem just kept getting worse. Why could I not feel 100% happy around people? Or at least 40% would have done me! Why was I like this?,I then found the answer: ahhh that’s right, I’m just a quiet person. I don’t know much about anything other than football and music, my passions. I don’t laugh when everyone else does at jokes because I have no sense of humour. I don’t attract successful good looking men like my peers do I had been on dates and made a fool out of myself because I just couldn’t talk. The words just didn’t ever come I had nothing to say.,So my explanation was set in stone. That’s why. Because I’m dull, boring , worthless and couldn’t possibly look after patients with mental health problems when I couldn’t talk. That was it.. It was just awkward for everyone to be with me.,Thank god I said three words that changed my life to my mum. One night I broke down and let out the words “I hate myself”. At this point all the pain anger frustration and loneliness spilled from me and wouldn’t stop. It’s literally like a flood when you finally tell someone. It was a shock for my mum but from that moment on I have never looked back.,Three years later I am still a registered mental health nurse but I am confident and happy. I have a supportive partner (who was someone I never thought would really want me) and a wonderful life (apart from the odd ups and downs that never leave you ,).,But I have learnt to embrace life and live it to the full after I have been rock bottom. I will never forget this and will always stick up for all the quiet people out there. They might be aloof and snobby but, then again, they might be suffering like I was."
,"When I was first , brought on by a fairly impressive breakdown owing to work stresses in 2007, a most unlikely friend and ally came into his own.,Whilst I was lucky to have the support and concern of my family and best friends, it was Pete, who was back then really no more than an acquaintance or casual friend, that reached out to me and helped me to recover.,It was empathy that cemented this bond between us. I was aware that Pete's eldest brother had died a few years earlier as a result of his own , so I guess on some level he understood what I was going through more than anybody else.,Back in 2007 when I got ill, we'd arranged to go, before my breakdown, to Glastonbury Festival. I was assured by all my friends in the party that they would look after me and they did, putting up with my occasional fainting and general slow progress around the site brought on by panic attacks at the size of the crowds. But it was Pete who became my guide that weekend; if I wished to go and see a band that the rest of the group were not interested in, he'd happily troop through the mud with me so I could replenish my natural serotonin through the enjoyment of the music.,From then I realised that I had a great friend who I could always rely on if things got tough again.,Mental illness and depression being what they are, there have been less serious relapses since 2007 but beyond my long suffering wife (who I hold in equal thrall) it’s always been Pete who's spotted the symptoms way before anyone else. When my Facebook or twitter posts have been edged with darkness, he's always been the first to respond and offer assistance. Often this is all that is needed; a friend who understands to just be there and to listen usually helps me to pull out of most flat spins.,Over six months ago I lost my job because my mental health issues were deemed too severe for me to do my job. Straightaway it was Pete who came to me and said if I couldn't find any work he had a suitable position for me within his company that would be available in 6 months time. As I write I've been working for Pete for a month which admittedly is strange having a close friend as your boss but what better support could you ask for?,He understands better than anyone how I work, what drives me and I truly hope I will repay his trust with good work, loyalty and productivity. I also know deep down that if I have to step down as a result of not being able to cope, he wouldn't judge me either; the mark, of course, of a true friend.,You'd be surprised who, when the wheels come off, steps out from the shadows to help. But just because you don't know them that well, you shouldn't dismiss their offers of support. Those that have the understanding or experience of mental health issues in their lives will more often 'get you' so much easier and quicker than those close to you who naturally need time to see through your mood swings and such behaviour. You'd be surprised just how helpful the Pete's in your world can be."
,"I am a mother, a daughter, a partner, a professional, a friend.,I am what mental illness looks like.,This is the first time I have spoken openly about my battle with mental illness. I am speaking out because I hope that my doing so will encourage other people to do the same and help tackle the stigma that still surrounds the subject.,I am Nae, I am 31 and you may have seen me on your TV screens. I am an actress.,I am Nae, the mother, the daughter, the lover, the friend - I am Nae and I have Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder also known as , and I suffer with Clinical ,.,Unfortunately my disorder and my depression are very resistant to medication, so are proving difficult to manage. Like everyone else I have good days and bad days, on a good day I function fully and am completely well whilst on a bad day I barely function at all.,It is difficult to explain Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder, someone once described it to me as the emotional equivalent to a person with 3rd degree burns being touched. I have severe, irrational and unpredictable shifts in mood and emotion. Strong urges to harm myself, sometimes on a very serious level. Overwhelming feelings of nothingness that leave me paralysed by pain and anxiety. I have difficulty maintaining friendships; can be very impulsive and sometimes delusional.,Depression is as physically debilitating as it is mentally. I fail to meet my most basic needs, it isn't pretty. I can't wash myself, dress myself, and brush my teeth. I have no interest in anything. I lose the capacity to love and be loved. I become reclusive, shut everybody out, avoid phone calls etc. My body completely shuts down, everything hurts. The only place you find comfort is in bed, curtains closed, alone until the darkness shifts.,I was so resistant to accept the diagnosis that I had mental health disorders because I knew the weight of the label 'mental illness'. I suppose if I'm honest I had my own preconceptions of what 'those' people looked and behaved like and I didn't fit the mould so to speak. Now I realise there is no mould to fit into. I am mental illness. The first hurdle was accepting that. I am mental illness.,Now I make a point of being completely open about my health issues because I want to challenge the misconceptions that people have. The prejudice is so suffocating. It restricts my recovery and isolates me further triggering the darker sides of the illness. I absolutely witness the silence that that honesty provokes, the way people's eyes change; you feel them taking an Emotional and mental step backwards from you. Is it fear? Are they thinking, ""If it can affect her it can affect me too?"" I don't know, but I can't let their issues affect my values. I have a mental illness and that's ok.,I honestly have no idea how my being open will affect me career wise, I have a fear that the phone will stop ringing, that the hard work and dedication will amount to nothing because mental illness isn't marketable. The ever increasing pressure to be perfect in the spotlight that comes with working in the media, mental illness doesn't fit. Also if my illness affects my ability to perform in a extremely high pressure environment, such as an audition, I don't believe this will be overlooked and my career experience be taken onboard instead. In the acting world you're judged at face value and sometimes that's my illness. I hope I am wrong, I suppose time will tell.,I met Lorna from Time to Change a while back and we became friends. Some time later, Lorna started to work for the campaign press team and it was hearing about the work she and others were doing that led me to think 'enough is enough' - I wanted to speak out, to let people know what I was going through, but to also help others to know they are not alone.,Mental illness isn't just having a bad day that you can snap out of. It's so irrational and at time completely defies your intelligence and intellect. What's frustrating is that there is no physical manifestation that people can see to understand what is going on. It's a silent illness that people don't talk about and therefore isn't validated by the sufferer or the people supporting the sufferer.,It becomes something shameful, a dark secret, another thing to carry on top of the illness itself. This is why the 'Time to Change' campaign that mental health charities Mind and Rethink are running is so important. Communication is a vital stepping stone along with medication and therapy on the path to recovery. ,, it affects every age, sex, race, religion and can happen at anytime in your life. We owe it to ourselves to start talking about the elephant in the room. It is 'time to talk'.,Jessica blogs at "
,"After watching ‘,’, I was inspired by Clarke Carlisle’s honesty and bravery to share my own experience. The documentary highlighted the public pressure footballers deal with and I identified with it my experience as an elected student officer for a university students’ union about nine years ago.,As anyone who has gone through an election process and held office would know, the job in itself is incredibly challenging and rewarding. Through that elected term I had the misfortune of going through a multitude of traumatic life events.,At the time I very much felt the pressure of my inexperience and immaturity in dealing with my life properly. Also, at the beginning of the term I fell in love with a person who within the first six months of our relationship had been sectioned twice. I had a 12 hour working day and spent every weekend at a mental health ward in another city.,It was here I encountered first hand , from my well-meaning and supposedly politically astute friendship group. They all, bar two, advised ending the relationship and emphasized that relationships are a selfish option I could willingly get out of. Only two good friends were able to fully understand the situation and gave very heartfelt and useful advice, and this was because they had known good friends who experienced mental illnesses.,The rest of the elected term was incredibly emotionally straining. The job itself was fantastic, it challenged and developed many skills and I am proud to have been part of such interesting times and worked with amazing staff and students. But they do say hell is other people, and my relationships with my elected colleagues were strained to the full.,This is somewhat expected within the student elected sphere, personalities and political agendas are bound to clash. However, my private life continued to be full of drama. I would list all the events but it would read like a black comedy piece. The immense pressure at work came from the perceived expectation to “deal with it”, especially as I was in a “leadership” role. In a way it was flattering that people expected better of me, but I also became viewed as someone who was “always going through something” and the ungraceful way I had dealt with my life had tested everyone’s patience.,Being all of 21 I was blinded by pride and ignorance of the support I could, and should, have sought. Looking back I should have talked to the staff in my department and been open about what I was going through and my limitations. I should also have been honest with myself. It was an age, as well as a sphere (student politics), where I found weakness to be disrespected and the admittance of defeat seen as cowardly.,But I did not seek help, not only because of pride, but because I was unable to concede my weaknesses because of the stigma I had unconsciously attached to mental illness. It wasn’t until two years ago that I could finally admit to myself a history of chronic depression that went all the way back to my childhood and the obvious obstacles that condition has created in my life.,By the end of the sabbatical year things had become so tense and awful between another elected colleague and me that I was finally motivated to investigate what my rights were. Partly inspired by a behind-the-back labelling of being “mental” I felt obliged to ask the question to myself and other colleagues, “well, what if I am?” what safety nets, procedures, structures are there available for elected officers in times of mental illness?,Leaving this open to interpretation for each elected team to improvise an approach was not an appropriate way to deal with such issues and was/is potentially dangerous. In my experienced head I can now hear the cry of HR managers across the country when I say one of the ways my elected group dealt with me was to sit me down and list all of my foibles, one by one. It was an utterly useless process providing only one constructive criticism and all it achieved was to make me feel more isolated.,So I was determined to see what the score was because I wasn’t vain enough to think I was the only person who had and would go through a similar dilemma.,My brief research highlighted that my union came under charitable law, and many charitable organisations, at the time, voluntarily opted for a Dignity at Work Policy. I was surprised to discover that any such policy, whether adopted by my union or not, would not cover elected officers as they are both heads of a union and employees to the student body. This is politically correct in my view, but it leaves a legal black hole where officers are only informally line-managed by each other.,This presents incredible freedom but, considering the vulnerability damaging life events can place anyone under, as well as the fact that 1 in 4 of us will experience a mental health problem in any given year, it is surely a cruel situation for anyone who really needs a safety net to protect them. Also, the political and public pressure makes it very difficult for officers to seek or create those mechanisms when they are going through deep emotional distress themselves.,Unfortunately, I went through a deep depression after my elected term and felt unable to chase this up on my own. The best I could do was to highlight the issue and propose solutions to the in-coming sabbatical team during the handover.,The Time to Change campaign has really inspired me to finally share my story. I note that the NUS president has signed up to the Time to Change Pledge and I hope this story will bring about some positive change, change which is crucial if student bodies around the country are to continue to inspire and maintain a diverse range of elected officers.,On a happy note, I am still with that partner, nine years later."
,"Last Thursday was A Level results day, and my Twitter feed was packed with people talking about how they felt when they picked up their results, or how they still get anxious at the very thought, even though many years have passed since they were the ones waiting to open that envelope.,There were also plenty of stories about people who didn't get the results they'd hoped for who have still managed to do amazing things, and have fantastic, fulfilling careers and happy lives. These stories are massively important, and I'm very glad that people are sharing them.,I want to tell the story I wish someone had told me six years ago, when I was picking up my own results.,Results day 2007 came five months after I'd experienced what was at that point the worst episode of depression of my life. They'd been cropping up periodically since I was twelve years old, with varying degrees of severity, but March 2007 had been bad to the point that I feared, whilst bumping along down in those black depths, that if things didn't improve I'd never be able to sit my exams or finish my coursework, let alone take up my offer of a place at Cambridge.,At that point, I was a straight-A student. A high achiever. I needed to get those grades, because academic success was the only metric I had by which to judge my own worth as a person. Doing well at school was, as far as I was concerned, the only thing I was good at. I had wholeheartedly bought into a worldview that I barely understood the mechanics of, let alone genuinely believed in. And I had not learnt to read or write or think critically, or to live in the world, or to love - all I'd learnt to do was study.,I got the results I needed, fortunately, and took up my University place six weeks later. And had an even worse depressive episode the following spring. The first one that I truly feared I wouldn't survive, and the one which finally got me on the long and difficult road to adequate treatment, and to learning how to manage my condition as best I could. When I graduated in 2010, I was enjoying the best mental health of my life. I felt for the first time as though I knew how it felt to be normal - how life felt when you lived it without being depressed - and that was a revelation. After years of grinding pessimism, I found to my surprise and delight that I was naturally an optimist.,The time I spent at University was, not at all coincidentally, the only time I didn't perform at the absolutely top of my game academically. Instead of pushing for a First, as some of my supervisors encouraged me to do, I spent my three years at Cambridge experimenting with different medications, taking initial forays into counselling, trying not to drink my feelings and sleep all day, and generally working out how I could live my life with this thing going on in my head in a way that wasn't going to break me or kill me.,So my message for anyone who hasn't got their grades - or who has, and is finding that a few letters on a soulless piece of paper from an exam board still don't solve all their problems - is that this doesn't matter. If you're struggling with mental illness, what matters is taking charge of your health and learning how to live by your own measures in a way that's sustainable. Not being the best at everything because you think it'll finally make you feel worthwhile, or because someone else so desperately wants you to succeed, or because it's the only thing you know how to do.,Instead of chasing the best grades, I spent my time at University learning how to get comfortable in my own skin. I did learn how to read and write and think critically, and I learnt to value myself in contexts which weren't exam-based, and I learnt how to live in the world and how to love. Yes, I still get episodes of depression, but they're much more manageable - because I took the time to learnt to manage them. The years since doing this have been without doubt the happiest and most productive of my life, and I only wish I'd done it sooner. Or even know that I had the option to.,You have the option to. There will always be resits, and other Universities, and a hundred different paths you can take. This is worth putting all of those things on hold for."
,"I’ve had two year-long periods when I was so depressed, so much of the time that life became really hard. The most immediate unhappiness that I felt during those times was loneliness and isolation, because depression puts my barriers up and locks me in behind them.,I was ashamed of being depressed, of not being able to cope with my job / relationship, and of not appreciating everything life has given me – during the first *really bad year* I had a great job with an international NGO in Africa, during the second I lived on a stunningly beautiful beach.,I disliked myself so much that I felt undeserving of anyone else’s attention or empathy, never mind love or understanding.,The most difficult thing was reaching out. Actually, I found it impossible, so I just got lonelier and more depressed.,The moments that made me cry with gratitude later were the handful of times when people just talked to me like normal people talk to each other, when friends or strangers spent time hanging out with me like normal people hang out. Chatting and laughing about anything at all made me feel liked for little while.,It gave me a break from beating myself up for being isolated and unhappy and the buzz of functioning the way happy people do. I had no interest in talking to any of these people about depression, partly because I have problems opening up, but mainly because being unhappy was the absolute last thing I wanted to talk about when I had a rare chance to escape it.,My advice if you have a friend or associate who seems depressed would be, just reach out to them. Don’t feel as though you have to start an awkward or deep conversation, it's enough to be nice. You could show that you’re open to talking if they want to, and that you won’t judge them. What helped me, though, was receiving positive energy and being able to give it in return, simply having the experience of another human being enjoying my company.,I’m in a good place and time in my life at the moment. The guidance I found helped me to accept the energies I was born with (including the tendency to emotional instability that I’ve always despised), think about my positive and negative potential, and understand that we are all on different journeys.,A good friend is at a tough stage of his journey now, and he blames himself mercilessly for not coping. I can’t solve the immediate difficulties in his life, or the deeper issues he has with himself. I can't be his therapist or his life coach, just his friend. I seek him out almost every day, not because I'm worried about him, but because I like being around him.,Positive energy, reassurance that he’s a great person, acknowledgement of his material problems, compliments on everything he does so well, and the chance to vent whatever’s on his mind without being judged all make a visible difference if I find him in a bad way. He also knows that I’ve struggled with depression, and that I feel blessed to have him as my friend, even though he isn’t up all the time."
,"It’s safe to say that my route to becoming a , has had a few stops along the way. A (very) quick insight into my background would be to say that I’ve been living with , and , for the past 8 or 9 years. I don’t say “suffering from” as I feel it gives me a “victim” label, and I refuse to be acknowledged as such. During this time, I’ve seen various health professionals and my end goal has always been to get back into employment.,My most recent counsellor referred me to Imagine Mainstream here in Liverpool to help with cv’s, job searches etc. During my first appointment I was asked if I’d be interested in a Peer Support course that was coming up soon.,For a long time now I’ve wanted to work within mental health but wasn’t sure how to go about it, and so I snapped up the offer without any hesitation! I attended the induction day, was interviewed and was successful.,With apprehension and a bag full of sandwiches and nerves, I started the course. This proved to be one of the best days of my life, as I met people like me and who were totally honest about themselves. I also met the tutors Kieran and Karen.,Their teaching style was relaxed, informative and infectious. It started me thinking about doing something similar within mental health. Throughout the course, Time to Change was mentioned several times by Karen. When the course finished, a few of us kept in touch through various projects with Imagine. We were told of a course that would help us to speak publicly and share our stories, and were asked if we would be interested in attending.,We arrived, and there was Karen again! She began to tell us what the course was about, and also about Time to Change in more depth. We did our “Speaking Out!” training which finished with everyone giving a 2 minute presentation about ,.,Since there was already a relationship of trust built up, we were asked if we were prepared to be filmed giving our presentations. With the trust there, we all agreed. Karen also asked if we would be interested in being Champions and explained what that would entail. We all signed up and did our presentations.,Things kind of snowballed from there. A few of us were asked if we would like to help out with a training session in Blackpool and to also help out at , later in the year. I’d been bitten by the bug and said yes! The session went really well and I even managed to co-facilitate some parts of it.,This has now led me to being a co-facilitator later in the year with someone who’s also gone through the same route for the first independent session without Karen leading it. Yikes!,I suppose the next stage would be to write a blog talking about how I got to where I am now. Hang on, scratch that one off the list!,Illustration by Paul Bainbridge"
,"My close friends are all aware that I experience , and , but, for most of them, that is their limit: simply being aware. Coping, living, and , must be desperately hard. I can only imagine how difficult I can be at times: completely wrapped up in depression and despondent to all those around me.,That's why I'm so grateful for one of my closest friends. I met him this year. He was immediately accepting of the fact that I experience depression, reassuring me that if ever I needed someone to talk to, he would be there. When he said that, I gave an obligatory smile and thanked him – how many times I'd heard that promise, only to be let down.,Soon after, I descended into an episode of depression and ended up taking an overdose. Though I didn't do much physical damage, afterwards I felt very alone. I logged on to Facebook, desperate to talk to friends but also horribly self conscious about telling them what I'd done.,Some people didn't reply to my messages. But this friend did. Without any word of judgement he immediately offered to go to A&E with me, asking if I was OK and why I'd done it. Through all the distress I felt that night, my friend's ability to listen really grounded me.,The next week I returned to Uni. I didn't tell anyone what I'd done, or how I was feeling and, instead, sat through lessons in a lonely silence, feeling completely isolated from everyone else. When I bumped into my friend later, he looked pleased to see me and asked if I was OK. He never mentioned what we'd talked about at the weekend because he didn't have to. He knew the main thing was that I felt like somebody cared and that I knew that I could talk to him if I needed to.,This level of understanding and complete lack of judgement is such a gift. People are so quick to offer their support and help if it's ever needed but can so rarely cope with the heavy realities of mental illness. People who experience depression need to know that they are not alone and that they are allowed to reach out to others for comfort and support.,My friend has continued to support me this year and, the strange thing is, I don't think he realises how much he has helped me. If people were more aware of how such tiny things like a hug or saying hello can really reduce the sense of isolation someone feels, I think the world would be a happier place."

Like many people with mental health issues, my experiences in , about it have been mixed to say the least! However I do definitely believe that things are improving, with greater awareness and understanding, due to sites like Time to Change.,One of the best experiences I’ve had in talking to someone who helped me has been with my mum.,My mum is in her late 60’s and she has always dealt with her own anxiety and life traumas in a very down to earth, ‘let’s just get on with it’ way. Before finding out I was ill, she would angrily talk about how depression didn’t exist in her day and that if anyone had a reason to be depressed, it was her. But when things were bad for me she did her best to listen and to understand, to not judge and to support me in lots of little ways.,What caused this to happen; to let her have her big change of opinion (not an easy thing for my mum!) was in realising that it wasn’t just her daughter being difficult. She discovered that other people were experiencing similar things. One of her neighbours explained to my mum exactly what a panic attack was, as the neighbour’s daughter had been going through the same thing, and told my mum how panic attacks can be completely disabling and frightening.,She came home in a thoughtful mood and, after that, everything changed. My mum’s impatience with me turned into sympathy and a desire to understand me better. Although she still thinks , is a giant mystery that she’ll never entirely fathom, just knowing she’s there and willing to spend time on me is a great help.,I would say that if you can, encourage your nearest and dearest to do their own research into mental health and, more importantly, to not dismiss their findings as not being exactly relevant to you; which I did initially, snapping at my mum that it was different for me (-this was the illness talking, wanting to exclude me from help). At least then you are opening a dialogue, a safe space where you can share any thoughts you’ve been having.,My mum doesn’t magically have all the answers but at least I don’t have to come up with a specific reason when I want to phone her and tell her I’m a bit down. She just listens, chats away about normal things and always leaves me feeling that I’ve left a bit of the pain behind me."
,"Feeling depressed can be a lonely experience and I was no exception.,I felt isolated from the world and couldn’t relate to any of the happiness around me.,People seemed motivated to get out and take part in life and even seemed enthusiastic about it. The idea just didn’t appeal to me at all.,I didn’t want to have to pretend and put on a fake smile. I wanted to wallow at home and sleep as much as I possibly could.,Sleep had become an easy way to escape my ever present misery. Even imagining winning the lottery didn’t pick my spirits up and I spent many dark days wondering if I would ever feel ‘normal’ again.,One thing that really did help was having a friend that knew how I was feeling and was there for me. The support she offered was priceless and it made me realise how important it is to share your thoughts and feelings with others. It opens up a support network that won’t be there unless you are brave enough to reach out to someone.,My friend was patient with me and never used the dreaded words such as, “snap out of it” or “pull yourself together”. She understood that ,. There was no specific reason for my low mood and it couldn’t be related to any specific event in my life.,As a result, it wasn’t something that I could necessarily fix immediately. Her patience meant I didn’t feel pressured into pretending I felt better when I didn’t. She gave me the time to figure it out and be kind to myself instead of heaping guilt on me for not improving quickly enough. Depression has its own time schedule and its own agenda. It is often a matter of ‘riding it out’ and taking life one day at a time rather than doing something specific to stop experiencing it.,It made a huge difference to me just knowing that she was there. I knew I could call on her day or night and it was comforting to know that I could reach her if I felt overwhelmed at times. She never lectured me, ,. I knew that some of my ramblings probably didn’t make sense. Many of my thoughts and words were laden with emotion, rendering them irrational but she just let me get it out of my system.,There were times when she would almost have to drag me out the house as I did have a tendency to want to isolate myself from the world. I used to resent her for this but every time, without fail, I would be glad that I got out for fresh air and a change of scenery. Slowly but surely I began to relate to the happiness around me and began to feel ‘plugged in’ again. My friend had a big part to play in that progress.,Depression can come and go and it can seem as if there is no end in sight but the black cloud does eventually lift. Accept that there will be bad days. Reach out to others and let them know what you are going through. I have been a lot more open and accepting of my struggle with depression in the last few years and I have been amazed at the level of understanding that friends and family have shown me.,Knowing that someone cares and is there to listen has helped me tremendously. Ironically, perhaps I would never have discovered or experienced that level of friendship and support had I not been depressed. It just goes to show that every cloud has a silver lining.,Mandy blogs at "
,"It’s not easy ,. But I know it isn’t easy for my friends or family either.,My mother is my longest and most constant support. From the first moment I was diagnosed to this day, she has had faith. Faith in me.,When she first took me to therapy appointments as a teenager, when I had my ,, when I went from living with anorexia to ,, when I was suicidal, the days I wouldn’t leave the house due to anxiety, the days I wouldn’t leave my bed due to ,- she kept speaking to me, her daughter: the one beneath the mental health issues.,And because she spoke to me, that part of me responded. She kept calling me gently back to who I am and back to my recovery.,Last year I moved to a new city. It was a challenge. This year I have taken on a bigger challenge. After two years performing in a duo I’m taking my debut solo show to the Edinburgh Fringe. It’s also my first year at one of the Fringe’s Top 4 venues; the Gilded Balloon. There has been a lot to handle and at times I haven’t handled it well. It’s been stressful. And stress is a trigger. My body dysmorphia, eating disorders, anxiety, paranoia and obsessive compulsive urges have been harder to manage.,Undeterred, my mother continues to speak to me: the me that made this choice, the me that wrote this show, the me that knows this will pass. She helps by saying she’s proud of me and knows I can get through this. Her faith in me helps me find faith in myself.,When I first moved to this new city, my mental health problems were more manageable: I didn’t have such dramatic symptoms. The friend I live with has found it difficult. But he’s been supportive and willing to learn. My darling mother has given some tips:,“You didn’t cause it, you can’t cure it.” My mother learnt that mantra at one of the clinics I went to. It frees supporters from the guilt that is easy to feel. Mental health is a bit like the safety procedure in an airplane: take care of yourself before taking care of others.,As much as I push him away, the friend I live with has held on. Even when I don’t feel up to it, he encourages me to see my therapist and to see other friends who accept my mental health problems; those that allow me to talk about it freely.,One such friend texts me every so often just to ask how I am. When I’m not up to meeting due to anxiety, he doesn’t take it personally but instead , or to rearrange our meeting. He helps simply by asking if there’s anything he can do to help. Even if he doesn’t know how to help, being willing to is enough.,Most of all, these good friends listen.,Listening can be a powerful tool. Neither my mother nor my friends force me to open up. Sometimes I simply can not. They accept that. But when I do feel ready, they are great listeners. They don’t speak over me, interrupt or tell me what to do. They just listen - often not to the words I say but the way I say them. Usually it is the emotion behind what I am saying that I really need to communicate.,A hug can help a lot too. But sometimes my body dysmorphia is so bad that I can’t bear to be touched. They aren’t offended if I refuse a hug but gently let me know as soon as I’m ready, a hug is waiting.,On particularly bad days, my mother has a secret weapon – the day out! A quiet day with a supportive person when I’m low or anxious helps me focus on the things that deep down I love about life. A walk around some gardens, a visit to a new part of the city, some quiet window-shopping, a trip to the cinema: nothing massively exciting, but a blissful break from my cyclical thoughts.,This month I will perform my debut solo show at the Edinburgh Fringe and the run up to it has been stressful. But I don’t want to back away from it. Because this is life: this is living. And thanks to my friends and family I know I can do this. Thanks to them I can live with mental health problems, which - at times like this - can pose a threat. I can get through it because I’m not alone. And I can never thank them enough for that.,Juliette will perform her new show ‘When I Grow Up’ at the Gilded Balloon at 1.15pm from 31st July to 26th August (not 13th).

,"I used to be terrified of admitting I had a ,. When my dad first mentioned to me that he thought I was , and I should go and see a GP my response was “I don’t want to see any men in white coats”.,At 21 I had quite a negative perception of depression, I didn’t know that 1 in 4 people experienced depression in any given year and I thought having this diagnosis would mean I was crazy.,Although I knew I was struggling to cope with work and I had cut off all my friends, I was still more scared about what people would think of me if they knew that I had depression. Looking back, I’m sure they all knew I was struggling anyway; I was getting into work at 10.30 when I used to arrive at 9.00, and leaving after 7pm every night. I hardly ever left my desk and spent all evening and weekend worrying about work.,When I had to give a presentation my supervisor ended up having to make the slides with me, as I couldn’t function well enough to do it on my own. Looking back I don’t know how I thought that I was successfully hiding my depression and anxiety from everyone but I did manage to get to the end of my placement without admitting to anyone, even myself, that I had a mental health problem.,The next year things got better – I went back to complete my final year at university and I put my unhappy times behind me. I focused on all the reasons that I had been unhappy on my placement year, what I didn’t like about working in the lab and working for a large company, what I found difficult about my boss, and I never really addressed the fact that I had had depression. Looking back it’s not that surprising that my depression came back a few years later.,After I finished a university I decided to move to London and train as a dietitian. In September 2008 things were going well for me. I was settled in London, I had completed an MSc Nutrition and secured a place on the PGDip course at a prestigious university.,When I started to feel depressed again after the first term of the course, I didn’t think people would understand. I didn’t really understand what I had to be depressed about myself. I thought depression was something that happened to people who had been through some significant life event, such as the death of relative or a divorce. If I admitted I was struggling, I thought people would think I was weak or not good enough to be on the course and that I would be asked to leave.,I thought about , but I didn’t think that they would be able to help. When I finally saw a GP it was after the exams, which I didn’t turn up to because I couldn’t concentrate on revising and I was convinced I was going to fail. I went back to my parents’ house to stay for a bit and my dad practically had to force me to see the GP. Even after I had the diagnosis I didn’t want to accept it or take the medication I had been given. I told my parents that the doctor’s questionnaire was wrong and that I didn’t need medication.,Looking back I can see that my fear of talking about depression made things much more difficult for me. I was first diagnosed with depression in 2009 and since then I have got better about talking about it.,I talked to , initially and that was really helpful, as was joining a depression support group. I’ve also seen counsellors through university. It wasn’t easy though and not everyone has been understanding along the way.,I once told my boss I couldn’t make work and I was honest about the reason I couldn’t come in. I got a phone call telling me that I still needed to come in and that everyone was feeling a bit off today. I found that upsetting. This kind of lack of understanding from people has been upsetting to me in the past but at other times my friends have been very understanding.,I think I’m now at a place where I realise that the unhelpful responses reflects more on that person’s understanding and knowledge of depression rather than showing that my depression is “not real” and that I should “pull myself together”. I’ve not had an episode of depression for about 2 years, and I hope I never get depressed again but, if I do, I think not having to worry about hiding my depression from everyone will definitely make it a bit easier to deal with."
,"‘Failed By the NHS’ follows , who, like him, feel that they haven’t received the care they needed for their mental health problems. These young people feel as though GP’s, A&E and the child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) have been unable to offer the support they needed.,I first got , when I was 13. I was self harming, feeling suicidal and had a very poor outlook on life. I went to my GP with my mum, and he referred me to CAMHS. I was immediately given anti depressants, but I also had CBT therapy. Throughout my time with CAMHS I had many ups and downs. The therapist I saw was wonderful. She listened to me like it was more than her job and seemed to have real understanding and compassion.,Unfortunately, despite my helpful therapy, I continued to feel suicidal. When I was around 15 I attempted suicide and was rushed to A&E. I was given the usual blood tests, but I didn’t have a psychiatric assessment. As the documentary stated, 50% of people who present at A&E feeling suicidal or after self-harm don’t receive a psychiatric assessment. Instead, I was taken to a children’s ward for 5 days, where at 15, I was surrounded by babies and toddlers. I felt like they did this as a punishment. The nurses spoke down to me, and made me feel that I was wasting their time. But when mental illness affects 1 in 10 young people, shouldn’t I have been entitled to the same compassionate care as any young person with a physical problem would get?,Over the years, I went to A&E about 5 times with my mental illness. Emma, who featured in the show, says that she had been to A&E 6 or 7 times for self harm injuries. Each time they tended to her physical wounds, but she never received a psychiatric assessment. (A doctor who featured in the show said “not having access to psychiatrists in A&E can be a matter of life or death.”,Even if people were receiving proper assessments in A&E, the waiting times are still hugely disappointing. In the show we hear the tragic story of Chris Ferrin, who once waited 8 hours in A&E. He begged for help but after such a long wait, he frantically fled. 5 days after going to A&E and not receiving help, he was found dead. His family are still devastated by his death, but also incredibly angry at the injustice their son faced.,The show talks a lot about the young peoples experiences of ,. Aged 18, Jonny spoke to a GP and despite his doctor being aware of his suicidal thoughts, he was simply recommended to get regular exercise and to eat healthier food. Nick was initially prescribed 20mg of Fluoxetine a day when he was aged 13 to treat depression and the symptoms of OCD. A year ago, he was prescribed three times the original dosage without being warned about the possible side effects.,One of the problems young people can face in speaking to their GP is that they have a very short time to really explain their thoughts and feelings, which often they don’t fully understand themselves. Over the years, I have been on many kinds of psychiatric medications. Through taking one particular type, I started to lose my hair and my periods completely stopped. I was never warned that such severe things could happen.,Norman Lamb, Minister of State for Care & Support, says in the documentary that GP’s are not trained adequately in mental health problems, and that there is not sufficient understanding. He proposes the helpful suggestion that GP’s take an extra years training, which would include ,.,When I got to the age of 16, I was feeling a lot happier, but still taking medication. It was decided that I would be discharged from CAMHS. Like Kimberley, who had anxiety and depression, when she got discharged from child services, she wasn’t aware that an adult service existed. There seems a huge gap between the 2 services, and very little communication between them and about it. Chloe who has bipolar disorder was given an appointment with CAMHS 4 days after her 18th birthday. When she attended, she was told she couldn’t be seen. She had to beg them for help. A study in London found that shockingly, only 4% of people felt happy with the transition from child to adult services. For myself, it took my depression to worsen and lose my job before I could access adult services at 17.,I was really pleased that the show dedicated time to explain mindfulness and its benefits in helping with mental health problems. I was lucky enough to be offered Dialectical behavioural therapy, which features a lot of mindfulness. It helped me immensely and I would even say it saved my life.,Mental illness is so common, that the chances are that 1 in 4 adults will experience some form of it. I believe that, with the work that Time to Change do, we need to continue to talk about mental illness."
,"This week, I was caught off guard by an unlikely conversation. It happened before a yoga class when I asked the manager how often she practiced. Without saying a word, she gracefully pointed to a freshly applied tattoo.,My awe and wonder grew as she explained the significance of her blown-up, pixilated love heart: not only was it the visual representation of an extra life in one of her favourite computer games but it was also one half of her husband’s corresponding tattoo that also denoted an extra life - “1UP” – in the Super Mario Bros video game.,This insight prompted a stark realisation – like one of those unusual moments when all the pieces of your favourite jigsaw puzzle finally slot together. These permanently etched depictions signified that somewhere along the journey there is the possibility of finding so much love and happiness that one life is not enough: you want another one.,That’s when it struck me. When I realised how ill I had become. It was as if someone had pressed the rewind button: all of a sudden I was taken back to the time when I first fell ill. When I didn’t understand what was wrong: Why couldn’t I stop crying? Why could I not sleep? At what point had the line between perceived normality and seeming madness blurred and merged into one? Friends looked perplexed; colleagues didn’t know what to say; my family sent me to the doctor. It was this very same practitioner, who, without any qualm stated: “You are suffering from severe ,.”,Then I was brought back to reality: how on earth, I wondered, while looking at the tattoos, could anyone want another life?,There’s something about mental illness that seems to send a shiver down everyone’s spine. A taboo: something that happens to ‘other people’: something that is only ever discussed in whispers, as if it were contagious. Most of the time I think this is because people don’t understand it – don’t really know what it means to suffer from mental ailments. But, sometimes I wonder if it’s because we’re actually scared of it: we’re all worried that, if by some slim chance, by talking about it we might also become prey to it.,Take a holiday! Move country! Find a partner! - they suggest, half-heartedly, half-confused. But the sad reality is that however great the holiday, however pretty the change of scenery, however devoted your new lover, you still – at some point – have to come back to you.,Any that could mean any of us. We all have mental health – just as we all have physical health. Mental ailments come in as many disguises as they do forms and degrees. Indeed, an estimated , will experience a mental health problem in any given year – so why are we so afraid to speak-up and talk about it? Why are we so rejecting about something that is already so negative?,When I fell ill, someone wisely pointed out that it wasn’t as much a ‘breakdown’ as it was a ‘breakthrough’. This was my body’s way of telling me that something wasn’t right – that something needed to change. And I’m not talking about a complete overhaul. I’m talking about making small incremental shifts that will – collectively – make a big difference over the long run.,It’s talking about introducing flexibility in the way we think about the world and how we think about ourselves. It’s about self-acceptance; fallibility; realism. It’s knowing that it’s nice to have people’s love and approval, but understanding that without it – we can still love, respect and enjoy ourselves. It’s remembering that doing things well is satisfying but knowing that it’s human – and important – to make mistakes. It’s understanding that people are going to act the way they want – not the way we want. And most importantly: it’s believing that if we take the right steps, we won’t be ill forever, we can get better.,I truly believe that we can only embrace something once we’ve fully understood and accepted it. So perhaps, if we were all , then it wouldn’t be such a frightening and isolating experience. In a weird and wonderful way, we might also start to embrace the pros – and not just the cons – of this emotional roller coaster. Perhaps then, we’d see more people walking around with tattoos symbolising their wish to live this – and the next – life to the absolute full."
,"Josh and I became friends instantly. We met on the first day of university and, since we shared a similar sense of humour, we managed to find even the most mundane tasks incredibly enjoyable.,It’s not often you meet someone you get along with so well straight away; it was effortless. As you can imagine, we did everything together.,When my mental health seriously began to deteriorate I wasn’t sure exactly how to tell him that there was something wrong. Our friendship was based on ‘not taking life too seriously’.,We were always laughing and joking; how much would this change our friendship? I was empty, vacant, a shadow of my former self. I was petrified he wouldn’t want to be friends with me anymore; maybe he’d think it wasn’t worth the hassle?,""The doctor says I’m suffering with ,and ,,"" I said.,Josh was quiet for a long time. Eventually he took a deep breath, smiled and said, “It’ll be okay.”,He wasn’t being dismissive. I could see that he understood; his eyes were wide and reassuring. From that moment on Josh has always been there for me. Sometimes, when I’d be feeling a bit better, we’d go to the cinema, travel together and spend evenings out with friends. Often though, when I couldn’t face the world, I’ve always had someone there to keep me company.,It must have been difficult to live with someone so unpredictable and moody but, for the entire time we’ve known each other, Josh has never questioned my actions or made me feel guilty for the way I am. I feel so fortunate that I’ve always had someone there who was just willing to listen. I don’t want advice, I don’t want an opinion and I don’t want to be judged. All I need is someone who is willing to listen to me.,Perhaps most crucially, I’m grateful for his unnatural patience. Five years later and having since been diagnosed with ,, Josh is still a vital part of my life and, most importantly, my recovery. He is proof that I am capable of making and maintaining friendships and that, despite my illness, I am worth the effort.,He will still sit up with me until the early hours of the morning if I can’t sleep, he doesn’t expect me to feign a smile when I’m feeling low and, when I’m too anxious to leave the house, he completely understands.,I find , daunting. Will they understand? Will they reject me? Will they think of me differently? If people care enough about me they will listen, will endeavour to support me when I feel that I can’t support myself and will accept me and love me for who I am. I don’t know when I’ll be better but I can’t describe how much it has meant to me to have a friend like Josh.,And I’m sure he’ll agree with me; there have been some bad times but there have been some very good times too..."
,"I first experienced ,when I was 16 and still at school. I remember the exact moment when I heard “my friends” talk to me through my speakers. They were saying great stuff about how awesome I was.,With thinking that I had my friends in my head I did begin to panic, I thought this isn’t right I don’t want people hearing my thoughts and taking away my whole privacy.,After I first heard those voices they began to manifest as voices of my friends and passers-by. The voices began to dislike me and everything I said was wrong and that I was a bitch and an evil person.,I began to feel lost and alone wherever I was and if I didn’t catch something one of my friends would say I would hear them insulting me instead. I started to think that everyone secretly hated me and just wouldn’t tell me to my face so I decided to act the same way back. This resulted in me losing all my friends.,After school ended I tried to cope the best I could with hearing these voices and losing my friends. I drank to cope with the hurt. My family did notice something was seriously wrong and took me to see a young peoples’ psychologist. Where I met a woman who seemed to have only dealt with bullying but was at the local psychiatric hospital. I tried so hard to tell her what I was experiencing but couldn’t with the fear of having people judging me, as that was what I was lead to believe would happen if I spoke out.,The young people’s councillor told me that I was drinking too much and this could be a reason as to why I had felt people were talking about me and asked me to write a drink diary. I thought this was my chance to show her what I was going through and I wrote down my drinking intake into my diary, where I had also written about everything that I had gone through with hearing these voices in the past year.,After I gave it to her, I had to wait until the next session to find out her thoughts on it all and I was so nervous. Finally the days passed and I got to see what she thought and she clearly didn’t read any of it as she said to me “look your drinking is really bad but you’re a pretty girl I don’t see why you have any problems”. That was it! This sent me into a spiral of ,.,My parents had tried to seek help for me but the only answers we got were that I was becoming an alcoholic that I was a spoilt daughter. I eventually turned to my mum for help after giving myself third degree burns whilst trying to make pasta drunk one night. She took me straight to the doctor.,I told the doctor about hearing voices and was given an appointment straight away with a psychiatric doctor. He told me I had an illness known as psychosis, with a chemical imbalance in my brain making me experience hallucinations.,I have never been so relieved in all my life to know that there was something wrong and that people didn’t actually hate me. I didn’t care that I was now labelled with this illness just the feeling of relief that it wasn’t all real was so great. I did wish I was diagnosed when I first met the young people’s psychologist because that set me back a few years and did endanger my life. We did put a complaint in about that woman but that didn’t change how I felt. The next few weeks I still heard the voices but I was so happy not to be scared anymore.,I became a changed person after my diagnosis, I stopped keeping it all to myself and told my family all what I had been experiencing. I got my life back and learned ways to cope and adapt to the voices which is basically to tell them how they’re wrong and that they are just trying to bring me down.,I am now doing really well after a lot of self-analysing and taking medication, I am now being able to go to work part time. I sometimes try to look back at how I felt when I was 16 but I do find it difficult because I have blocked a lot of horrific memories but I am so happy within myself and how I am now leading a normal life."
,"On a warm summer Saturday, I had my first experience of visiting a secure hospital caring for people with mental illness. I arrived by taxi with Angela, the South East Regional Coordinator for ,, such as myself.,As we walked into reception, I felt like I might be checking in myself and tried to imagine what the process of entering the world of a secure hospital may be like.,I was a little nervous entering the hospital at first. I had been treated as an outpatient by the same organisation in the past for my own ,, , and ,.,Before attending my first outpatient appointment, I wondered what that centre might be like. On both occasions I had images in my head and horror stories from the news and expressed in films. As an outpatient, I hardly saw any other patients. But my visit to the hospital on that Saturday would of course be very different.,This was my first experience of representing and supporting Time to Change as a Champion, although I have previously represented Mind at an event and participated in a Half Marathon for the same organisation.,Our purpose for visiting the hospital was to raise awareness of the Time to Change campaign to , and provide people with the opportunity to support our work and build their confidence and self-esteem at the same time.,The Saturday was an annual ‘Carers’ Day’ at the hospital. Although carers have the opportunity to attend regular meetings at the hospital, many have to travel such long distances that they simply can’t often meet fellow carers and support staff. In a conversation with one carer, I was told how important it was to have a larger annual gathering such as this where a greater number of carers can come together, share their experiences, and feel cared for themselves.,This was an important message from the day – carers need to be cared for too! Because of course the work of carers is invaluable to the wellbeing of the patient and yet carers could be struggling with their own mental health difficulties. Angela likened this to flight attendants in an emergency. If passengers are in danger, and the oxygen masks are deployed, flight attendants must first look after themselves. Why? Because once the flight attendants are safe they will then be in the best position to be able to look after the passengers.,After leaving all of our possessions in lockers at the entrance, we entered through secure doors and were led through corridors and further secure doors to a meeting room. Despite my slight nervousness at all this security, the hospital neither felt like a hospital nor anything like a prison. Although I didn’t see the patients’ rooms, the perception I had of the hospital was of a smart, modern, clean, and minimalist environment, designed to feel as warm and friendly as possible.,The presentation given by Angela was my first chance to see the Time to Change campaign delivered in this way. It was an opportunity for me to see the presentation, in the hope that I may deliver it myself some day. Another take home message from the day was that personal stories and anecdotes are often what are remembered most fondly from these presentations.,After the presentation we had a chance to grab a very quick drink and biscuit. Thirsty, I headed straight for this and used it as an opportunity to strike up my first conversation. My opening gambit with the first person I saw was “So had you heard of Time to Change before this presentation?”,I was so glad I felt confident enough to do this because not only had this lovely man not heard of Time to Change, but he later confessed to being the “quiet or shy one” and perhaps would not have instigated his own conservation with us. He had the confidence to tell me a little about his story as a carer and the story of his son who is a patient at the hospital. He was very pleased to hear that an organisation has taken on the role of tackling mental health stigma.,Finally, we were taken to the hospital’s gym, which is a great space with lots of equipment and a badminton court in the centre – my favourite sport! The carers had an opportunity to experience a counseling and sharing session of their own. One of the key messages that came out of this was the vital role of volunteers in the mental health support and campaigning field.,One man passionately explained his belief that everyone has a duty to give something back by volunteering his or her time. Of course, not everyone is in the position to do this. However, I for one feel able to (most of the time) support the work of mental health charities. With lived experience myself, I understand the importance of the work of these organisations and believe I can and should give something back by sharing my story. Hopefully, my stories and future blogs will resonate with or help at least one person. If it does, I’ll deem my work a success!,The experience at the secure mental health hospital was an uplifting one. I hope and believe that it provided carers with an opportunity to get together, feel supported, and to express themselves. For me, I left feeling more confident in telling my own story and with a sense of satisfaction for being a part of the ‘Carers’ Day’."
,"In January of this year I was sent an e-mail about ,, exploring young people's experiences of living with a mental health disorder.,Did I want to be put forward, the e-mail said. I stared long and hard at the description, wondering whether this would be the right thing to do.,Could I go on television and talk about my agoraphobia, , and ,? What if it was edited to make me look silly? How would I cope with people talking about what they had seen of me on TV? What would my boyfriend think, and my friends and family? I typed in 'Go for it' and hit reply.,Within an hour I was on the phone to Sarah from Firecracker Films, who wanted to ask me a couple of questions about my mental health disorder, and why I wanted to take part. It didn't feel like an interview, it felt like a chat with a friend who I had known for years.,She instantly put me at ease and I knew this was the right thing to do. I was told to use my phone's camera to answer some interview questions that they would send me, to possibly be included in the programme. I never thought in a million years that my answers would impress or excite, but Sarah called me back practically as soon as I sent the interview over. “Please do some more filming for us, we'd love to see the rest of your story.”,I was given the support of the whole production team (Emily, Sam and Sarah), as well as a psychologist named Howie, who is a star! He made sure I knew what I was getting myself into and gave me some tips to protect myself whilst the show was aired. I felt good and I instantly started filming whenever and wherever I could. All of my friends, family and my boyfriend, Jake, were really supportive. They offered to help me film, even during my worst moments.,I turned the camera into my own personal therapy sessions, picking it up whenever I felt extremely low or even when I was happy about something that had happened. It felt good to talk to someone, even though there technically wasn't anyone watching (yet).,The videos were sent to Firecracker Films on memory sticks or via the internet, whenever I had built up enough filming to send over. It was about 3 months in total before I had some tough times at home and decided that I would have to take a break from filming. The team were extremely understanding and assured me that I had done a great job. Sam and Emily came over around a month after that, to show me the film.,From practically the first scene I felt tears welling up in my eyes. All of these men and women were the same as me, talking about their experiences and trying to help break down the ,. Everyones' stories were completely different, yet similar at the same time. We had all suffered, we were all trying to do something about it and we all wanted to get the word out that it is 'okay to talk'.,The adverts started airing last Wednesday (10th July) and then it began to sink in what I was doing. I was going to be on national television, talking about my problems and being seen at my worst. Suddenly, I got a friend request from another one of the participants on Facebook, then another and another. We formed our own little community, where we could talk about our worries and our excitement. Jessica, Kiera-Rose, Abby, Sophie, Tilly and myself. I asked some of them what they thought about filming the programme and was pleased to know that we all had the same thoughts.,“At several points, I did wonder if I was doing the right thing by letting the world see my personal life - but I knew I had to - spreading the awareness of this disorder and of mental health was so important to me.” Jessica, told me. I felt the same, this was so important. What we were doing was important!,“It's scary putting myself and my story out there, the real me in probably my most vulnerable state, but I want people to understand what it's REALLY like to suffer with the illness.” said Tilly. I was glad that we were all in it for the same reason. We all knew that now is the time to talk.,I'm so glad that we had this opportunity to film our lives and to talk about our mental health disorders, and that I got the opportunity to become friends with some of the other contributors who are all beautiful, inside and out. I hope that people will watch the programme and get something from it; whether that be hope, understanding or something even more. I hope that more people will take this as an opportunity to stand up and talk about mental health, without being afraid.,You can catch , Wednesday 17th July, 9pm on BBC 3. We hope this helps you, as much as it as helped us."
,"Ironic. No, nothing to do with Alanis Morrisette and her song, but to do with the documentary ‘,’.,What is ironic, is that I am sat here worrying about what people will think of me, how people will react to what I say and what I do, when the whole point of me participating in the documentary was to document my anxiety which at times can become quite crippling.,Whilst I filmed myself for the documentary, I was in a stage of recovery from , and anxiety, but more so the former. I am fortunate in that I have come a long way and am fighting to be free of the shackles of ,, but have come out of a place where I suffered from depression.,The reason I agreed to take part in the documentary, to film my life and how living with anxiety and depression affected me and to an extent, still does affect me, was because I want to make a difference and break down the stigma surrounding living with a mental health issue. Not everyone is the same, and there are certainly some disheartening ,.,I feel that I learnt a lot from filming myself and thinking about how my mental health issues affect my life. They are significant enough to be noticeable, impacting upon my relationships with people the most, and in some cases preventing me from going out and socialising or from doing some of the things that I want to do. It can get overwhelming and frustrating at times, because with my anxiety I overthink things to such an extent that I even overthink, overthinking. I feel that this will be portrayed in the documentary with some of the things I discuss, because it is evident that there are so many thoughts racing around my head that it becomes difficult to deal with.,I’m interested to see how my friends react to seeing the documentary and me discussing the things that go through my mind. Some of them will be especially interested because they have similar experiences, and I don’t feel that I will be judged in any way by any of my friends.,Despite this, I have a fear that some people will see the title and immediately assume that everyone in the programme is abnormal in some way and will either take that judgement into the programme, or not watch the programme at all and carry that idea through with regards to people with mental health issues. Furthermore, I feel as though, having seen some of the clips of other people discussing their mental health, that my contribution was somehow of less importance to the programme, or that people will compare me to the other people in the documentary and as a result make some sort of judgement on me.,Overall, however, I feel OK about the documentary. There are of course some fears which I have discussed, but if I wasn’t comfortable with it then I wouldn’t have participated. Finally though, I am looking forward to it because it will help me to see that I have achieved a lot since the documentary was filmed, and also that I have conquered most of my issues and am well on the way to recovery.,I wanted to show people that it’s OK to ,, and by participating in the documentary I felt like I was able to do that on a broader scale than I currently do. It’s important that people can talk out about how they feel, and if more people do that, then stigma which surrounds mental health can be reduced and hopefully eradicated over time."
,"No, you're right I don't look depressed. That's because I'm not depressed at the moment. I do live with depression and I have for all of my adult life. It doesn't mean that I spend my days with a face akin to Melpomene (muse of tragedy).,I'm not sure if I'm expected to wear a badge or possibly bells to indicate that I'm a depressive?,I'm asking because some people don't realise that , and , don't discriminate. It can and does happen to everyone. We are powerless to stop it. Our power lies with how we deal with it.,Yes, when I'm depressed I struggle to function. It has been for me, a completely paralysing experience, but with the right support, and sometimes the right medication I can get through the paralysis.,My worst experiences with depression have been when I've felt that I had to hide my depression.,When I was 21 I was going through a very rough patch, and had been off work, told to go home by my boss whilst having a breakdown in the middle of St Anne's Square in Manchester.,As I sat frozen in the city centre whilst my boyfriend went to summon help in the form of my boss, I spotted someone I knew. I have never moved so quickly. I didn't want anyone to see the mess that I was in, terrified that someone would ask ""what's the matter"" as my answer was simply ""I don't know"". Signed off sick and taken to a football match to cheer me up, it got worse when a colleague spotted us ""Hi! I haven't seen you in work for ages"" was his greeting. ""My back, I have a bad back"" was my lame and hurried response.,Hiding has only ever made things worse. I still get stressed when it comes to my medical history on job applications, why should I declare that at 15, 21, 24, 25... (you get the idea) I had depression and felt that things were beyond repair? Having to tell my current boss that I needed to see my GP and that it needed my GP because he understands. There are very few illnesses that require that conversation.,The same boss who told me that I needed to put my ""game face"" on at work. The best feeling happened last week when I felt I could say to my colleague, ""my mood has slipped"" and to know that we didn't need to say anything else. Feeling as though you have some kind of dirty secret is an awful thing, we shouldn't be frightened because we know how to deal with it.,I know when , and I know when all I need is sleep. I have dealt with my depressive side now for so long that it no longer frightens me. Yes, there are times when I wish I was someone else, and on rare occasions when I have considered and planned for not being able to stay. But if I hang on and do what I need to do then things settle, the paralysis lifts and I can move. I feel like I can never explain, to family or friends, why their love and support doesn't override the depression. To talk about it would feel like the ultimate insult to everything they have done. I can't help it so I don't say it.,I'm a member of a club that no-one wants membership of, yet we can be the kindest, loveliest, most articulate people you could meet (we can be the complete opposite so let's not get excited).I don't need you to understand, I just need you not to judge."
,"The third and final episode of ‘Don’t Call Me Crazy’, part of ‘,, aired last night documenting the plight of patients on the McGuiness unit in Manchester.,The series has followed a range of people with varying mental health illnesses from , and an , to , and ,.,The McGuiness unit is one of many adolescent units across the country that provides specialist care with an acute wing for patients who are most distressed.,Last night’s episode focused on two males, both hearing voices, who had been admitted to the ward.,As a young person who has suffered mental illnesses such as depression, anorexia and self-harm I have been gripped from the first episode.,During my teenage years I was also crippled by my illnesses and was admitted to a specialist unit specifically for eating disorders. Initially I felt triggered and uneasy about what the programme was actually trying to achieve. I feared it wasn’t showing young people with mental health difficulties in a very good light. But after viewing the 3 part documentary I think it has been successful in revealing how life can be like if you suffer from a mental illness. How symptoms vary with each illness and how it affects people’s lives., and 3500 young people will be admitted to units each year. The documentary aims to reveal what it is like ‘on the inside’ and how the 9 in 10 young people perceive the young people on the inside.,Last night’s episode focused on young men with mental health problems. There is , as they are less likely to seek help and will often get to a crisis point. At the McGuiness unit there are 2 girls to every boy.,Matty, a 17 year old admitted with severe depression and psychotic episodes, hears voices that tell him he will be killed on his 18th birthday. The voices have become so severe and damaging that he has attempted suicide.,Another male who was admitted was George, a 16 year old rugby player also with severe depression. George’s dad travelled to the McGuiness unit from Essex as George has a scholarship at a boarding school in Cumbria following his passion of rugby. The programme shows it’s not just someone who experiences mental illness that are affected it is the family and friends who are also affected by it, seeing loved ones at the point of despair they want to take their own lives is very distressing.,The ward implements varying therapies to help patients. Group therapy aims to engage patients through art or dance to explore their thoughts and feelings. The programme also shows how they review the patient’s mental health state, as and when to give them home leave for integration with the triggering ‘outside world’.,I don’t think ‘Dont Call Me Crazy’ could have survived as a one off documentary, and speaking to a friend we agree how important it is to see that life is not all doom and gloom people can leave the ward relatively happy and stable.,The series for me has highlighted how sporadic and different mental health services are across the country. What I would like to see is follow on episodes with care in the community with CMHT or a programme highlighting the difficulty of transition between child and adolescent services to adult services as Matty experienced. I find these are the key areas mental health care in Britain, where it’s most flawed and needs serious attention - the work in these units can be quickly undone as soon as young people are discharged, or before admittance to a unit.,To conclude ‘Don’t Call Me Crazy’ is very poignant. Breaking down the ‘them and us’ mentality and changing the stereotypes is crucial to end stigma and discrimination amongst young people. ,, we are ill not crazy. We are unwell just like a broken hand that can be temporary or diabetes that will remain with us for the rest of our lives but can be monitored and controlled. As Beth from the documentary said: “Why hide something that makes me unique”."
,"I have been gathering research for the past week or so on what people actually think about depression as an illness. I was shocked, upset and almost angry at what I saw amongst some social networking sites and forums.,I am generally an open-minded person. I will respect peoples’ opinions on subject matters as long as they are fully educated in it. However, it was clear from what I read on these sites that some people have not done their research. In this instance, the subject matter was , and ,, and individuals were throwing around insensitive and insulting comments for the public to see.,Having probably started self-harming at fourteen, experiencing depressive and suicidal thoughts when I came into high school, and being finally diagnosed with severe depression at fifteen, I think I probably know enough about depression as an illness to make a comment on it now I am nineteen.,Depression is perfectly real. In my opinion, it is unusual to not be able to get out of bed in the morning. And no, this is not because we are ‘lazy’. We physically cannot find the motivation/drive/point in facing the day, we cannot bare to face the world because that is how low we feel. You feel so low that you are almost a magnet, your body and your mind will not allow you to face the day so will keep you in bed to sleep, to hope the day passes quickly and painlessly. Curled up in a ball, trying to drown out the thoughts swimming in your head, but they will not leave you alone, and you are crying yourself to sleep again before you have even had a chance to wake up properly.,Obviously everyone will have very different experiences but this is how I feel, and I am sure many other people are in the same boat as myself.,Back to the matter at hand, I thought I would share some of what I found, and highlight the importance of removing this stigma and ignorance that certain people have with depression.,I came across a picture on Facebook, and these comments were in the thread. I warn you that some people may find these upsetting:,“If you’re willing to let a few words cause this kind of self-abuse, no one is to blame but yourself... People die every day. Why should I feel any pity for those who are selfish enough to take their own lives for no good reason?”,“Cutting or suicide is a wimpy way to deal with that stuff.”,“Cutting yourself is stupid. You’re only inflicting more hurt and pain on yourself, it makes no sense to me.”,Pretty harsh things were said in that one thread on Facebook. Though one thing I am glad of, is that the last individual admitted it “made no sense” to them. This should give us a reason to start these conversations today. To remove this negativity surrounding self-harm and depression, and educate individuals like these who do not seem to know anything about the subject.,In my opinion, depression is not an illness that shows you are weak. In fact, I believe it is the complete opposite. I believe depression to be the illness of the strong. The things depressives go through in day to day life could make us almost superhuman, our thoughts will affect us physically, as well as mentally but we will still soldier through our lives.,If we all work together, we can battle this stigma and discrimination for at least future generations if not out own. These kinds of comments are not right, I understand that people will not fully be able to empathise with depressives as they have not gone through it themselves, but there is really no need to throw around insulting comments in public like that. If we all start one conversation, maybe we can change at least one person’s opinion on mental health."
,"I was first diagnosed with , and , when I was 19 but by that time I had already been dealing with mental illness for many years.,These days there’s a lot more help and supported aimed at young people with mental illness, which is great. I can only hope this will lessen the chance of it being missed for such a long time in others.,I remember hurting myself when I was just seven years old. I would frequently retreat into fantasy at that age too, to the point that I wasn’t always aware what was real and what wasn’t.,At the time this was put down to me having an over-active imagination. After a while, I stopped talking about my ‘other lives’ as I became more aware that this wasn’t normal behaviour.,At the age of ten I contemplated suicide for the first time, though I didn’t know the word back then. I only knew that I was unhappy and this seemed a way to end that unhappiness. By eleven I had started to develop disordered eating habits and my self-harming behaviour began to increase. By thirteen I was self-harming almost daily and had moved from contemplating suicide to attempting it.,At 14 I was referred to the school counsellor, I only went once and there was no follow up. At 15 I finally spoke to somebody of my own volition about what was going on. I told my primary care giver about my , and my self-harm. They tried to be supportive but clearly didn’t know what to do. It wasn’t until I was 18 that I spoke to her again. This time she suggested I go to the doctor. I did and was referred to counselling, but I only went three times and again there was no follow up.,At 19 I had a serious melt down and finally my mental illness became visible to those around me. I dropped out of university. I was underweight, refusing to eat and scared to leave the house. One of my housemates went with me to the GP and I finally started the long road to recovery.,My decision to talk to my housemate wasn’t taken easily. In the past, on the rare occasions I’d tried to open up I’d been met with scepticism or fear and an inability to offer me the support I needed. I didn’t know how to start a conversation about my mental health but in the end I didn’t need to. I had a major panic attack about going out to the shop, just to pick up some milk so we could have tea. My housemate ran out, got the milk, made us both a cuppa then sat down with me in the living room and asked how he could help.,I was afraid at first – was I so crazy now that it was visible for everyone to see? Was he going to suggest I move out, as he had had enough of my often odd behaviour? I burst into tears and found myself unable to really talk at first. My housemate was amazing. He told me it was OK if I didn’t want to talk about it. He just wanted me to know that he was there if I wanted to, that he had been worried about me for a while and wanted to help in any way he could.,His understanding and patience made it possible for me to calm down enough to talk. It was a conversation that went on for hours and by the end of the it he was reassuring me that I wasn’t crazy and that I could be helped. It was him who suggested I go to the doctor and he offered to come with me., was difficult. I was worried that I would be told there was nothing wrong with me, or that she would think I was beyond help. She remained calm throughout but she kept asking me why I thought I was like this and that was a question I had no answer for. In the end she seemed a little frustrated that I couldn’t answer her questions but she did offer me medication and we discussed the possibility of a referral to local mental health services.,I walked away with a prescription for anti-depressants and an appointment for two weeks later so that she could see how I was getting on. Two weeks later I was referred for a mental health assessment, which was a relief. My doctor was efficient and pro-active when it came to my treatment but she didn’t seem able to understand why I couldn’t just pull myself together. I think the whole situation would have been easier for me if she had been more sympathetic but she did take things seriously enough to help me access the right support. In the end, that was what mattered.,I am so grateful for the support of my housemate. Without him, I don’t think I would have even made an appointment with my doctor. Without his encouragement I doubt I would have gone back for that second appointment. I was lucky to have a friend like him with me because my doctor’s lack of sympathy was hard to deal with at first. Now I think that she was simply trying to keep a professional distance and it worked out well because I got the help I needed. I wonder though if a friendlier approach might not have worked better – particularly for those who don’t have a housemate or friend like I did prepared to go with them.,It’s been 14 years since then and I’m still far from healthy but things have improved so much. I have bad days, sometimes bad weeks or months but I have good ones too. I’m so much better at recognising when I need extra support and I’ve learned to , instead of hide it.,Looking back, it’s clear that people did realise there was something wrong when I was growing up. I’ve certainly had many a long chat with my guardian since reaching adulthood. I now know that she was very worried about me but was no more equipped to talk about it than I was. She saw the signs but didn’t really know what they meant or how to help.,This is why I’m so glad that there are so many services now aimed at young people, because being listened to, supported and helped along the path to recovery makes all the difference and the sooner you can have that the sooner you can start on the path."
,"Perception is a funny thing... And “funny” is a strange thing to perceive. As a comedy writer and performer I like making fun of things that I feel angered or frightened by. Perceptions can both anger and frighten me...,I have acute body dysmorphia and a lifelong struggle with various ,, , and ,. Because of this, I often can't trust my perception of myself, my body or sometimes the world around me. My perception can be distorted; it caused me to believe I had to lose weight when I was a month away from dying from starvation. When I was sectioned for anorexia I had a ,; the hallucinations I experienced during that episode challenged my perception of the world around me powerfully.,Over the years I've learnt how to accept my mental health problems – I’m still learning. Honesty has been a huge part of this; the more honest I've been about my illnesses, the more I've learnt; the more I've met other people like me on a path of recovery; the more I've met people who've accepted me as I am; the more I've accepted myself and the realities of living with my problems. Thanks to the kind people who know to treat me no differently – the people who see me and not my illness - I'm learning to do the same.,This honesty is now fuelling my comedy; I started to address my mental health problems in my shows. I want to be open about all my experiences to challenge the wider perception of mental health problems. I want to be a part of this much-needed dialogue. People want to , now, it's no longer something to keep quiet about.,Nowhere did I see this more clearly than in the response to a recent press interview. In a wonderfully , I opened up more than ever before about my psychosis, my eating disorders and my experience of being sectioned.,As I walked away from talking with John it suddenly struck me – what would people think?! My friends, my family and the public; what if they thought I was a crazy nutcase?! Because, well, you know, I AM! I needn't have worried, the response was overwhelmingly positive. Sure, some of my friends didn't comment but some friends said they were reminded that I'm a “tough cookie” (food pun intended I hope!).,On , I gained many new followers and people tweeted me to share their stories. It was like having a verbal hug every time I received a new message: “It's great to have such strong voices speaking out”, “Thank you for your honesty and integrity”, “You have to have the darkness to appreciate the light”. Someone even quoted me in a tweet to Stephen Fry (one of my heroes!) and one lovely new Twitter follower told me that, having just been discharged from his psychiatric nurse, reading my interview gave him hope. I felt so blessed and excited to hear from him – in a small way I'd help him feel less alone at a time when loneliness could be a very real threat.,My family's response to the interview was…British. With their stiff upper lip fully starched they remained on the fence; those closest to me often appear concerned that by being so open in interviews or in my shows I risk being vulnerable. They’ve seen that my mental health issues can take me down a dark and dangerous road of isolation. And they fear some people's perception of mental health issues might mean I'm isolated once more. But I have emphatically decided that being vulnerable is a good thing.,Vulnerability is frightening, but it's also honest. Honesty is real. And facing up to reality is a part of recovery. It might be frightening, to me and to others, but I want to be brave. It then opens up that dialogue and welcomes other people to do the same.,If some don't want their perception of people, like me, with mental health issues challenged, that is their choice. But for every one person like that there are more who are open-minded enough to listen to my experiences and change their perception by becoming more informed. And there are the , who might just see my openness as an invitation to feel less isolated themselves.,I still struggle daily with my mental health problems; my perception of myself, my body and the world around me. But perception is a very funny thing.

,"I have a confession to make. I pull my hair out. Voluntarily. To the point where I have a bald patch.,Why on earth would you do that, you ask? Well, have you ever bitten your nails or picked at a spot? It's like that; the sensation produces a strange comfort – one that's easy to get addicted to.,It started when I was a teenager, and has got worse, prompting me to break down and finally seek help after almost a decade of living with the condition.,The technical term for my condition is trichotillomania. It took a while to admit to myself I had it, let alone anyone else. It was only when I gave myself a bald patch that I told my family, and that was only last year. To this day, I haven't even admitted it to some of my closest friends, even though they know everything else about me. Why? Because it's embarrassing. I used to enjoy going to the hairdressers, and now I dread it as I have to explain why my hair is the way it is.,It may sound ridiculous, or silly. You may think “why don't you just stop?” Believe me, if I could that easily, I would have by now. I'm getting help, but it's not that simple. Just like you can't tell a depressed person to “snap out of it”, you can't tell someone with trichotillomania to “just stop”.,There are underlying issues at play – for me, I live with anxiety and depression, which means trichotillomania is a way of coping; just an extremely bad one, which is why I'm currently getting therapy to help with it. And this condition ruins lives. It makes people embarrassed, ashamed and scared to leave the house for fear of judgement. They spend hours trying to style their hair to cover bald patches so they don't get weird looks, and time that could be better spent pulling out their hair. It may not sound serious, but it is.,The condition is a form of OCD; a compulsion that you can't stop. It's also self-harm. It usually begins in the teenage years, and is apparently more common in women than men.,It's not a condition that's spoken about often, however a few people have – Sam Faiers from The Only Way is Essex recently spoke up, as did Olivia Munn from The Newsroom. An episode of Grey's Anatomy recently touched upon it, although not in the amount of detail I'd ideally have liked to raise awareness.,It would be better if more people could talk about it, but it's hard – I know, because even writing this post is difficult, let alone the fact I'm not going to publish it anonymously. I think it's incredibly brave for people to speak up about it, given it's something not many people know about let alone understand – the fear of being thought of as a “freak” and “weirdo” is high.,However if more people were open about it, it would be easier for others to speak up and get help, which is why I'm now doing it myself. I've decided it's time I went public about it – I wanted to write this post to let others out there like me know: you're not alone.,Please speak to someone about it, go to your doctors and get help. They'll be a lot more understanding than you anticipate. I am so grateful for the friends and family who have supported me and it's made me even more willing to stop. I haven't beaten my condition yet, but I'm working on it – and speaking up about it is the first hurdle."
,"Depression, my black dog, for me started early. I vividly remember breaking down, I must have been about 12, during a Saturday night family dinner due to the most intense feeling of futility and frustration with my life. God, the pain was excruciating at that age - still is but now I guess I'm used to it.,My parents, as lovely as they are, had no idea how to respond. My father’s approach, when not brutally teasing and making fun of me, was the usual: ‘There’s people worse off than you’, ‘get a hobby’, ‘what’s your problem?’ and so on. My mother would offer the great cure-all: tea and biscuits and my brother, well...who knows what he ever thought about anything!,Eventually, at the ripe old age of 18, I took an overdose and ended up in hospital. I spent one night and was then released. The devastation of being back ‘out there’ was too much to bare and so I took another overdose. This time I awoke on a table in front of an open cabinet of scalpels! Say no more! My father’s response? ‘What are you trying to do to us?’.,This time, I ended up in a psychiatric ward for about a week. So, surrounded by doctors and nurses you would think it was now ,. No, apparently it wasn’t. Again I was left to my own devices and after the week I was simply asked if I wanted to go home.,Looking back, there were so many opportunities for someone to sit down and just talk, converse, and communicate with me. It’s amazing to think that no one person (including family) asked why a young man would want to die. That stuck with me my whole life and my conclusion at the time seemed simple: no one cares, no one knows about me and no one wants to know about me.,The simplicity is mind blowing: you don't need to fix someone, you don't need to heal someone, you just need to sit with them and talk. The most powerful tool we have is empathy and when that is lacking then the results are devastating; especially when it involves family.,Later in life, this all spilled out in various ways; including frightening off friends when I could no longer hold my story in. By now I had also been involved in a cult and the effects of that were devastating. But again, when trying to integrate back into the world no one ounce of empathy was shown and no one wanted to talk.,I am still suffering but now, at least, I no longer care what people think; plus I can write better poetry from the experience! As I tell my story, there are those who fall away from me for whatever reason (usually fear) and there are those who stand by me (usually because they too have suffered in some way).,Even if it means drawing, painting or writing there are safe ways to express the pain if no one will talk with you, but at the end of the day communication and empathy are the greatest healers."
,"Iron Man 3 (2013) is based on the events of Tony Stark after The Avengers Assemble (2012). The synopsis describes how Tony Stark has developed Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) since he and the other Avengers fought against Loki and the army who were set to destroy Earth. He can’t sleep at night, has night terrors when he can sleep, and has , caused by trigger phrases.,In the past many films and television programs have portrayed mental and emotional illness in a way that makes them seem somewhat trivial and small or gives the impression that the character is a freak and not normal. It is refreshing to see that a blockbuster film, created by such a huge company as Marvel Entertainment, has taken a sensitive and still a somewhat taboo subject in our society and has made it understandable to the general public. It’s clear that the debilitating condition has greatly affected the hero. The script writers and Robert Downey Jr. have done a fantastic job in portraying mental illness in a way that people will understand and sympathise.,This is a positive step forward in our campaign against stigma. Films like Iron Man are watched by millions globally and are a great platform for this campaign. At the beginning of the year Channel 4 aired real life story , which showed the life of sixteen-year-old Rae who was recently discharged from a psychiatric hospital. This was a positive step forward as it depicted ,, in this case , and Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD), as it really is, how it affects the sufferer, their friends and family.,I believe that if more films and television programs continue to depicted mental illness in this way, as a real illness, then stigma could be greatly reduced in the near future."
,"I describe my , as a black monster of fog. It snuck up on me over a long period and it wasn’t until it was completely embedded in my core that I realised it was there.,I was living a “normal” life. I was a nurse, a carer, a daughter, a girlfriend, a sister and a friend. I had what most people would wish for. I went into work with the biggest smile on my face and was known for being the bubbly smiling nurse.,Inside though, I was slowly sinking further and further into a dark hole. I was unhappy most of the time, and my days off were spent on the couch with a duvet and the curtains closed. I cried myself to sleep. I had no idea why I felt this way, but I felt so ashamed and ungrateful to be feeling sad when others were so much worse off. I was a healthcare professional, I should have known better. . .,I told nobody. I kept up a facade and told nobody of the dark thoughts that were slowly filling my every waking and sleeping thought. Dreams haunted me, I barely slept and I lost 3 stone in weight. I felt so out of control of my mind that I controlled my eating to try to compensate. Little did I know how this began a cycle of physical illness, which in turn made me feel worse and worse mentally.,Things came to a head when I was lying in bed awake at 5am on Christmas Eve morning 2011. The pain I was feeling was unbearable and I felt so alone, in a house full of people. I took an overdose and luckily woke up 30 hours later in a hospital bed. My family were surrounding me, and I realised how much I was loved and cared for.,I spent 12 weeks of 2012 in a mental health hospital, getting the essential therapy I needed. I learnt how to cope with ,, how to eat healthy nutritious meals that help both my physical and ,, how to challenge the negative thoughts and how to include exercise and creativity in my recovery. Most importantly though, I learnt how to ask for help.,Over a year later and I am so grateful for the people who saved my life. As I opened up to my friends and family, I realised how much they cared and how much their support can help me to heal. I still have my bad days, but I know now not to be too hard on myself, to be proud of myself for every achievement of the day- some days this will be a lot, some days it might be just having a shower and going for a short walk.,I am healing, but it takes time and its not always straightforward. But I am so much happier than I have been for a long time. I have a brilliant counsellor, and an amazing support system. And now I can see the positive effects that this journey has had in my life. It has taught me about being mindfull, to take time to get to know myself, to listen more and to be sensitive to my own and others needs. I know I can do this now. And I am proud."
,"There are three things everyone should know about ,:,A friend once said to me – when I told her I was taking antidepressants – “oh Paul, but you’re not the type”.,So what ‘type’ is meant to have depression? Is it a lifestyle choice for a particular breed of moping misery guts?,No, of course it isn’t. The whole notion of ‘choosing’ to have depression is preposterous. But that idea is – incredibly – still widely held, and kept alive by phrases like ‘What have they got to be depressed about?’, ‘Everyone’s sad sometimes – get over it’, and ‘Man up’. People who say these things have no idea what they are talking about., – depression being one of the most common – in any one year. Unless you know a remarkably small number of people, this means that several people you know either have, or have had, a problem with their mental health. Think you can spot them?,Men are not always great at talking about how they feel. When I was first diagnosed with depression, I didn’t want to talk about it either. I kept it hidden and obviously managed to do so very effectively. A family who ran a local sandwich shop called me ‘Smiler’ because I was ‘always smiling’. They only saw me for five minutes a day, when I was buying something for lunch, at my best time of day. They weren’t to know I would be walking back to my desk wishing I didn’t exist.,I thought that if I told people about my illness they would draw certain conclusions about me – that I couldn’t do my job as well as I used to, for example. I didn’t want them to know I had to take tablets because I was too stressed to cope with everything life was throwing at me. They might think I was weak.,Actually, I’d been coping incredibly well for months and years, balancing a busy job with a hectic and demanding family life, as a father of two young children getting a pitiful amount of sleep. It gradually caught up with me.,Dr Tim Cantopher, in his brilliant book Depressive Illness: The Curse of the Strong, describes stress-related depression as a blown fuse. You overload your body and brain until something inside goes bang. Unfortunately, it takes a lot of time and treatment to repair that damage.,The ignorance and stigma surrounding mental illness persist. Some comments, like my friend’s, are not meant maliciously. It’s just a case of people not understanding depression because they haven’t been through it themselves. Others delight in their ignorance and enjoy belittling those who are courageous enough to talk openly about their experiences.,This playground bully mentality festers among the male population – that desire to show how tough you are, how strong you are, how brave you are. You want to see those qualities? Look at someone who’s gone through depression – that’s what they need to get through each day.,You could be young or old, black or white, gay or straight, big or small; a boxer, footballer, actor, rock star, plumber, joiner, journalist, manager, truck driver, artist, fisherman, builder, pub landlord – whatever. Depression isn’t picky.,Let’s not be ‘strong, silent types’. Let’s show our strength and courage by standing up to this crippling illness and fighting the stigma."
,"When I , I was feeling very low and very isolated. Due to the mental health discrimination I experienced at the hands of my previous employers I had been made redundant from a job working with big cats, amongst whom there were three lions I adored. ,Being around these lions gave me so much positive emotional support despite the fact they didn’t know a word of English between them and were terrible at holding a conversation! Joking aside, it may sound very saccharine, but working with these animals was the best therapy I’ve ever had.,When ,and ,get a grip of your mind they lock you into a world where there seems to be no hope, a world where you feel no one cares and that every effort you make is doomed to failure. Of course, friends and family do care, they care very much, but it must be difficult for them to understand an illness that most of the time we struggle to understand ourselves and find even harder to articulate into words.,And that’s the catch 22 of the situation. If we don’t talk about it how will those people we care most about ever understand how it feels for us on a daily basis? How can we say that no one really gets us if we don’t at least try to tell them how we’re feeling? Of course, when we do try and talk and are on the end of a negative response it can be devastating and almost certainly means we’ll not want to try again anytime soon.,I feel I’ve lost a lot of friends because of my depression, but after much angst and torment about how it must be my fault, I’ve decided to give myself a break. I can only go half way in helping to make myself understood. I can only say so many times how I’m feeling. It needs the people I’m talking to, to want to listen and to want to help. Conversely, there’s only so many times a friend or loved one can ask what’s wrong whilst we continue to wear our masks and say everything’s ok. If we don’t say what’s on our mind when we’re genuinely asked, can we really bemoan our shrinking social circle?,I finally settled on the idea there was no right or wrong in these situations and it’s was best not to dwell on lost friends, I couldn’t afford the nervous energy. Of course I will miss my friends and I will always miss my lions, but I had to find a way forward. I couldn’t continue to take part in that never ending merry go round of negative thoughts that so epitomises depression and anxiety. ,My GP, who is fantastic, had told me during my darkest moments that one day I would reach ‘the bottom of the barrel’; that place where I felt myself standing on top of a cliff edge in the midst of a storm with the black sea crashing against the rocks below. He told me that eventually a moment would come where my energy and hope would slowly return. Coming to terms with the loss of friends and animals alike, appears to have been that moment. ,I decided I wanted to ,, but wanted a safe environment to do so before risking rejection from less than empathetic ears. I thought a local mental health support group would be a good place to start but alas couldn’t find one in my area. ,So I’ve been in contact with the , and we are in early discussions about starting a new group in my area with me as the facilitator! Frankly the idea terrifies me, but I feel the exposure to a little terror will only be good in the long term. If the support group is a success then folk with depression and associated mental health issues in my area will have somewhere to go, have a chat and enjoy a cuppa and a bit of cake. ,They won’t need to feel isolated waiting for the text or message from a friend that never comes asking them how they are feeling or if they fancy a coffee. Ok, so keeping the talking ‘in house’ at first may seem a little insular, but hopefully the group will give everyone who attends some additional confidence to maybe talk outside of the group when the time feels right for them.,I feel I may have already made a little difference in being more open. I recently went to my eldest daughter’s school review. She was 15 at the time and her teachers were telling me about the social issues they would be covering in the coming term. The usual suspects of drugs, alcohol, gambling and sex were mentioned. I really want my two daughters above everyone else to understand mental health, so I suggested to the teacher that she should give some time over to the subject. ,My eldest daughter has some complicated learning difficulties and as such her emotions can tend to swing from one end of the scale to the other, so I feel it’s essential she is aware of mental health issues as I feel she may be more vulnerable to them. I quoted the 1 in 4 stat to her teacher and she seemed genuinely amazed. To her credit she took on board what I said and a few weeks later my daughter spoke to me for the first time about depression after they had discussed it in class following the sad loss of a fellow pupil.,In addition, I’ve also started writing my memoirs which may sound very self important, but I find writing my inner most feelings down to be great self therapy. What I hope is that my emotional energy continues to rise and that I will come to a place where I’m ‘better’ and that I can present a fully rounded picture of depression through my book. At the moment it’s not a very positive read so I’ll give it a few more years before I unleash it on the literary world!,I’m not entirely sure what the point of this blog is, other than I feel I am on a slightly upward spiral and I feel I’ve come to that place partly through talking or wanting to talk I feel it is essential to ending the outdated, stereotypical and appalling stigma and discrimination that surrounds mental health.,Oh and I’ve learnt to spell discrimination properly because I’ve typed it out so blooming often!!!"
,"I have , since a very young age. Despite this, not many people know about my battle. It just isn’t something that people talk about.,The incidence of depression is on the increase yet it isn’t a subject that many feel they can speak about freely. Perhaps it is because we live in a society where we have to wear a facade and act like everything is fine. Whatever the reason, the , leaves many people feeling isolated and alone.,My depression worsened after giving birth to my son and I was put onto anti depressants. Very few people, to this day, know about the added help I received from medication. It has helped me to function and carry on with life although it doesn’t work for everyone. ,I saw a psychiatrist soon after my son was born and he explained that depression is an illness and can be likened to breaking your leg. If you broke your leg you would want a crutch to get around on until your leg had healed. He told me that antidepressants work in the same way. They help you get back on your feet, so to speak (excuse the pun!).,I work as a psychologist/counsellor. I regularly tell my clients when I first meet them that it is my policy not to acknowledge them if we happen to bump into each other in public. This is due to confidentiality and, sadly, the stigma associated with mental health issues. Many clients do not want family and/or friends asking awkward questions about who I am. I am always happy for them to approach me if they wish. In this way, they get to choose whether they feel ready to divulge the truth about the nature of our ‘relationship’.,I do find it odd how we accept physical illness as long as it doesn’t involve the brain. Almost as if a mysterious brain ailment might be catching.,My grandmother lived with depression and so did my mother. They also drank alcohol, which didn’t mix well with the anti-depressants they were taking. It seems as if the increasing pressures life places on us all predisposes some of us to feeling low and/or anxious.,Couple that with the general lack of support and it can be a recipe for disaster. Since I have been more open about my depression, I have had many friends and acquaintances revealing their own struggle with low mood and ,. Many of us have experienced similar symptoms – not wanting to get out of bed in the morning, losing interest in activities we usually enjoy and feeling numb and detached from life. I also found out how common it was for many to experience problems for at least a year before deciding to do anything about it.,I have felt a huge relief since sharing my experience with others. It made me feel less alone and opened up a whole world of support that I never knew existed. I realised how many others were going through exactly the same experience and realised how we all shut ourselves off from the world and didn’t reach out to anyone. We all felt we would be a burden to each other.,Life is so much better now that I have a wonderful support network. I feel proud for accepting who I am and for honouring that part of me that sometimes needs a little extra understanding.,Mandy blogs at ,Mandy is on "
,"When one shouts the phrase “mental health” a sudden cold breeze enters the atmosphere. But why does this cold breeze seem to consume the majority of us? After all ,.,This year the , following the lives of young people in the McGuiness unit Manchester, who struggle with their mental health. I have been following the series not only to focus on whether it fairly represents the young but also to follow the story of Beth, whose experience is similar to mine.,For as long as I can recall I have struggled with eating. At the age of 4 I was taken to local dietician with my mum to try and solve my issue with food. Little did I know that this struggle would remain with me even now at the age of 16. My Anorexia Nervosa has led me to become obsessed with not eating; self-harming if I do, leaving me depressed with life with the occasional suicidal thought that lingers in my mind, similar to Beth.,Beth is only a year older than I am, and this year stayed on the McGuiness unit for up to 6months. She took the courageous decision to go to the hospital to get her life back on track. This is something that truly inspires me. She is portrayed as an extrovert like me who contradicts the stereotype of a sufferer of ,.,In the final episode we see the turmoil of emotions that she experiences as she gets angered by the change in medication, self-harms, then starts to improve her eating, finds a little love and happily finds the path to recovery. I can empathise with Beth as it is truly a struggle for people with anorexia to repair their relationship with food, as sufferers feel as though they’re failing by eating.,I think that the BCC have fairly represented her story, enabling viewers to see her struggles through her eyes as well as the doctors. Nonetheless, her experience doesn’t fairly represent the experience of all people living with anorexia. For example, my eating problem is fuelled by my obsessive need to gain control over aspects of my life, which I don’t feel is explored in the programme,Beth is treated fairly on the ward like all patients; the doctors do what is best for her by placing her under the Mental Health Act and ‘Rainbow’ programme to help with her eating. However, the Mental Health Act is portrayed as something sinister in the programme from my point of view. I believe it is a tool that can be used to help guide the young onto the path of recovery and should be portrayed in a more positive light. The act is not fairly portrayed in this programme in my opinion.,Sadly, there is still a lot of stigma around mental health and some was not expressed in this programme. The show didn’t focus on the stigma surrounding self-harm which recently has blown up in the media. I faced stigma because of it as people on the outside saw it as “ridiculous” and “pointless”, but many young people use it as a coping method, that helps to release pain, which people need to understand. However, the programme does highlight that anyone can have a mental problem.,I know we are human and it is in our nature to judge those that are around us whether we like it or not. But remember we all have a mental health; it is just 1 in 4 people whose mental health is poorly. So we should respect and support each other as this stigma against mental health is not necessary. As the programme highlights, there is a light at the end of a dark tunnel for sufferers, and as a community we must help make that light shine brighter for those that are poorly."

I had never told anyone before, but I had suicide ideation early in my diagnosis.,There are over 500 books in my house. At least 40 of them are journals of mine, oversized beasts with papers stuck in them, and little pocket sized notepads with scribbles, and fancy pants ones from the British Library, or moleskin covered. But there is one hidden away, that I’ve carried from home to home, and over the Atlantic, that is empty. That one was to be the final journal.,When I was initially diagnosed with bipolar, I saw it as a death sentence. It would be the thing that killed me. There was no point in attempting to have a ‘normal’ life, or to live for that matter. So, I bought a beautiful journal. And I would fill it with my writings, and drawings, and stuff. And when I was done, and that journal was filled to the brim with me, I would kill myself. Not the most reasonable course of self-treatment, but as Stephen Fry said, you can’t reason your way out of ,, as it isn’t reasonable. I took solace in knowing that once the journal was finished, at least I’d have something worthwhile to show for my life. I’d have created something of worth.,I never started that journal. The depression passed, and by the time the next cycle came, I had learned better coping skills. I eventually found love, and we began a family.

When one of us has a relapse or a particularly bad day, the other is always there. And on the days where neither of us is well enough to go to class, the others company really does make it easier to get through.,On these bad days we go to the room our school has to cater for people with issues they may have. We have mentors there who are trained to help us through our problems. They give us advice and encouragement and make sure that our education doesn’t completely go down the drain.,Sometimes when we are losing hope about our futures we make plans for what we will do, like starting up our own online business, even if we can't manage university or even leaving the house. We both go to the same mental health service, and quite often our appointments are at the same time so we wait together and chat. It’s funny how the techniques we learn in cognitive behavioural therapy sessions can be turned into something fun. We practise the techniques such as mindfulness, relaxation, and colour therapy together, though sometimes we find it hard to keep a straight face.,Like most people with mental health problems, we have both had to deal with more than our fair share of ,. You would think at a , where they have a room for people with these issues to study in if they aren't well enough to go to class, the other teachers would be sufficiently trained to assist with these problems too. However in our school, this is not always the case.,We both have cards explaining that we have full permission to leave classes and sit outside when necessary. Sometimes the teachers don’t seem to understand the complexity of our problems.,Why should we be punished for having an illness? All of our teachers have been sent emails explaining the safety behaviours that should be allowed. We can wear headphones in class to avoid silence which is a trigger for both of us and Laura must always be allowed a water bottle as she panics without one. But still, every now and again a teacher decides this shouldn’t be permitted.,Fran was once shouted at and told that it shouldn’t be allowed because in the real world special treatment wouldn’t be given. Thankfully we have our mentors who do care a lot and one or two of our other teachers do too.,Some of the other students aren’t very kind either; they either make jokes or tell us we’re making it up. A group of lads once started a rumour saying Laura was possessed by the devil because of a panic attack she had. When people hear ‘mental illness’, they think it’s just in our heads.,They don’t realise how much physical pain they actually cause; how you have a constant headache, how you’re dizzy most of the time or how your sleep pattern is non-existent due to horrible nightmares. They tell you that you’re just making a fuss and that you should get over yourself. But we always stick up for each other and have learnt to not take these things to heart. Thanks to each other, our horrible experiences haven’t always been so bad and it’s always nice to know that we will always have each other.,A few months ago, we contacted our head of year asking if he could do an assembly on mental health awareness, but there just wasn’t enough time.

,"OCD... Oh yeah... OCD is about neatness and tidiness, isn't it? It's about keeping things in order... It's washing your hands a lot...,This was my, and I’m sure many other people's, view of OCD. In fact, I make fun of myself a lot because I am incredibly untidy. I wish I had the tidiness part of OCD I claim... But I know that really I wish I didn't experience this condition at all.,People laugh about the compulsions that can come with OCD. I know, I have done it myself. With a laugh they say ""Oh I've got that! I check the door all the time,"" or ""I know what you mean, I'm a neat freak."" This makes any explanation harder in some ways because they may just do these things with no compulsion involved.,I have not told many people about the OCD thing, lots of people know that I have , and , but when people think that OCD is all about tidiness because that’s what TV shows them, then how can I explain my OCD. I worry that people will not believe me because if I was washing my hands or keeping my stuff majorly tidy, then you would be able to see it. My OCD is hidden in my head and leaves me with this crippling anxiety so that I can't function properly.,The people that I have told are the people that I knew would make the big effort to understand anyway. The people that have been there for me when I have been off work with anxiety and the people who ask how I am and care about the answer. The fact that it requires a huge explanation puts me off. I have to explain the condition first, that it is about obsessing and compulsions, not that it is about tidiness, then move on to how it is for me.,These people have been ace but I wish I could be more open about it. It's the fear of people thinking I should just be able to ignore it all and the lack of understanding of what OCD can be that puts me off.

I always thought I was simply rubbish at enjoying things, at living in the moment, at being sociable with others. But what I didn't know, was that the constant buzz in my head is not normal or at least it's not what everyone else experiences.

I compulsively pick away at myself, I question everything and if I can see the negative in something then I do.,This is not low self-esteem, this is obsessive worrying and compulsive thinking causing pain...

,"Throughout  school I was an A* student with aspirations of attending Cambridge University but 4 years on from my GCSE's I am working for my Mum and living with depression. ,It wasn’t until about 6 months ago that things took a turn for the worse. I failed my first year of university and family deaths collided in the same week, which sent me further into this black hole than I had ever been before and it was at this point I was diagnosed.,Since I was 16 I’ve never felt entirely at ease with myself, whether it was down to stress or hormones or anything else is beside the point, the matter was not addressed then and had therefore spiralled. I did not recognise this feeling as anything more than being grumpy or being “welcomed to the real world”, only now do I realise that I have been , for years unnecessarily.,Before 6 months ago I saw depression just as self-loathing or almost as an attention seeking condition, not as an illness. As much as I, or anyone else, can try and explain the way it really is to my family, friends and most of all my boyfriend, they will never understand fully how the inside of my head feels and how I am the one who hates it most of all.,The first person I talk to about my diagnosis was my mum. I was nervous about how she’d react and even more nervous about how I was going to tell her. We don’t have the closest of relationships. It’s not bad but being one of 4 sisters I am possibly the least close to her out of my siblings. The only way I felt comfortable enough to tell her was by text. I felt weak and pathetic doing so but it stimulated a reasonably open conversation face to face.,She was sympathetic and most of all caring.  She asked no questions and just simply accepted it. This was exactly what I needed but not what I expected. I thought my Mum would try and understand or find out why I was the way I was but she didn’t and it was perfect. From time to time we will have these open conversations just so she is aware of what state I am in, other than that is not something we talk about. It’s too uncomfortable but just knowing she is accepting and sympathetic of the condition is plenty.,Each day is almost as though I am a fly on the wall watching myself and thinking how ridiculous I am being; getting hysterical over the tiniest dispute with my boyfriend, flipping out when my sister uses my conditioner. I never noticed something was wrong but I was lucky enough to have someone close enough to me that did and saw it get progressively worse. It is because of that reason I feel like I am able to tell them my darkest thoughts sometimes.,I thought I was just nervous when I left for University a year and a half ago and that I would settle in soon enough. No one there was horrible to me, I made friends and got along fine. However, this was all disrupted by travelling to see my boyfriend every weekend because it was with him that I felt most comfortable and by doing this I stopped myself from ever feeling at home. ,When it came to exams I used to sit there and stare at my work, read things but not even recognise them as words any more. My mind was somewhere else entirely and maybe still is. When at the end of the summer I was told I couldn’t return, I felt horribly relieved but also in pieces. I had always been the academic one, now what was I?,Living back at home has its ups and downs, I feel more comfortable here, but having spent a year living on my own being back in the same house as my parents can really take its toll. I have tried to explain that I’m not ready for my failings to become joked about yet and that I am overly sensitive at the moment.,Writing this has taken me hours, every sentence I read back makes me feel guilty. But why should it? Why should I feel guilty or ashamed of the way I feel? I shouldn’t, and if I recognised and attended to these problems months, even years ago then I don’t think I would. So please pay attention to all those around you and any subtle change in behaviour or attitude, it could be something that will get much worse without anyone else realising, even themselves."
,"It's been four months since I 'chose' to leave my job because it was felt I wasn’t well enough for my role. It’s the second job I’ve now 'left' in such circumstances and its normal, if not necessarily helpful, to wonder who or what is to blame for this career relapse.,When I started my last job, I was upfront with my closest colleagues and the bosses about my mental health condition. As someone who ,, I’ve learnt that it’s pretty hard and detrimental to pretend otherwise.,My then new boss had picked me off the floor from a previous breakdown. I felt confident, supported and empowered once more. I was the happiest I had ever been in my fifteen plus year career and this showed in the results coming from the team I worked with.,Perhaps inevitably though, after three or so years the environment changed. A new boss came in and with a biting recession and us being one of only a few successful teams in the company; it all led to excessive pressure being applied. When management needed someone to blame, they picked on the weakest person known to be actually a bit ""mad"", because they all knew I was on medication.,Although I tried to explain on repeated occasions what I was experiencing I could feel myself slipping into a hole. The stupid taboos and , mean people are largely ignorant of your actual situation. It was like living in a nightmare where although I was screaming ""HELP ME"" at the top of my voice, nobody could hear me. ,In desperation, it seemed the only way I could make it clear to anyone what was happening to me was 'flipping out' on a couple of occasions. Inevitably HR were brought in and this led down the usual path of compromise agreement and I left fairly soon after.,To be fair on a basic corporate level the company played everything by the book, paying for me to see a psychotherapist after the initial outburst and then later settling fairly when it came to the money offered in the compromise agreement. But that's not the point! Better, more effective and louder dialogues around mental health issues need to be heard across society. We're not freaks who need to be ""managed out"" of our careers. The fact that I led this successful team for four years should not be forgotten.,So who's to blame? Well we all are, I believe, and that includes the many of us living and working with mental health conditions. There's no reason why the majority of us shouldn't be capable of performing successfully in our jobs with the right support and understanding of our issues.,I was naive to think that an upfront disclosure of my condition would mean people would understand how to best manage me. There just isn't yet enough information out there and what people do know about mental illness is still tainted by stigma. I'm not proud to have taken a large lump sum off my company but how else am I meant to provide for my family when pushed into the tight corner of misunderstanding around my condition. It's still potentially very damaging for a departing employee's confidence and future prospects to be told they are ""not well enough to do the job"" yet that's what happened to me; and by then we'd all failed.,I can't help but feel that, if there had been better understanding, such an abrupt and expensive action would never have occurred. If , about promoting ,, we could all sleep a little a better at night, knowing tomorrow could be an altogether more enjoyable, productive and cost efficient day of work."
,"As someone who has lived with , and depression on and off for many years, there is one thing that has always remained.  It doesn’t cost a penny, it can’t be bought or sold, but it is one of the most valuable things to me.  ,A listening ear.  It is that listening ear that has got me through some of the toughest times in my life.  But this is a particular kind of listening ear.  One that comes without judgement.  ,You see, one of the hardest things for us folk who struggle with anxiety and , is the fear of judgement.  We are pretty hard on ourselves at the best of times.  So, to open ourselves up to others, let them in and tell them our struggles, can be one of the scariest things in the world. ,If you are like me, you like to keep these ‘dark secrets’ and weird and wonderful ways, carefully hidden.  You work hard at the pretense that everything is fine and lock away as much as possible from those around you.  But sometimes, like a kettle that is about to boil, the pressure is just too much.  And it is at those boiling points that you kind of just, well, burst.  The trick is making sure you share how you feel with someone so you don’t actually get to that bursting point!,However, in my experience, there are certain people that you tell who seem to make things so much worse.  Opening yourself up to someone is hard.  I don’t tend to start my conversations with ‘Hi, I’m Ciara, I get stupidly anxious over nothing at all and sometimes just want to hide away’.  As you can imagine, I’m sure my conversations would probably end there.  ,Speaking to someone and having them judge and criticise you is like someone telling you you are useless, that you are not a particularly good person and that there is something seriously wrong.  Do you not think that we ponder these things ourselves?  That we berate ourselves most days for struggling to function in what society deems as a ‘normal’ way?  ,Enter my non-judgemental ear.  Someone who has been there for the past 10 years of this weird-and-wonderful-brain-of-mine.  Someone who at times struggled desperately to understand, but who listened all the same.  That someone I am proud to call my best friend.  Over the years she has pushed me onto trains when I have wanted to run screaming, taken me to gigs when I have wanted to hide in the corner, and sat and cried with me when I simply couldn’t leave my house.,She is someone who is always at the end of the phone.  Who, even if she has nothing to say, will simply listen.  Sometimes I don’t want her to say anything, and she knows those moments too.  And sometimes she will simply say, ‘I’m sorry, dude.  I wish there was something I could do to make it better.’  As a strong Christian, I know she has always prayed for me, encouraged me and done all she could to be there for me, even in those moments where the answers seem so clear to her.  But to me they seem like climbing Everest. ,I don’t know what the next ten years will look like, but I know one thing, my non-judgemental ear will be there, providing me with the support that I will never take for granted., just remember this.  You don’t need to have wise words, you don’t need to have all the answers and you don’t even need to have experienced it yourself.  All you need to do is be there.  Without judgement.  Sometimes with a cup of tea, and more importantly with a hug. ,Never underestimate the power of a non-judgemental ear and a hug.  I reckon with these  two things in your grasp you could really help change the world!  "
,"My mental health issues first started due to bullying in the workplace. My manager would pick up on the tiniest of errors and blow them out of proportion, stand over your shoulder as you wrote emails, correcting mistakes you hadn’t made yet and berate anyone that wasn’t in the office to their colleagues. It doesn’t sound like much but, after putting up with it for 8 months, I just couldn’t take it anymore. I had been crying on and off after work for about 6 months.,I never realised I was depressed; I always thought that kind of thing happened to other people. My GP signed me off from work for the last two weeks of my notice and I was prescribed anti-depressants to help me manage my anxiety and depression. My manager refused to believe that I was , despite my doctor’s certificates; that was 9 months ago and I’m still waiting on my last month’s pay as she still doesn’t accept that I have mental health issues.,I was very nervous about going back to work as that’s where my issues had started but I pushed myself and signed up with a temp agency. I explained my , and they were really understanding, they even found me a job to start the next day. I had an anxiety attack before I walked in but I made myself do it anyway, and it was fine; the people were nice and very professional. That wasn’t so bad and they clearly couldn’t tell I had any mental health issues.,The things I thought were a dead giveaway (fidgeting, flushing, sweaty palms) weren’t even noticed. After a few more short placements I had regained some of my confidence and was placed in a long-term assignment. At around the same time I received a call from the complex care team to tell me that I had reached the top of the list to receive Cognitive Behavioural Therapy. Now I was in a dilemma: I needed the on-going work but I would have to see the clinical psychologist every week so I needed to say something.,At first I told my temp boss it was for “treatment” but I was so ashamed that I couldn’t own up to my problems, it just added to my negative feelings. I already felt embarrassed because there are no obvious outward signs. In some of my darker times I don’t believe myself and I wonder if I’m making the whole thing up to get attention. After a couple more weeks in the job I decided to just go for it and made a throw away comment as a start. The next time it came up I explained a little more and then a little more.,As it turned out my boss was amazingly sympathetic, he was flexible about the hours I did so that I could still earn the same amount of money while shifting my hours around to accommodate my CBT. I was so relieved to find that there are good managers out there and not everyone was like my old boss. My new manager was compassionate, accommodating and really supportive. It’s a terrible cliché but it restored my faith in humanity… or at least in managers. From then on the rest of the placement was really good and I became much more relaxed, unfortunately as it was a temp contract I would soon have to move on.,Regrettably, not everyone is so understanding, the next workplace I went to I had a very different experience…"
,"So, I am sitting here, writing a blog for Time to Change on the impact and effect that writing a , has had on me.,This week, I am in retreat mode. I want nothing more than to run away from everyone, not because people have hurt me or upset me. Not because I wish I had never written the blog but more because I am simply overwhelmed and exhausted. How do you process ,, in less than a month, all because you spoke about how you are often miserable?,Within a couple of hours of posting the blog, a journalist had been in touch to let me know they would be running a story on it the next day. By the time I went to bed that night, I was getting tweets, emails and messages from all over the place.,I had emails coming in from all over the place asking for interviews and I began to get a little nervous that this can, I had opened, was something that would perhaps be a little more than I could handle.,Interview requests aside, the thing that really struck me was the number of people commenting on my blog, tweeting me, emailing me, and later writing to me. I have had depression for a long time and have often thought about the fact that , or mentioned, particularly in ,.,More often, when I have told people that I have depression, there has been an awkward silence. However, some people say 'me too but I don't know who to talk to'. Depression is a common thing, yet, here I was, surprised that so many others were relieved to hear someone, speak of it themselves.,I realised that I didn't want to be someone who mentioned it briefly and ran, so I decided, with the help of Time to Change, to speak a little more. I knew of Cole Moreton and he had asked for an interview for the Sunday Telegraph, so I decided, that this would be, a good way to go.,That interview was relatively easy and he was so kind, generous and funny that I relaxed. I am not really afraid of talking about my depression, on a one on one basis. I never have been. However, when I first saw the article in the paper, I suddenly realised that it was a little bigger than I had imagined. I was terrified. Everyone was going to know how 'messed up' I really was. All my fears came out and I just waited, wanting to see the response. Cole wrote a very kind article about me. He was considerate and sensitive, but it felt like I had bared my soul for anyone to see.,The reaction was huge. It was generous, loving and kind. Once again, hundreds of people in a similar situation got in touch. I felt overwhelmed, I was touched by the fact that simply talking about my depression had had such an impact.,I then had another interview coming up, that was for ,. I did that last Thursday evening as a pre-record and I can say that it was harder than anything else I had yet done. I find myself now, the night before it is broadcast, emotionally drained, thinking about what I have done.,Life has changed and I can't help wondering whether perhaps the 'title' I gave myself as ABCD (Archbishop of Canterbury's Daughter) will now become ABCDD (depressed daughter), in response. Will this illness be what I am known for? Will it be my defining feature in the eyes of those who encounter me?,I guess it is one of the great fears and reasons that so few speak out. Who wants to be defined by their illness? However, I see no reason why I should be. I am glad I have made a noise. I hope that by doing so others will feel that they can tell their family, friends, or go to the doctor, without fear of judgement.,I am many things and one of those is depressed. Yes, it affects my day to day life. Yes, it might last a long time. But, no, it is not my defining feature. Those who have only seen that side of me, might only be able to define me by my depression but those that know me, will not find it possible to see it as all that I am.,I am happy I wrote the blog and I am grateful for the enormous support and encouragement I have received since. Thank you, and I would encourage you to speak too. I have received a huge amount of love, from the most unexpected places. If I could take one thing away from all of this, it is that we are not as alone as we might have thought."
,"I was 20. I came from a loving family, gained the highest results throughout my education and was in the final year of my Speech and Language Therapy degree.,I knew about mental health issues; close relatives experienced anxiety and depression.,But I couldn't be affected by mental health problems...could I?,It started with low mood and I just didn't feel like my confident, bubbly self. Soon the days of self loathing turned to weeks and then months. I was approaching my final year exams and success had always been a strong motivator for me but I found myself thinking 'what is the point?' 'what value do I have to offer the world?' I became apathetic and lost all interest in myself and those around me.,After another day of feeling worthless I decided to have a hot bath. Suddenly the thought of self-harming popped into my head. I was on the brink of despair, feeling as though no one would miss me if I was gone. However, I knew this was untrue and my inner self shouted at me for having such thoughts. I realised it was time to talk. My mother is an extremely strong woman and I knew she would support me and tell me what to do. The first question she asked is ""why do you feel like that?"",Why is a very good question, but a question that I struggled to answer. 'What was wrong with me? Why was I suddenly feeling like this?',I spent hours trying to attribute my feelings to something or someone but could not figure it out. Only when I dated the change in myself did I realise it started around the time I had the contraceptive implant. I scrolled female health blogs for hours trying to learn how or why this had happened. What I read suggested that there is a link between depression and being on the contraceptive implant due to a hormone imbalance.,I went straight to the family planning clinic and waited patiently to be seen.,The female nurse escorted me to a consultation room to discuss why I was there.,I explained that since having the implant I was feeling low, apathetic and felt I had put on weight. She interrupted me and stated that this was not to do with the implant. This was a very unlikely symptom and my sudden change in mental health must have been attributed to my recent life changing trip to South Africa.,Did I hear her correctly?,""I know my own body, and there is something wrong."" She laughedand said ""almost every woman tells me they know their own body better, the truth is you don't."" The words still ring in my ears. I was frustrated and upset but I held every single tear so that I would not give her any sense of satisfaction. 'Get me out of here' The thought repeated itself over and over. She finally agreed to take the implant out...next month...by the doctor who ""strongly dislikes removing implants because you are not being very cost effective."" I booked my appointment and left, crying all the way to my car.,It suddenly hit me... the fear people have when talking about mental health. The stigma associated with it. I tried to talk about what I was going through and this nurse had humiliated me and made me feel even more stupid and worthless than when I walked into the clinic. I called my mum, who immediately rang the clinic to complain and told them I was high risk of self harm or suicide if they left me for another month. I was asking for help to be told I was not being cost effective.,The experience changed me. I know first-hand how difficult it is to think dark and self loathing thoughts about yourself. I did not want to talk about it aloud because I did not want another person to view me like I viewed myself.,I have now completed my degree and I am in a loving relationship and have a fantastic job (which involves working with people who have mental health problems).,I see now how incredibly strong people with mental health problems are!,It is time to talk to show each and every person that they are incredibly strong. It is time to change the way society views people with mental health problems so that they can talk openly without fear or stigma. It is time to educate people and increase awareness."
,"I have been diagnosed with anxiety and depression but have told very few people about my diagnosis. I’m not sure why this is to be honest but I feel so low that I have decided to concentrate on getting better first before talking to people about my illness.,I start to feel better but am aware of the need to , especially at work but I still hold back from having the conversation. I think this is because I am worried about what people will think about me and about how my manager will perceive me and whether this will have a negative impact on both my career prospects and my pay at work.,I have been successfully referred to a counsellor for CBT but now I need to talk to my manager about my illness, as I will need to take time off work to go for my sessions with my counsellor.,Needless to say, during the time between deciding to have the conversation and actually having it, I become anxious about the conversation and how it would go. However, I have no choice but to have the conversation so as to be able to attend my CBT sessions. I’ll have to tell my manager.,The good thing is, though, that the CBT sessions give me an excuse to raise the subject with my manager but, as you can imagine, I am still feeling pretty nervous when I sit down to talk to him.,I plan the conversation as best I can in my head beforehand but there is such a sense of apprehension that I’m sure when I blurted out the words “I’m suffering from depression and anxiety”, my manager probably had to take a double take to make sure he had heard me right.,Once I utter those words however, I feel like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders. I have now done all I can in this situation by telling my boss what is wrong with me. The ball is now in his court in terms of how he responds and how the conversation goes from here.,The first thing my manager says is that he is surprised as there was nothing obviously wrong with me (I’m sure we’ve all been in the situation where we pretend that everything is okay even when it isn’t). I then take the opportunity to explain a bit more about how I feel and how it affects me at work. In essence, I want to get as much information out there about me in this first meeting so that I can then begin to move on psychologically afterwards. I don’t tell him everything and stick to telling him what I am comfortable with him knowing but the fact that I am having the conversation at all cheers me enormously.,Once I explain to my boss what is going on with me in terms of how I feel and the treatment I am having (I was taking sleeping pills at the time along with anti-depressants), he is extremely supportive. He says I can take time off work for my therapy - he even offers to take me to my first session so that I won’t have to worry about public transport – and says I can take time off if my anxiety became too much. Essentially, he couldn’t have done any more to help me and make me feel comfortable about what I have told him. This means a lot to me, as my anxieties around work were a key driver behind why I became depressed and anxious in the first place. Therefore, by telling ‘work’ what is wrong, I am able to become less anxious overall.,After our initial conversation, my manager continues to support me and regularly takes time out to ask me how I am. I have now finished my CBT but after each session, I give him a brief update as to how it has gone so that he is fully aware of how I am progressing. This makes it easier for him to manage the business if I have to take time off. This is the sort of thing that my manager appreciates and, in a situation such as this, I feel that it is important to consider the needs of those around you as this will make others more inclined to give you support if and when you need it.,And that is the story of “my conversation”.,And, I can honestly say that having that conversation was one of the key milestones in my ongoing recovery from mental illness."
,"For most of my life I’ve been dealt with a cycle of ,, , and , that has been (at times) crippling, and (for the most part) misunderstood by those around me.,When I was first admitted to hospital, I knew that I had psychosis but I didn’t really know what it was. I didn’t know what it meant, what caused it, or what kind of stigma was attached to it. The doctors were unhelpful, telling me psychosis was a grey area and therefore hard to define. ,Possibly this was the reasoning behind the label they slapped me with. I was diagnosed with Paranoid Schizophrenia, which I know now to be an incorrect diagnosis, and sent on my way. It wasn’t until talking with my newly appointed Community Psychiatric Nurse (CPN) from my local Early Intervention Team that I began to form an idea of what it was that affected me.,Before this point, talking to anyone about my ailment was counter-productive. I’d say the word ‘psychosis’, which most were unfamiliar with (including myself), and then try to clarify with the word ‘,’. Not a particularly good idea, in hindsight.,It turns out that using that word, thanks to the media, tends make people think you’re a serial killer. That or, more bizarrely, that you share your body with an alter ego. (If I had one, I’d call it Janet.) Couple that assumption with some scars on my face, and I had the perfect recipe for scaring people away. Even potential volunteer work was jeopardised thanks to the stigma attached to the illness.,It might seem hard to believe, and possibly quite selfish, but for a long time I was envious of people with depression. I was envious of those with anorexia. Not because I, for a second, feel either of those illnesses are easier to deal with, but because I feel that they’re more in the spotlight. People know, to some basic, uninvolved degree, what the hell those words mean.,Obviously, there’s still stigma attached, there’s still a risk of being ridiculed and undermined, but it seems there may be more understanding of how it can affect people. It was this frustration that lead me to learn more about psychosis and, through talking to my CPN, to my psychiatrist, and to others with the illness, I was able to not only inform myself but those around me. I was then able to keep on talking, not only to professionals but to people in my personal life. ,The mutual understanding that I now had with my loved ones pulled me out of my slump, I was able to communicate better, to motivate and (dare I say it?) love myself. I don’t feel ashamed to be open about my problems anymore, because I can explain them.,However I knew and I still know that not everyone would be able to communicate so easily with those around them. In fact, disorganisation in the way you communicate is a symptom of psychosis, and perhaps one of many reasons the illness has been swept under the radar. I wanted to help, and so I looked to (what I still see as) the main, perpetuating, stigma solidifying force in the universe: the media.  ,I have never seen any kind of video on broadcast, and rarely even on the internet, that raises awareness about psychosis. Never. I’m sure if I search hard enough, I would find some scrap of something but that’s hardly the point. There is nothing circulating, obvious and available. More worryingly, the only things I do find on anything related to ,, have something extremely unhelpful attached to them; a negative tone.,Everything I see or hear regarding mental illness displays it as this vast, towering thing that swallows people up; chewing at people and never leaving. How is this helpful? This not only makes people more afraid of the mentally ill but gives those dealing with it the idea that they will never get better. It makes them stigmatise themselves.,I wanted to buck this trend and try and get something out there that would give people living with psychosis, their families and those not yet affected by psychosis a chance to understand the illness without being scared by it. I wanted it to be memorable and I wanted it to be talked about.,Humour is something we can all relate to.  So I went about making something I hoped would be funny, whilst remaining inoffensive. ‘Psychosis Is Nothing Like a Badger’, the name of an animation I made in December, is my way of helping the world understand how Psychosis works, that its occurrence is something that could happen to anyone and that it doesn’t have to be permanent. That psychosis, in its own not-so-normal way, is perfectly natural.  , and talking is the only way that we can see a permanent change in the social climate surrounding mental health. Having recovered from years of continuous, debilitating mental health issues to a point where they’re still present but very much under control, I can safely say that talking is the best thing for anyone living with a mental health problem and for their friends and family. That stigma can stop this is unacceptable. It needs to be stamped out.,If you are interested in watching the video, it’s embedded below. I hope that it’s of some help to you and that, more importantly, it gets you talking!,

,"I’ve been struggling with mental health problems (anxiety and ,) since I was a child but they came on strongly again when I was 18.,At this stage my dad had a nervous breakdown and took time off work. At this point I was not well enough to work either. As I hardly left the house due to my anxiety I had to start caring for my dad as he became very depressed and started to drink a lot.  ,My health become worse and I wouldn't leave the house without having a drink. It was the only way I could cope with what was going on in my life and caring for my dad. ,When my friends saw I was struggling, I sat down and spoke to them about it and opened up. My best friend has always supported me from day one. She never judged me.,
I was working full time and I enjoyed my job and got on well with my work friends but as soon as I became ill everything changed. I tried to hide it from them and just go to work as normal. When I was having an ,, I asked them if I could go home as I was not feeling well. It took me four hours before they let me go home.,The next day I knew I had to face work and I couldn't so I went into my sister's room and cried to her saying that I couldn't go to work. I started to panic at the thought of going. She made me go downstairs and talk to my mum, who had no idea what was going on. I explained how I felt and she phoned my boss and explained that I wouldn't be in. My boss was not too happy about that and said “Well, Emma was ok yesterday. What’s changed?” ,I was signed off work for a week and tried to sort myself out. I just seemed to get worse. This is when my father become ill. I was signed off work for awhile longer and the only time I left the house was after a drink. I had to go into meetings at work after they had medical reports from my doctor to see how I was getting on.,One night I was spotted (by someone from work) while I was out with friends and I was called into work for another meeting. However, this time my boss gave me a disciplinary for going out but not being able to go to work. They had printed photos of me off Facebook to prove that I had been out with friends. This made me feel like they did not believe what I had said or what the doctors had said. ,I had not opened up to my boss about my problems as I did not feel comfortable talking about it. After this I felt that no one believed my problems or understood. I felt so alone. After a while I decided to try and go back to work. I arranged with my boss to work two hours a day to help me get back to work. I found it very hard but I did not want to give up. After a few weeks of being back at working doing  two hours a day, I was made redundant due to the fact they did not have a space for a part time position.,It seemed like I was fired basically all because of my mental health problems. I was very disappointed, angry and upset that I had been treated that way.,So at the moment I am now jobless but I have very good support from my loved ones, though I’m still finding it hard to travel and leave the house. I am also still caring for my father as much as I can as he lives in a different house now. With the support I have, I hope that one day I will get over all my fears and problems and be 'normal again', as I put it.,I do feel that there is not much information out there about mental health problems and how to treat people who are struggling with their mental health. People that do live with mental health problems , as they feel people will look down on them. It’s an issue of education, you can’t see mental health problems so people think that they don’t exist."
,"I come from the South Asian Community and lived in a very traditional Pakistani home. I balanced two contrasting lifestyles: one where I was expected to be a perfect daughter and sister doing all the housework and cooking from a young age and the other where I had an ambition to educate myself and be successful. My parents were supportive of my education as long as my role as a traditional Pakistani girl was not neglected. I successfully completed two degrees.,I have , and ,for most of my life without it being diagnosed. My depression increased as I became older, including my self-harming and two suicide attempts in my 20s. The last one resulted in hospital admission for one month. I was 28.,On reflection I had two big issues to deal with, one of culture and tradition and the other of my mental health. At that time I didn’t know it was referred to as a ‘mental health’. Why? Because there is no term for what ‘mental health’ is in Urdu or Punjabi.,In it’s literal translation it means something like ‘problem with the brain’, which implies ‘being mental/crazy’. In my experience there was a lot of ,, ignorance, discrimination and oppression against those that were identified as ‘mental/crazy’.,It is quite distressing even writing about mental health in this manner as it feels very demeaning and implies negative connotations. But that is how it is, even today in 2013. It’s a very sad, lonely and scary illness to be living with. No one ever spoke about mental health.,It was only something someone who is ‘mental/crazy’ has and those people are shunned and not spoken about in society. In my experience, this culture dictates that those people are ‘bad’ people, they must’ve done something wrong, they have an ‘evil spirit’. As a child all this was reinforced to me, indirectly so, but I identified with these ‘crazy’ people because I could see me in them.,I displayed various behaviours, signs and symptoms of some sort of mental health distress but it was never picked upon. I guess as time went by I tried to reach out but never got a positive response so I continued to battle it out in my own mind and through self-harming, which in various stages of my life represented the severity of my mental illness.,I carried on with my life and focussed all of my attention on my studies so I could get away from my mind and self. I was successful in my education and career but it was far from the actual reality I lived in: the one that was hitting rock bottom, the one where it felt right to take my own life. No way out. No one to talk to. It was a very dark time in my life.,I could talk to my friends. But the people I really wanted to talk to was my family. I just wanted them to ask me, ‘how are you?’ My second suicide attempt resulted in me ending up in hospital. The help of staff and my BME worker, who was from the same cultural background, empowered me to talk to my family.,The language barrier was so that I needed a translator to communicate what I wanted to say in Punjabi/Urdu because I did not have the words to express myself in the way I felt comfortable. Don’t get me wrong my Urdu and Punjabi are fluent but it felt more shameful to say it in my native tongue. Perhaps because that’s the culture I associate with discriminatory attitudes against people with mental health problems.,Regretfully, the translator did a terrible job. I can laugh about it now, as I’m in a better place, but at the time I was furious because I felt she did not convey what I really wanted to say. In the end my sister helped me to explain the concept of mental illness, self harming, suicide and the long and short term impact.,I felt like at times I was teaching them about a new phenomenon rather than having support from them. Although they listened and understood to a basic level, they were unable to help me. For them, I wasn’t ‘crazy’ in its obvious form, I was me. They don’t understand that I only need someone to listen to me and someone to talk to. My BME Worker helped me the most. She understood the mental illness and the cultural issues but most importantly she listened and was able to convey this to my parents.,I am still on a journey, slowly building my confidence so I can talk about my experience in a more positive way and help those from similar situation as me.,All I wanted from my family was for them to acknowledge my mental health problems, to acknowledge that I will have good and bad days, to talk to me about my feelings and emotions and to listen. All I really wanted was to be heard and understood. You don’t have to be Pakistani or English to do any of this. You just need to be human."
,"When I was 14 years old, the style of ‘emo’ was rife. Joke upon joke suffocated anyone with dyed hair and skinny jeans, most of them fixated upon depression and self-harm.,I had depression at this stage but for me it was all about avoiding the symptoms. If I felt emotional it was because of hormones, if I had no energy I should go back to sleep, If I couldn’t sleep it was because of my uncomfortable bed. ,Excuse after excuse led me to be the biggest hypocrite of them all. In school, it seemed that if you admitted you were , it was for attention. If you talked about your feelings you had been listening to too much MCR. And if you hurt yourself you should either ‘get on and do it’ or ‘stop begging for attention’.,And so I, as I’m sure many other teenagers did, ignored my problems and blamed it on me being weak. I even laughed along with the awful inconsiderate ill-informed jokes that batted around the school playground like a seemingly harmless bullet that really threatened to be fatal if it hit the wrong struggling teenage girl. ,I am 21 years old now, and although I was never a bully, I still feel ashamed for not having the courage to understand and relate to other children. And it wasn’t until only four months ago, with the support of my fantastic mother, I finally admitted to my problems.,I gave in to the care my mother was so eager to give to me and I went to the doctors and got diagnosed with severe depression and severe , as well as other symptoms we are yet to find the source of. I was also told the strange episodes I was having were either panic attacks or restlessness and violence due to my condition. And that the strange night time struggles I had were sleep paralysis. ,And although I thought I would feel weak and I thought everyone would just laugh in my face like they may have done in school, I feel stronger. I finally knew what all these worrying things were that were happening to me and I knew that it wasn’t just me who had them.,I may have to take a few pills a day but that gives me the better quality of life I have been craving and it means that I no longer have to pretend and put on a brave face for my friends. Because now, although they have decreased in numbers since school, they have increased in quality and they not only accept me but they help me. ,And sure there are the odd slips of the tongue. If I accidentally say I’m feeling nervous meaning little by it, I can see them all tense and repeatedly ask if I’m alright but that’ll wear off. The most important thing is I’m not alone and I’m no longer having to hide what I’m feeling. I’ve finally gained some honesty. "
,"Did you see the Homeland series on Channel 4? Or have you been watching Greys Anatomy?,These programmes have all opened our eyes to mental illness.,Often the fact that it’s difficult to , can be one of the hardest parts of having a mental illness.  It can lead to the loss of friendships, difficulties at work, feeling isolated, not seeking help and a much slower recovery. ,It doesn’t have to be this way. Talking about mental health can strengthen friendships, aid recovery, break down stereotypes and take the taboo out of something that affects us all.,People describe me as bubbly, outgoing, chatty, and colourful (amongst other things – my husband describes me a prickly!).  I am these things and I have also used these things to hide my pain.,I have been battling depression since my early teens, and three times so far it has put me in a place where I have been unable to carry on with everyday life and activities.,I am in a recovery period at the moment.  The last three years have been very tough for me.  Depression really grabbed hold of me in late 2010.  I felt detached from the world around me. I can't say I didn’t have any emotions, I did, but they all seemed desperately negative.  Mostly I was scared that I would never escape the depression and I would have nothing to give myself or anyone else in this world; I was completely worthless and everyone else had finally realised it.,My symptoms included restlessness, insomnia, I did nothing - I didn’t wash and I didn’t look after my home.  I didn’t feel that anyone would want to do anything with me, I was certain that everyone (even those I didn’t know) where staring at me and talking negatively about me.  Why would they want to be around me anyway, I was a terrible, awful unlovable creature!  ,I could barely remember things and in fact lost periods of time – which I still can’t recall now.  I caught (and still do in times of stress and difficulty) every bug going, my immune system was dire.  I ate and drank more and more and expended less and less energy.  When I cried, it was for hours and it was exhausting and painful.  I felt so negatively towards myself and my future.  I wanted to die.,Because it wasn’t ,, I was able to recognise some of the usual symptoms (as were my family and friends).  ,With the , who is very accepting, sweet and willing to stand up to the depression with me, I sought help and talked to my GP.  For me, both medication and talking therapy helps me and I’ve been using both to bring me into this recovery period.  I have made (and continue to make) lifestyle changes to support me in remaining in this period, though I’ve no doubt that the depression will come biting at my heels again in my future.  I hope that each time that it does I am better equipped to deal with it.,The workplace played a vital part in recovery from depression for me; recovery requires structure, challenge - to build confidence, some handholding, general support and lots of encouragement.  In the main, my company was supportive of me and allowed me to change my working hours to suit and I’ve had support from the company doctor too.  However I have also experienced stigma.  ,Challenging stigma has to happen on an individual basis, companies must adhere to the law, and people ‘seemingly’ don’t.  If we can challenge these individuals to better understand mental health then slowly we can change the culture of our society.  It was for this reason that I wrote this blog for my company intranet site.,The very nature of depression can prevent someone who's depressed from seeking help.  They will often withdraw from friends and relatives around them.  This is a time when they need your help and support most.  Perhaps the most important thing that you can do is to encourage your friend or relative to seek appropriate treatment or to visit their GP.,Try not to tell them to 'pull themselves together' or think that this is even possible (you wouldn’t tell a person with a broken leg to get up and walk would you?).  Praise is so much more effective than criticism.  You can reassure them that it is possible to do something to improve their situation, but you need to do so in a caring and sympathetic way.,People who are depressed need people who care for them.  You can show that you care by listening, sympathetically, by being affectionate, by appreciating the person, by practical means or simply by spending time with them.  Encourage them to talk about how they are feeling and getting them to work out what they can do, or what they need to change, in order to deal with their depression."

Finally – in about month 4 - I realised something: I was in control, nothing bad was going to happen, no-one would even know I had depression or anxiety.,I got up, got dressed and went to the supermarket with my mum. It felt amazing. Yes anxiety was still hanging around but I could actually feel the depression lifting. Day by day I did a bit more and each day I was feeling better. I returned to my job. However I was told I was no longer capable to carry out my duties as collections advisor. I was forced to leave. ,If I did not hand my notice in I would not receive any pay! This did not set me back.

When your family is in too much pain to talk about and remember her, so you start to lose your own memories?,It has been 8 years since my mum lost her life to cancer and I am only just starting to fully grieve for her.  At first I think I was in shock, despite her battling the illness for 9 months.  I developed a faulty coping mechanism by burying myself deep into schoolwork, then my degree and finally my dream job as a Primary School teacher.  ,All the time oblivious to, or rather stubbornly resisting, the growing , hiding behind the façade of the ‘determined and successful young woman, doing so well considering what she’s been through’.,Before Christmas I finally surrendered and broke down.

Although I worried about hurting other people in the process, depression made me too exhausted and desperate to truly care. , I believed that they would rather I was dead and be at peace rather than alive and suffering.  Besides, the last thing I wanted to be was a burden on other people.  Or worse – have them think I was exaggerating how awful I felt, being a drama queen and getting told to just ‘get on with it and stop making a fuss’.,A tiny part of me must have wanted to live, however, even on the darkest of days, as I confided in a few people who I genuinely thought wouldn’t be bothered whether I was around or not.

Also I now know it doesn’t have to be kept inside; I have no reason to be ashamed and embarrassed about having depression because it isn’t a sign of weakness.  In talking to people I have been rewarded with more compassion, understanding and love than I ever thought possible.,These people have given me another shot at life and no words or actions will ever be able to express the love and gratitude I feel towards them.,I wrote this poem in the midst of the darkness, when someone managed to get a tiny light to shine through.

,"When I was first diagnosed with depression and , I was incredibly fearful about what people would think of me and how they would react. ,The first person I told was my best friend and that was to seek advice on how to tell my mother. Being fifteen years old at the time, the doctor who diagnosed me said that I would need to tell my parents that , and was on medication.,  I remember feeling scared about this. I didn’t know how my parents would react and I was frightened they would think I was over-reacting or trying to seek attention. ,I also remember being annoyed at my doctor. I didn’t want my parents to know and I didn’t want to kick up a fuss about it. I just wanted to keep it private and to deal with it on my own.,When I talked to my Mum it was like an enormous weight had been lifted. She didn’t fully understand the illness and, in all honesty, neither did I. But I didn’t dwell on it. My Mum’s reaction was shock, I remember it clearly. I was usually a happy child but when I had my down day I would try and mask the feeling with a smile, hoping that it was just ‘the blues’ and it would go away soon. ,My Mum naturally had questions: how long had I been feeling like it, why I didn’t tell her sooner, what the doctors had suggested etc. I was treading on egg shells answering them, in case something I said would make her annoyed. But she never got angry. She was kind and tender.  She allowed me to talk about what had been going on in my life and we finished our talk with a hug and tears, a few tears on her part too.,The next few weeks my Mum was very supportive. She set me up with counselling sessions and paid for them by the hour. Although I appreciate the gesture, I never found them helpful. And, since I was under sixteen, a lot of what I said (well, the stuff that was ‘worrying’) would go back to my Mum and this made me dislike them a bit. I know it was in my best interest but I never wanted to get my family that involved in my depression, not then and certainly not now either.,My first priority in life is my family and friends, not myself. Therefore, I used to hide my feelings a lot from them, to protect them. Although I know this is not the correct thing to do, I do it anyway because I don’t want to be a burden to them.,I am a logical and rational person, I’ve been told that many times. Under pressure, I will know what the right thing to do is. When giving advice I will know exactly what to say or do. If I am being put in certain situations I will know how to handle them. However, when I slip into what I call ‘a mood’, my mind becomes completely illogical. ,I begin to think irrationally and I can’t stop myself from it. I will truly believe that I was not meant to be on earth, that, if there was a God, why would he give me life to only make me suffer even though I had never done anything remotely wrong. In particular, I would think that no one would care if I was dead.,I’ve written blogs when I’ve been in a mood before and it’s been shocking to know what I’ve been writing. I have a couple of examples from one I wrote a few nights ago when I was having a particularly rough night:,""I know it's all in my head but that's the most frightening thing about it. If it was external I may have some way of controlling or ignoring it. I can't control or ignore my mind. What it says to me. What it wants me to do. What it thinks of me. What it thinks of my existence. What I think of my existence.”,""I just want to live in peace. I can’t take much more, I’m not strong enough.”,These blogs are currently private but soon I want to make them public. I may still be afraid of talking to my family and friends about my illnesses but I want that to change. "
,"I could hear the sound of chatter and phones coming from the open window above me.  I was stood in the car park at my ,.  A place that I hadn't been to in almost two months since the doctor signed me off with ,., I'd heard through a friend who worked in a different department that I had recently become the subject of some contention and the cause of much tutting and eye-rolling.  I work in a busy environment and my absence was not well received. , I had recently been 'tagged' in a Facebook photograph at the beach with my children and there had apparently been cries of ""if she's well enough to go to the beach then she's well enough to come to work""., I understood their logic however, they were unaware that I had been persuaded for over an hour to leave the sanctuary of my bed and go out to the beach to get some fresh air.  They were unaware that I had fought back stabby, burning tears in the car on the way to beach, such was my discomfort at being out 'on display' in public.  They were also unaware that the sound of the seagulls ignited a panic attack that I, unsuccessfully, tried to conceal from my children.,I had decided to pop into my office to drop off my latest sick-note in person and say hello, show my face and hopefully have a bit of a chat about what was happening to me and why I was away.  I liked my colleagues and a couple of months ago, I was pretty sure that they like me too.  Now I wasn't so sure but hoped that I was just being paranoid (another delightful aspect of my depression).,I walked into the corridor and headed towards my office.  As I approached I could hear the familiar voices of my colleagues.  Some were laughing and bantering with each other, others were on the phone and I could hear others tapping frantically away on their keyboards.  I felt annoyed at myself for being so nervous about walking into a room that I had spent so many hours of my life in.  I also mentally chastised myself for thinking so little of my colleagues, surely they wouldn't actually think any less of me for being unable to work due to a ,?  I took a deep breath and walked into the office.,The voices that had been previously laughing and bantering went quiet.  I smiled a very wonky and unconvincing smile and after what felt like an age but in reality was only a matter of seconds one voice said ""alright?"" and then the laughing and bantering continued where it had left off.  I headed over to a girl who I often sit next to, saw that she was on the phone and gave a little wave and a smile to which she sighed, raised a quizzical eyebrow and shifted in her chair to face her back towards me.  I can honestly say at that moment, I felt the most shame about my illness that I had ever experienced.,I put my sick-note on my line managers desk and walked out, locked myself into the toilet and cried big ploppy tears into my lap.  The tears became sobs and I tried to stifle any tell-tale sounds of crying that anyone passing by might have heard.  That would be the icing on the crazy-cake, my colleagues discussing the fact that I had turned up, spoiled their conversation then hid in the toilet crying like a reclusive Moaning Myrtle.,When I felt like the tear tsunami had subsided enough for me to face the world again, I stood up and looked in the mirror.  A reflection that looked like a panda and Alice Cooper's love -child stared back.  I did the best I could to mop up the excess mascara, fumbled around in my bag for some lipstick which I slicked on hoping (somewhat optimistically) that the pink lips may detract from my fetching blotchy face and puffy red eyes and headed back to office.,My line manager was now in the office and was sat at her desk.  She smiled at me, got up and put her arms around me in what was a very welcome and hugely appreciated hug.  She told me very confidently that she was sure that I'd be 'on the mend' soon seeing as the current lunar activity was coming to an end.  I nodded sagely in agreement despite the bewilderment and irritation that her innocent but ignorant comment had caused me to feel.,She had been so nice by smiling at me, speaking to me and hugging me that I didn't want to appear rude or ungrateful by explaining that my depression was not caused by the man in the moon, I was also interested whether she was also convinced that the alleged cause of my illness was a huge ball of cheddar floating miles away as that seemed about as logical as her last comment but thought it would be rude to ask.,I stayed only a short while before leaving and heading home.  Disappointed that on this occasion my paranoia was for once, intuitive rather than delusional."
,"Many people would look at me and not realise I have a ,, I’m not a different species or a green spotted monster, the last time I checked I was still human. ,I am a 24 year old female, living in Yorkshire and enjoy music, art, reading, films and gaming. ,I have severe ,, ,, obsessive compulsive , and have self-harm issues and have done since the age of 11.,It’s only 3 years ago that I started medication and started various therapies, until then I had only told one person how much I suffered but didn’t want to seek help. So why did I leave it that long to seek help? Why didn’t I speak out and say I’m not ok? It was plain and simple, I was scared.,I was scared of the , that surrounds being diagnosed with a mental health issue, I didn’t want people to think I was “crazy, insane, not on this planet” etc. I was also scared of having to tell people that I wasn’t well and having to explain why I needed help. I felt weak, stupid, vulnerable, ashamed and frightened. ,Don’t get me wrong it was hard and sometimes it still is but I have a supportive fiancé, family and friends. It was difficult sitting down and saying “you know what I’m not ok, I need help and I’m scared” but it was one of the best things I have ever done, it was like a weight that lifted from my shoulders.  Now I choose what and who I tell and how much I tell people. It’s my choice and I no longer feel the need to hide behind closed doors like feeling like an alien not of this world.,My depression can fluctuate a lot and sometimes the smallest of triggers can send me into the deepest darkness but now I have the support structure in place I don’t have to suffer like I did. I can speak up and ask for help, a hug, to talk or whatever I feel will help. I have found that work helps a lot. It keeps me distracted from getting lost in my thoughts and keeps me in a routine. ,When I’m not working I am an artist. I can express how I feel, no rules, no words needed, just complete freedom to express my emotions and passions.,I’m still a regular human, I just have an invisible illness. I have different ways of coping with everyday stresses and my illness. For too long I kept everything bottled inside, didn’t seek help because I was scared of the stigma but 1 in 4 people have a mental health issue. ,I think people shouldn’t have to feel like they have to hide and fear the discrimination or the stigma, I think we should be able to speak about it like we speak about most illness, like the weather or what you watched on TV last night. Don’t suffer in silence, break the stigma and seek the help you deserve!"
,"I was first diagnosed with , towards the end of 2011, although my doctor and I agreed that it had manifested itself a number of years before I sought help. ,I had many theories as to why I had it, which included the fallout from my parents’ divorce and that it was in my family with my grandmother and cousin having been treated for it. I can remember, at the age of about 14 or 15, believing I had something ‘wrong’ with me and deciding to research my symptoms on the internet. ,My symptoms included feelings of extreme guilt, paranoia, worthlessness and loneliness. I can also remember ticking off each symptom that my internet search returned but I remained silent. It was like I felt guilty for believing I had a ,.,I now know that I went into a kind of denial, as I was frightened of actually being told I was depressed. People had even suggested to me that I may be depressed but I just laughed and brushed off their comments, too scared to tell them how desperate I was feeling.,After 4 years of extreme mood swings, alcohol abuse, self- harm, suicide attempts and a failed relationship I finally confided in a friend who advised me to speak to my GP. Even though we did not agree on a course of action immediately, as my doctor suggested that I have some time to think about what treatment would be best for me, just speaking to someone whom I knew could help me was such a relief. It felt like a weight had been lifted off my shoulders – a weight that I had been carrying on my own for too long.,The next year was not the easiest but, with regular check-ups with my GP and the support of my boyfriend and some family members and friends, the stigma of my condition was removed. I realised that depression is just an illness that requires treatment, like diabetes or high blood pressure, and it is a lot more common than I first thought. In fact, it is even dubbed the “common cold of psychiatry.”,If I were to give anyone advice who is suffering from a mental illness, or knows someone who is, I would say that talking about it is the first step on the road to recovery. Once that step has been made, the fear is reduced and now that I am not afraid of my illness I know how I can control it so it doesn’t have as much of a negative effect on my life anymore. Even though I am better now, I know that it may return one day. However, now that the stigma and fear are not there anymore, it won’t have the same negative effect on me as it did have when I first suspected that I was depressed. ,All it takes to feel better is one conversation with someone willing to listen and not judge, and from there, all the doors for support will open."
,"Struggling with , can often leave you feeling isolated, scared and unable to open up to others about how you feel. ,Aside from the difficulty of dealing with the illness itself and the isolating and dark feelings, I found I often felt ashamed of the way I was feeling and therefore wanted to hide away from everyone around me.I dealt with depression on my own for many years before I first started to try to approach others about how I was feeling. ,Having spent many years in school feeling very disconnected from my peers and finding socialising with friends and talking with other people around me really tough, I decided that I wanted to make people aware of what I was going through and to have a fresh start when I moved away and to university. The initial move was particularly hard and I think this pushed me even further to admit to others what I was going through.,I’ve received mixed reactions over the years from friends about my depression. ,Thankfully, the majority of my close friends have been absolutely wonderful and supported me all the way through - recognising when to give me space and when to step in and help. However, the reactions have sadly not always been as positive. I found some people tried to smother me after I told them and although it was because they were worried it left me feeling very patronised and like my friends didn’t trust me to look after myself. ,Other friends took a less caring approach and responded very negatively. I think the most difficult thing to deal with is when others, often unintentionally, make you feel guilty for being down or complain about how it makes them feel bad whenever you’re struggling. Although it’s incredibly difficult for all involved it often made me feel like I wanted to retreat even further into myself and contributed to my feelings of worthlessness. ,I also came across lots of people who didn’t recognise depression as an illness and became very frustrated when I couldn’t just ‘cheer up’ after doing something nice or having someone try to comfort me.,I came to realise in time that these kind of responses were due to the general lack of ,. Having the right kind of support from those around you is so fundamental in the fight to get better and so I felt it was of particular importance to try to educate people as to what illnesses such as depression actually are and to address some of the misconceptions surrounding them. ,With this in mind I decided to , talking about some of my own experiences. Since I began suffering with depression, I’ve started to recognise just how many people suffer with mental illnesses or know someone who does and. I think it is paramount that people begin to learn more about mental illness and to begin talking about it to eradicate some of the , and to help those suffering not to feel ashamed of themselves. ,It’s all too easy to forget that you are suffering from an illness and that it’s not your fault. Posting the video was very nerve wracking but I realised from the feedback that so many people had experienced depression themselves or knew someone who had and the positive response has pushed me further to start conversations about mental illness.

I have to honestly admit that I thought I would be facilitating the process of change for others rather than seeing any changes or benefits in my own life. However, the Man Enough project has taken me on a real personal journey.,Mental health issues have always loomed large within my family. Many of us have experienced episodes of mental health disruption and my great uncle took his own life when I was in my teens.,All of these events have affected me and yet they were (and are) seldom discussed in the family. Outside of my own family I witnessed a tragic suicide, being first on the scene. In the last year alone, 2 male ex colleagues have also taken their own lives. Time to change anyone?,My main episode of , happened around 12 years ago and , through this project has been of huge worth to me. It has allowed me to realise the gift of the experience (it resulted in me having to seriously re-evaluate who I was and what I stood for) and also to realise my passion for helping others in similar situations. It was extremely challenging however. I am used to running large training sessions for people who I consider my peers but actually talking about my own story in this way was more difficult (and more rewarding) than I thought.,Delivering the project has also massively changed my view of ,(although not my ability to spell it – thanks spellcheck for helping me there!) I had never encountered a person with the condition before. I had I think unconsciously adopted a view that they were , who should ideally be locked away and, if not, then certainly avoided. Meeting a young man with schizophrenia and observing his troubles but also what a genuine and gentle soul he is had definitely shifted my views.,I am looking forward to continuing work on the project and to enabling the volunteers on the project to hopefully have as meaningful and rewarding an experience as I have.,I also think that within our modern and “civilised” society, we perhaps need to look a little deeper at how we chose to live our lives. In 2011, more men under 35 died from suicide in the UK than road accidents, murder and HIV/Aids combined. Men take their own lives at a rate 3 times that of women. Something is clearly not working for men. I was recently asked to , talking about this issue."
,"I'm self employed as a singer songwriter which I have been most of my life. I've had some chart success in the year 2000 with a group called Artful Dodger singing their chart hit ""Please Don't Turn Me On"" reaching no. 4 in national charts in the U.K. I also teach students, sharing my knowledge for singing and my experiences in the music business.,I was , and , over 10 years ago after finally reaching out for help. I realised that I couldn't get through this alone and that maybe, after years of fighting this illness, attempts to take my own life and self medicating, I didn't have the strength to do it anymore.,The overwhelming feeling of being alone crippled me. I spent days on end in bed getting up only to use the toilet. I spent countless days just crying; crying all day wishing for someone to save me.,People , can, from the outside, seem very self absorbed, selfish and inconsiderate but, trust me, when you feel so much emotional pain that it becomes physical, that your heart at any moment feels like it could fall into the pit of your stomach, there is no time for anyone else. ,When I did manage to go out it was about getting what I needed as quickly as possible with little eye contact, no care for what I looked like. I had turned into that person I used to see as a kid, hair uncombed clothes, dirty and ruffled... that was me.,People who are different are often scary. People like to put things in boxes so they can have an organised view about life but that's exactly what mental illness isn't. It isn't organised and box like, one condition alone can have so many layers and complications which can change from day to day.,I learnt quite quickly that getting better is a gradual thing and that there is no quick fix.  Some things were immediately really helpful though, like knowing that I wasn't alone, knowing that there were people out there like me (lots of them) and, mostly, it was so helpful to know that I had someone to talk to and help me understand what was going on with me. And that was a huge step in the right direction.,Once I began to understand more about my condition, I then felt I had to try and educate others around me which at times was truly frustrating and at disappointing. I felt and still feel at times that folk would rather I didn’t talk about it, often changing the subject at the first opportunity. I again began to feel alone and frustrated at people’s reaction to my honesty about what I'd been through. Friends fell away leaving just a handful and even family members stopped communicating with me and turned their attention to my wife who I suppose in their eyes was still ""normal"".,It takes time patience and perseverance to take those steps that make change. It's taken me a long time to get where I am today but I'm working again and feel really good about my achievements. I found that the doing has to come from within, only you can take those steps to heal yourself and even though at the time they seem minute and pointless steps eventually, eventually you will walk again.,I think , stems from a lack of knowledge and understanding of mental illness. I think a lot of people who have had no knowledgeable contact with anyone living with depression or other mental illnesses are genuinely scared. We all knew someone growing up who was labelled mad or different and we were always told to keep away from them, as if they were likely to freak out at any moment and bite off your ear off. The truth is that people with severe mental illnesses are more likely to be victims – rather than perpetrators – of ,.,I've finally achieved a life-long goal of mine, which is to make a record of songs about my life and experiences. It's taken me a while but it's here now, I'm here now. There's a song called , which is about that helpless feeling I describe and with some help from friends I've made a video that is due for release soon. 5 years ago I wouldn't have dreamt of successfully coordinating a project like this, stretching my mind to organise and multitask. So please listen, I hope you enjoy and thanks for reading my story.,Lifford Shillingford is on Twitter , and you can find out more about his music at "
,"I’ve , for what feels like forever but in reality it’s 5 years, though that’s still a quarter of my life so far.,I spent these years smiling and pretending everything was alright to friends and family and not letting onto people what I was feeling deep down-the curse of the “smiling depressive”.,Even when I finally told my mum, I stopped her from telling my dad and didn’t tell the doctors more than they needed to know. I was sure I could do it alone.....,I went to university and was still afraid of showing my true feelings but I worked up the courage to seek help from student support. Talking to someone regularly started to help me work through what I was feeling but I still couldn’t break the smile that I hid behind.,When I turned 19 things started to get out of my control. I was self harming much more and developing an eating disorder but I was still in denial as to how bad things were. I went on for another year still hiding it all from family and friends until it got to the point that my eating disorder meant I could no longer hide. My parents realised how bad things were and I finally told my dad about my depression. However, I still went about things on my own and told my parents things were getting better.,A few months later I was admitted to hospital for a week and I was so worried what people would think of me being in a psychiatric hospital. If anything, it made me realise how important true friends and family can be. My parents came up to Scotland from London to rally around me and stayed up here for a year after to give me support. My friends visited and were there for me more than I thought could be possible.,I’ve never been so glad to have such support and only wish I had realised sooner that my parents were a solid rock I could rely upon. They have helped me beyond words and their love for me has never faltered. Despite having , I’m still the same girl to them.,I was so afraid that the stigma of a mental health diagnosis would be so strong, that my family wouldn’t understand and just think me to be weak. Now I realise opening up and talking about mental health is probably one of the best things I could have done when feeling so alone in the world."
,"I first became , at around 19 years old, when I was taking a lot of recreational drugs. After 2 bad experiences with acid, when the , turned to despair in a matter of weeks, I went to the doctor and my mum came with me. I had to see 3 different doctors before anyone took me seriously.,Telling people that I was depressed was difficult. I didn’t understand it myself but I thought that drug use had upset the chemical imbalance in my brain so I clung to this idea. It was much easier for people to accept that I had a chemical problem rather than anything emotional. To be honest, I didn’t find very many people sympathetic at this point: ‘What have you got to be depressed about’ or, from my mum, ‘If anyone should be depressed it should be me.’,When I tried to say it was a chemical imbalance to a friend of mine who is a psychiatric nurse, she tilted her head to the side and said ‘no, but really, why are you depressed?’ and that was the first time I actually thought about it. But it was as if she’d asked me the question in Chinese. I didn’t have a clue what she meant.,My boyfriend at the time just thought I was a killjoy and couldn’t get his head around why my sex drive had disappeared overnight.,Two things helped me recover from that bout (apart from the anti-depressant, which seemed to wrap my head in duvet and give my happiness a ceiling that I couldn’t penetrate – but which helped save my life.) The first one was finding out how many other people my age were depressed too; that it wasn’t just me. That was an enormous relief. The second one was ,.,It’s a cliché now when discussing depression, just because it’s so true. Talking about it helps. The person you’re yammering away at (in my case, everyone, even check-out girls) doesn’t have to say anything back. They just have to nod occasionally and not want to run off (check-out girls aren’t allowed to!) Interestingly, having depression helped me to figure out who my real friends were – who were still around when I became more normal.,I’ve had bouts of depression since then but I know what to do now. I write about it, I tell people, I force myself to go outside and talk to people and get involved in things. Most of all, I be gentle with myself and remind myself how great I am. The episodes became fewer and fewer and now I’m like an eagle scout, taking my body and my mind seriously and listening to whatever I’m telling myself I need. It’s what everyone needs really – support, encouragement and love."
,"I was diagnosed as having , and , when I was 14 years old after years of very strange behaviour had gone overlooked but everyone in my life. My parents were both , and unable to communicate that with anyone, so we were three individuals all struggling in the same house, in our solitary bubbles. How sad and unnecessary that seems.,For many years I lived much as I imagine a closeted homosexual might, “There’s something different about her but we can’t quite figure it out.” There was no way I was going to ‘out’ myself, for then it would be official ‘Merrin is crazy.’ But as time went by I thought surely it’s better that people see that it’s got a name, it’s a medical condition so therefore it’s not my fault I should just tell people and they would accept me, right?! ,But the word ‘depressed’ is used in such a flippant way, as many words in our language are these days. It has been watered down to the point that when it is used it is often not taken very seriously. ,Even if people do want to understand and push through what seems strange to them there is no logic to ,. If I told people I had diabetes, epilepsy or even cancer then there some point of reference but “oh you can’t get out of bed in the morning!? Well join the club!” “Can’t bring yourself to eat?! What a great way to lose weight!” “I don’t like myself!” “Well who does?”,I can totally understand people’s confusion. Depression makes no sense. On the surface it’s not logical in anyway. So how can we expect people to ‘get’ us when the main problem, is that we don’t ‘get’ ourselves.,Over the last few years high profile performers have come out and shared their struggles with self worth, that even through all that fame and money they can’t always cope with themselves. Let’s hope this continues and that it does make a different to people’s perception of mental illness.,I have a dream that I have a lovely husband, a large group of supportive friends and a career that is both challenging and rewarding and I don’t think has should have to be a pipe dream for me. ,Though I have never had verbal or physical taunts I have had many people just give up and put having me in their life in the ‘too hard’ basket.  In hope of finding a new me, new start, new life I have relocated many times in my life but of course everywhere I go, there I am. ,I don’t know how those with mental health issues can truly integrate into society or what allowances really need to be made. What I do know is: no more running. There is no magic wand and I have to keep dealing with my secret inner life on my own for now, one day at a time and that’s tough."
,"It was a huge step; packing up my belongings and leaving to go to university 200 miles away from home. I was excited but terrified. I was leaving friends, family and a boyfriend of 2 years. I was sure we could make it work long distance.,The first 6 or so months of my university experience were thrilling and an adventure. I was learning a subject I was interested in, meeting new interesting people, learning how to look after myself and doing it all in a big happening city. Living with 11 other people was a bit like Big Brother at times, but was an experience I’d never forget. My boyfriend was even talking about moving up, after he loved it too after his visits, and we were starting to look for a flat together. Out of the blue, he broke up with me. It was a messy situation but my new friends helped me by listening to my heartache and taking me out to parties. At the end of that year I couldn’t face going home for summer, so looked for a job and moved straight into a flat with a few friends. ,I did go home for a few days and went to visit my parents.  My dad didn’t look himself and was coughing and out of breath. He said it was just a cold; it definitely didn’t look like one. My mum and my brother took him to the Out of Hours, while I was told to lock up the family business. They returned later that night without my dad, they had kept him in still not completely sure what was wrong with him. ,I stayed home as long as could, but had a job I started on the Monday and couldn’t afford not to take it. After a few days of my new job and living out of the poorly stocked freezer, I got a call from my mum. Things had got worse with the whole situation. I spent the last of my money on a train ticket and headed home. My dad was still in hospital, suffering from pulmonary embolisms and my mum in the meantime had found debt letters that my dad had hidden or left unopened. My mum had made the decision to leave the family business and move into my grandma’s house. I helped as much I could. My mum cried on my shoulder caught in between worried about losing my dad, but also not being able to trust him again. Everything was a mess.,After a while my dad started to recover and my parents started to rebuild their life together, with me returning to university. I hadn’t cried at anything that had happened with my family and was starting to feel numb. It was months before I started to think there was something wrong with me. I would lie on my bed staring at the ceiling with hours going past, be unable to sleep or concentrate so my course work was going downhill. I didn’t feel right, but didn’t have the energy to properly notice. It took a friend to notice my state and got me an appointment for a counselling session. I really didn’t think I needed to go and felt awkward talking about things. She said that I was ,, which I didn’t believe. I knew what depression was but I didn’t know it was the way I felt. People use the term so loosely that I didn’t feel I could tell anyone, for fear of judgement even if I did have it.,I vividly remember the moment when it finally dawned on me that the counsellor was right about my illness and that I really needed help. I was walking down the street to a lecture and almost got ran over by a white van. The first feeling a well and functioning person gets is relief and a racing heart from the shock. I had none of that, no relief, no shock, just an inbuilt bitter disappointment that the van hadn’t hit me. I knew I needed help, and went for more counselling and started to get treatment for my illness.,It was a tough road as I felt I could only talk to one friend about it and the only counselling session I could ever get was during lecture time. Everyone on my course just thought I was a massive skiver; no one could see how I really was due to the fake smile I would force on every day. Through the counsellor’s advice I did tell my parents about my condition but only in letter form. It felt like a weakness and that I had failed at life to let everything affect me so much, so couldn’t tell anyone about it. ,After not doing too well in my exams that year and being told I couldn’t do honours because of it, I went to see my advisor and told him about my situation. I then went to see my course advisor and took a letter from both my doctor and counsellor to back up my story. I later received an email stating that there was no room on honours for me and that I would have to take an alternative route. At the time I didn’t want to speak out about it as I was ashamed of my own condition but as I get older and wiser,I realise that discrimination of those with , is much deeper  than I thought in individuals and within companies or institutions.,These days I still live with mental illness, but know it as an illness. I take medication and take time for myself. I have since met people who have went through similar experiences, which has been helpful. It is definitely nice to know that you are not alone and mental illness is more common than would first think. I have made an effort to talk about my illness, but there are still people that don’t know.  My advice for anyone living with mental illness is to talk about it. Don’t take as long as I did to accept help."
,"When I said, “Yes, sure I'll write a blog” about my , I didn't realise how scared and nervous I would be when I sat down to put pen to paper.,Really, what on earth could I say on this topic, that hasn’t been expressed or experienced by millions of people before me, right here on this site?,Strangely enough, the question answered itself very simply, “I don’t!”  At best, all I can do is add my voice to the conversation and hopefully help raise awareness in some little way.,So I thought I’d write a short blog about how profoundly pervasive and dangerously discriminatory the societal stigma, public ignorance and political indifference that surrounds mental illness truly is. , Mental illness is not caused by personal weakness, but rather, by a very complex interplay of genetic, biological, social and environmental factors.,Of course, my natural inclination as a writer of sorts is to hide behind metaphoric visualizations that make perfect sense to me, but at the same time remain vague enough to be left open to interpretation by others. The perfect cop-out. The perfect disguise…. and truth be told that is what I want to do! But somewhere in my panic I knew it would serve no purpose. Sometimes, the truth is nothing more than a statement of fact, and with that said, the first inescapable truth I want to share is simple; I have a mental illness called depression.,The second inescapable truth is - I wish I didn’t! Not because I'm ashamed, but because, much like many other illnesses or diseases out there, its symptoms, whilst not always easy to isolate, recognise or describe, are profoundly emotionally, physically and socially debilitating., Given 1 in 4 people will , at some point in their lives, it’s fairly safe to say it does!,Actually I just lied… There are indeed times where, despite daily medication and a great psychiatrist, the culturally ingrained badge of shame and entrenched dogma that erroneously surrounds depression still manages to hold me captive. Inside, yet outside myself, I unknowingly become my own worst enemy; the proverbial judge, jury and accused all rolled into one. Unblinking, unequivocal, unrelenting and worst of all unapologetic, guilt, uselessness, embarrassment, insignificance, isolation, hopelessness, emptiness, abandonment, detachment and self loathing shine their fraudulent omnipresence on everything I hold dear and BANG…,THE FLASHBULBS GOES OFF!,BANG! “It’s all in your head.” BANG! “You’re a danger to society.” BANG! “You’re stupid and will never amount to anything.” BANG! “You’re a lazy scrounger.” BANG! “You’re spineless and weak.” BANG! “Come on, pull it together- it’s just a matter of willpower.” BANG! “You’re just feeling sorry for yourself.” BANG! “You’re bonkers...off your trolley.” BANG! ” You’re ugly.” BANG! “Of course, nobody likes you.” BANG! “You’re a waste of space and better off dead.”,I hold myself captive,Of course, you might say I sometimes feel that way because I’m prone to depression, and you would be correct, but only in part. I would argue that if we lived in a more informed world where ,, political indifference and judgmental ignorance were NOT ALLOWED to continually propagate negative and inaccurate mental illness stereotypes, people like me would:,In short, if stigma was just simply an issue of public perception I might be tempted to say “oh whatever”, but it isn’t. An all too often invisible, yet powerful bully, it’s real menace lies hidden in the fact that it prevents people like me from seeking treatment, and that without question steals away hope, ambition, dreams and even in some cases, life itself.,No one needs to live in a world where the future is their enemy, or breathing nothing more than an obligatory survival technique that gets them through the day, and no-one needs to ever read another stupid headline that describes someone’s’ passing as “a successful suicide attempt”, All I can say is, tell that to Winston Churchill, Tennessee Williams, Buzz Aldrin, Emma Thompson, Stephen Fry, Lord Bragg, Dame Kelly Holmes, Charles Schulz, Sir Isaac Newton, Gail Porter, Mark Twain, Lenny Henry, JK Rowling, Sir Anthony Hopkins, Trisha Goddard, to name but a few.,So as scared as I am about what other people might think about me right now– let me state again … “I have a mental illness called depression.” I didn’t choose it, it chose me, but guess what – I’m choosing to talk about it., Not if you have it!"
,"At the time, it was becoming harder not to feel lonely. It was becoming harder not to lie down in my bed at night and not spend hours staring at the ceiling. Usually this wouldn’t be such a bad thing, usually, this would be quite refreshing to sit and think – but what about when your thoughts no longer occupy your mind, what about when your dreams no longer excite you enough to close your eyes?,You’re entering a state of mind where you’re finding yourself shrugging at everything in a half-hearted manner, shrugging at everyone around you – shrugging at life. You’re unable to drag your feet out of bed in the morning, because sleep seems more appealing. Unable to stare at the mass of photos pinned to your bedroom wall like you once used to, because you know you can’t really speak to any of the faces staring back at you anymore.,It angered me that it came to this, the fact that I was nineteen years old and had ‘depressed’ hanging over me like a cloud. In my head I hated myself more than anyone but I hated everyone else too. I was constantly back and forth. I couldn’t understand why I had to take tablets to make myself feel better; surely that wasn’t how this was supposed to work. Surely, happiness was having friends and a family that loved me? Why wasn’t that enough? ,I kidded myself into that being the answer, how could anybody love me? I was a mess. So I blamed them, those so called people I call my friends, the fact they wouldn’t ask me when I was sad the real reason behind it. It’s was as though I could feel a wall physically going up around my heart and around my brain, I could feel myself slowly backing off from everyone and becoming simply unapproachable.,I did try, though, sometimes. I blurted out snippets of information, cries for help, until I realised no one was listening – that they’d heard it all before. Or they assumed the rest of the story for me. I almost yearned for those drunken nights where I could say anything and blame it on the alcohol, those nights where my best mate finally cradled me in her arms and stuttered out an apology. Yet, I always knew no matter how many times she did it, it was never really an apology to me, more so an apology to herself about not having the guts to say anything sober and how guilty she felt. ,They didn’t understand that my frame of mind looked at them like they owed me more than that and I eloped with my selfish, depreciative bubble: the one that no one else was invited to, the one where no one knows the full story, my story. The story I only trusted myself with.  ,The anger began to eat away at the sadness; I became convinced people weren’t worth trusting. There’d always be something said in spite, something personal used against me. I immersed myself in my mind, forgetting about my heart. I became part of the furniture, just something and someone that sat in silence. ,I couldn’t say anything to make them understand, and I couldn’t help feeling like the disappointment – not only to my friends, but to my family."
,"Six weeks after giving birth to my second child, eighteen months ago, I was diagnosed with ,.,I don't remember a great deal about this dark time to be honest. I had half worried that my GP would tell me to pull myself together and send me on my way. Luckily, he was (and still is) incredibly supportive.,I was prescribed Citalopram and slowly started feeling better. Just over a year later I felt it was time to stop taking the medication. My main reason for this, rightly or wrongly, was that I wanted to know that I could ""do it on my own"", without depending on chemical assistance.,I was feeling fine, in control and back to normal (whatever that means). So under my doctor's supervision I weaned myself from the tablets. It didn't take long at all before things really fell apart for me in a big way.,I'd been getting worse and the familiar dark feelings had returned when there was lovely news. On the evening of the opening ceremony for the 2012 London Olympics my husband and I went to meet our newborn nephew in hospital.,I remember walking through the post-natal ward and feeling some really horrifying memories come flooding back. I felt like a panic attack was on its way but I did my best to push it away. We met our beautiful nephew and went home.,It was then that I really went to pieces. Crying hysterically and not knowing what to do with myself. I had so much anxiety in my head that I remember literally feeling like I wanted to remove my head and wash it out, strange as that may sound. It was just awful.,The following day I was back on my medication but it took quite a while to start feeling normal again. My relapse came with the new addition of extreme anxiety, for which I was also prescribed beta blockers, and eventually Cognitive Behavioural Therapy to help me cope.,Six months later, I'm pleased to say that I've finished my course of CBT and am no longer taking the beta blockers as the anxiety is under control.,One of the things that really helped me get through this dark time was reading. There are so many incredible blogs out there, where people speak honestly and truthfully about what they've been through. I hid my , from almost everyone in my life, even my closest friends.,In my experience, PND is very closely tied in to feelings of failure as a mother. I felt that admitting I had it was like admitting failure and inadequacy. Like I wasn't good enough for my children and I didn't deserve them.,About a month ago I decided to share my own truth by starting a blog. It's called ,. I ""came out"" about my PND which was a big shock to lots of very important people in my life.,Some of my closest friends felt very hurt that I hadn't confided in them at the time. I had to explain to them that it wasn't that I didn't trust them, far from it. The reason I was unable to tell them was that I knew the advice and support they'd offer, but I wasn't able to take it on board or accept their help at the time. I suppose I didn't feel worthy.,I think that PND can really damage a woman's sense of self-worth. Other than having my children, I haven't done much in the past few years that I have felt proud of. But, dare I say it, I am proud of my blog.,The response to it has been incredible. I have had messages of congratulations and support from strangers and also heart-felt confessions of depression from people I've not seen for years. People have told me that in reading my words they feel I've visited their inner thoughts and written them down. To know that sharing my story is helping people is amazing.,But my blog is not just about me. I want to encourage mums to stop competing and comparing with one another, realise that we're all in this together and can help one another. I want people to read it and realise that, despite outward appearances, lots of people are going through struggles that we know nothing about.,A few kind words from you may be the only nice things they hear all day. Your smile to a stranger on the street may be the highlight of their week. Someone you know may well be putting on a brave face but screaming inside. By being kinder to ourselves and each other, we really can change the world. I think it's Time To Change. Are you in?"
,"For me, having Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder (also known as ,) means I care deeply about what others think of me. At every opportunity I believe that people are ridiculing me, that they can’t be bothered with me and that I’m a burden to them. Like many people suffering with a , I’m brilliant at hiding how I’m really feeling; I don’t often jump at the chance to discuss my problems because I worry they’ll be interpreted as a sign of weakness or incompetence but it’s time to change!,After graduating from university I found a job within three months and couldn’t believe my luck! I wanted to lead a normal life, have a job, rent a flat and save enough money to travel. I hadn’t planned on telling my employer about my mental health problems; however, I was devastated when, on the first day, I had a ,. I explained to my supervisor that I suffered with , and , but didn’t go into any detail. He was understanding and assured me that everything would be fine; unfortunately, as the weeks progressed, I became increasingly paranoid.,The office environment was stressful for me; people were constantly talking negatively about one another, I didn’t feel as though my job was secure, I found it difficult to distinguish what was appropriate conversation and what wasn’t. People would keep asking me why I wouldn’t eat at work during the day, not realising that I have an eating disorder. I hated walking through the office because I couldn’t stand the idea of people staring at me. This made simple tasks extremely difficult, such as using the scanner, photocopier or talking to colleagues when I needed their help.,I experienced regular panic attacks which were distressing and difficult to control. I was told unsympathetically to ‘stop crying’ and ‘calm down’ by a colleague who didn’t understand what was happening. On another occasion when I became upset I was told to ‘go home’ and ‘not let the rest of the office see me like that’ because it looks ‘unprofessional’.,""Things would be a lot easier if I tell them about my mental health problems,"" I’d often think to myself.,I was scared about telling them in case they thought I was being pathetic. When they’d make negative comments about mental health I’d become embarrassed and change my mind about telling them. If I’d have been more confident I’d have challenged their attitudes but I was only twenty-one and in an office full of more experienced colleagues who were at least twice my age. I still should have said something.,After six months my mental health had deteriorated considerably and I was forced to take time off. The thought of going back to work frightened me but I couldn’t help feeling pressurised to return as soon as possible. I felt guilty and frustrated with myself. Eventually I resigned; I had no idea how long it would take for me to be well enough to return to work.,Twelve months, eight hospital admissions and countless mental health workers later I’m still struggling to cope. I hope that, in the future, I’ll be able to talk about my mental health openly with friends, family, colleagues and employers. It’s such a huge part of my life that it takes too much effort to keep it hidden; besides, I have nothing to be ashamed about."
,"My mother realised ,long before I did. In fact, I think I was the last person to acknowledge my depression existed, possibly because it became so severe so quickly.,It all spiraled out of control very suddenly. What had doubtless been an underlying problem for many years suddenly flew out of control in the space of a week after an ugly, cruel and unexpected break-up.,Within a week I’d attempted suicide and ended up in hospital where my heartbroken mother stayed by my side, keeping a brave face on everything in front of me, in spite of her shock and pain. In the following weeks, when , or to seek any help, she was there all the time – on the phone, coming to visit or arranging for friends to suddenly drop round.,This carried on for three long and painful months, until I tried again to take my life. This time it took days to regain consciousness and longer to regain my general senses. I was in hospital for a long time. I was numb with pain and grief and consumed with fright, self-loathing and a terrifying hatred for everyone who was trying to help me, including my mother, who refused to go away.,I behaved appallingly such was my desperation not to be alive and my anger at my mother for calling the police to break into my flat and save me. While I was in hospital she was by my side every waking moment. She went to the café over the road to bring food more tempting than the hospital’s offerings, not that I’d eat anything.,Even after all this, I refused to accept I had depression. Someone like me (with a high-powered job, a nice flat, good friends) wasn’t ‘mental’. I knew nothing about mental illness except what I’d seen on TV – which I now know to be really unhelpful. But at this stage, if you’d told me I was mentally unwell, I’d have thought of Arthur Fowler in , smashing up his house in a fit of depression and being sent to the “funny farm”, or the Angelina Jolie character in the film Girl, Interrupted. Neither of these characters seemed to bear any similarity to how I was feeling.,The over-stretched nurses weren’t getting the message through to me, and the hospital doctors had no time to talk to me, they just wanted to dish out anti-depressants and get me out of their ward.,But my mum knew I was depressed. While I was in hospital, she was busy gathering information where she could – from books, from leaflets, from the internet, from ,. And while the nurses and doctors were letting us down, she was filling the gap in my medical treatment.,Within weeks, my mum became an expert on depression, ways to treat it and different approaches to try and help someone living with depression. She patiently waited until I was feeling stronger before encouraging me to work with the various therapists she had independently found and urging me to speak to the supportive GP she had unearthed.,It took well over a year before I was standing on my own feet again and able to move out to live independently again but there’s no way I could have done it without the support and unconditional love of my mum.,Over the following years, and up to today, my amazing mum continues to prop me up and hold me together. Although I’m thankfully so much better now than I was a few years ago, like everybody, I still have my ups and downs and my mum is always there for me. We’d always been close but this experience has really created an extra bond that we could never have anticipated. I owe her everything.,(I’d like to add that, although my experience of that hospital’s doctors and nurses in terms of mental health was not brilliant, I’ve since had some really positive and excellent experience with NHS doctors and nurses.)"
,"I have suffered on and off from , for over 10 years but have, in spite of serious losses, soldiered on and I am now a professional facilitator of well-being. When I saw an opportunity to write a blog I was excited to share my experiences to help others.,When I read that the purpose of the blog was to share experiences of , I became less enthused. I didn't think I had any examples and so had second thoughts.,Suddenly it popped into my head that the reason why no examples came to mind was because I had experienced , stigma so consistently and for so long that I no longer ever thought about it as an issue.,Having to hide the emotional difficulties I experienced had become a way of life. When I was first prescribed anti-depressants during my gap year at the age or 19 I was determined to make sure nobody found out. This was in-spite of the fact that I was abroad and lonely and desperate to have someone to share my difficulties with.,I think people feel better saying that it is only from a lack of self-confidence that one is reluctant to be open and share the truth about their emotional state. That the fear of being judged is only in our minds and that in fact there would be no negative effects at all from sharing the truth. But from my experiences ....that is sadly not true.,I was 19 years old. It was my gap year. I had gone abroad to study with a few friends and having already been there 5 months I had made a lot of new friends as well.,I was well known and well liked. I was confident, funny, energetic, smart and opinionated (in that good way!) and a talented singer (which made me even more popular...I still don't get why that should be the case but that was the way it was). That was the way everyone there saw me including the lecturers. And that felt great.,Then, as if from no-where, these feelings overcame me. Feelings that were so bad that I was mostly unaware of the thoughts that must have been creating them.,These all consuming negative feelings began slowly but built up a fairly rapid momentum that meant, within just a couple of weeks, I went from the girl everyone knew and loved to ""has anyone seen Sarah lately?"" My room-mate obviously saw a change in me and tried a few times to speak to me but I shut her down saying that there was no point in speaking, no one could help me.,But everyone else, my 5 other flat mates along with probably another 20 or so friends on campus, literally were asking around ""where is Sarah""?,You see we had this unused ""storage"" room that was occasionally used to hang up laundry but was primarily abandoned. This is where I escaped. I would crouch on the floor and just cry, rock and cry and want to die. I couldn't explain the feelings I was having to myself let alone to anyone else.,All the friends I had there (probably over 20 girls) all had hearts of gold, and I was fully aware of this. I knew that they would want to help me. But I thought that if anyone saw me in that state...they would decide they were in way over their heads, they would as I saw it ""give up on me"" and feel that their only option was to call the head of the university to take over the situation.,I couldn't face that. I was already suffering so deeply I couldn't bear the thought of being considered too insane to comfort and re-labelled from the fun and easy going Sarah of the past 5 months, to the ""sick Sarah"".,Somehow I felt that no matter what healthy side people saw of you or for how long, as soon as your unhealthy side made an appearance - that was who you really were.,I was desperately trying to hold onto the complete opposite: that the healthy Sarah is the real me and the depression is not me and, with a little time, love, support, patience and confidence from others, it would soon die away to once again reveal the true Sarah.,I really felt that as long as I didn't have to face a new label of ""sick Sarah"", I could brave the storm of the depression and then, once the storm cleared, walk out of that storage room with my head held high, no-one the wiser! In order to get through the storm...I needed some love and support."
,"I first decided it was time to talk to someone about the way I felt just after I turned 16. I’d had , and had been self-harming since I was 14 and it was getting worse and worse.,So I turned to a pastoral support teacher at school. I had spoken to her before so knew that she was lovely. However, once I was sat down with her I found myself completely unable to talk to her.,In the end I just rolled up my sleeve and showed her. I regret doing things that way now as I don’t think it was fair on her. Fortunately, though, she was ok despite being shocked. At first I felt like she was angry at me for doing it, she got me to see the school counsellor and I didn’t speak to her for a while, until I bumped into her outside of school one day and she asked why I hadn’t been coming to see her.,I had kind of assumed that she didn’t want me to anymore but after that I started to speak to her again and she helped me out a lot just by listening and being comforting. At the time I didn’t exactly realise that depression was my problem, I blamed my self-harming on my dad being ill, so I guess, although that possibly wasn’t helping me, I wasn’t entirely honest.,Sadly this particular lady left our school. We stayed in touch a little though which is great. Once she left the school things got worse as, shortly after, the counsellor who also helped me left too. This meant that I was made to talk to a community school nurse who didn’t react so well to what was going on. She was a little bit too pitying of me and often made it seem like I was doing something wrong, which isn’t what anyone with , needs.,In the end my school broke my trust severely. They had warned me that if I were to say something to make them extremely worried they would have to tell my parents. I was ok with that because I knew I wouldn’t say anything to worry them. Then, just before the Easter holidays the school nurse came to talk to me, she said she was telling my parents.,I couldn’t believe it. I was terrified and furious at the same time. I had given her no reason to tell them and when I asked her why she said that it was because I would have no one to talk to over the 2 week holidays and it wasn’t safe. I was so angry. That wasn’t a reason she had mentioned before and I felt totally betrayed.,I got home the night that my parents had been told and my mum was very upset. I didn’t know what to do and so I lied. I told them that I had only ever self-harmed once and that it was ages ago. They believed me and we never really mentioned it again after that day. Things got much worse from that point. I started to self-harm more and more and I was totally alone for a long time as I had lost trust in everyone. I thought of suicide every single day and objects around my house stopped being just ‘objects’ and started being things I could use to harm myself. I still feel like words cannot justify how dark and awful that time of my life was.,A few months later I spoke to an adult friend. It was so hard and I was so scared my trust would be broken again but I am so glad now that I told her. It turned out that she had been through very similar experiences when she was younger. She convinced me to go to the doctors and came with me… twice.,Things were still very tough for a while after that as I was waiting for counselling for a while, although my friend was there for me a lot, but after a while in counselling things did start to improve for me. I went for a year in total and for about a year now I have been feeling so much better. I feel strong now. I can’t say that I never slip up or have days where I find life overwhelming but those are just bad days now and don’t have the dark depressed feeling that used to hang over me all the time.,I am 18 now and am back at college (after dropping out the previous year due to depression) and I am happy! I truly think that talking to anyone can help a mentally ill person so much; I don’t like to think about where I would be now if it wasn’t for my friend, I feel she saved me."
,"It was when I was at college that I realised why the , attached to , has made my recovery, and is making the recovery of many others, so much harder than it should be.,I had had an , from a young age after suffering abuse as a child. It took me a long time to open my eyes to the fact that not all eating disorders are the way that the media portrays them to be. I later started to suffer with ,, alongside an eating disorder and ,. I stopped leaving the house, left college, and pretty much stopped living life how it should be lived. Soon after I was diagnosed with ME, which further added problems.,I have just dropped out of college for the second time, as I simply cannot deal with the added pressure and comments made to me. I wasn't Hannah. I was 'the girl who doesn't bother to turn up half the time'. I felt like my identity had been stripped away from me and, like many of you know, adding more self hate will not help you get any better.,It never ended: I’d miss a week of college and would study at home. I would then come in the next week, sit a test on it all and get an A. The girl next to me with 100% attendance would get a C but she'd be praised. However, I would just be repeatedly told how I was going to fail, how I had to 'force myself' to come in more, how I needed to 'try harder'. When all I wanted to do was scream back 'open your eyes'. Surely my wellbeing should be more important than your statistics? ,It got to the stage where it was easier to not come in and I found myself hibernating away in my room more and more. The constant feeling of not being good enough further made me feel even less myself, which is when my eating disorder hit its worst. Before my AS exams, I snapped; I was studying so much I wasn’t sleeping, I was so low that I didn’t eat for days and ended up in hospital.,The college reacted to this by sending me yet even more work and the negative comments didn’t stop. Amazingly I managed to do great in my exams, which were 3 weeks after I went into hospital. My second year at college was no better, even though I proved I could do it. The point I’m trying to make is that I should have been talked to and given more support before becoming that ill just. I was still Hannah, I still had an identity and was still a human. Having mental health problems does not make you any less of a person.,On the bright sunny side of life, there is so much in life to see and to live for, no matter what happens and even if the tunnel at the end seems blocked, you can come out of it such a strong person. Even if your accomplishment of the day is brushing your teeth, you are doing so well. It doesn't matter how long it takes as long as you get back up. I have had so much support but stigma and discrimination can still make recovery so much harder."
,"Friendship isn't always easy. I first learned this as a three-year-old, stepping into a prized Wendy house at nursery school, only to be told (by a slightly bigger tot), 'You can't go in there!' My first memorable friendship snub - ouch!,In the years since then, I've thankfully learned to take the knocks. I've also concluded that whilst life is about finding kindred spirits with whom to share positive and hopefully meaningful times, it's also about navigating your way through tricky scenarios - the assorted land mines laid down by life. The Wendy house-type confrontations and, of course, much, much bigger stuff. These situations, the challenges, I think most would agree, are the true test of friendship.,For people like me who've , (in my case, , and ,), it feels like these tests have come thick and fast. After all, there is arguably no greater test of friendship than the randomness that can accompany mental ill-health. And that randomness - certainly before diagnosis - tends to prevail.,Over the years, I've definitely lost friends and marred relationships as a result of being unwell. I count myself among the three-quarters of people who've experienced a mental health problem who have lost friendships as a result of their illness (a statistic revealed by the recent ,).,To be fair, in my case, these relationships existed in something of a pre-diagnostic fog - these friends probably didn't realise I was sick, and for many years I didn't realise how seriously under par I was either. We were all fumbling around.,Even if they had known I was unwell, I'm sure some of these friends would still have found it hard to cope. Some people can and some people can't. Not everyone has the inclination nor the ability to stick around for someone who, it transpires, is fighting large-looming mental demons. I say this with no value judgement. There are lots of things I'm not too good at either.,Not just that but I think it's easy for mental illness to masquerade as rudeness, self-indulgence and an inability to keep your 'chin up' when other (healthy) people appear to navigate life so effortlessly. I can see that friends who are well may find it easier to draw a line under your friendship and take it elsewhere when it all looks so self-absorbed.,To the outside world the solution may seems obvious - over the years I've been told to 'do something nice for someone else' during my darker times and to 'have a manicure' or 'have a haircut' to make myself feel better.,I appreciate these were suggestions that may well have worked for a well person who was simply having a 'bad day'. Now I'm so much better, they'd probably work for me, too - not so when I was seriously depressed. Actually, the realisation that these suggestions weren't going to work for me made me feel a whole lot worse - I was a bigger failure and more beyond help than I already thought.,And so, over the years, some of my friendships fell away. Some may have naturally done so anyway as life experiences took us in different directions. But in other cases, friends probably felt they'd done with trying, that the friendship was barely reciprocated and that they were drained and bleached by the continual process of being there. It would seem it was all too much. I can really understand that.,The other surprise, though, is that I've got this far, to the age of 43, with plenty of quality friendships to my name. Luckily, during those desperately ill moments, although I may have lost some friends I also gained some incredible ones at unexpected times and from unexpected places.,Amongst them there's the wonderful work friend who was at the end of the phone at all hours, telling me to 'keep it in the day' when I spooked myself by envisaging blackness forever.,There's the neighbour who would allow me to sit in his house and just 'be' when I felt like I could tear my own skin away for sadness, not to mention the friend who would tirelessly invite me for Sunday roasts when I felt like all my favours were used up but I couldn't help myself.,Then there was the playgroup friend who offered to come to the psychiatrist with me when I first got my bipolar diagnosis - a courageous and most welcome act from someone who had known me for so little time. She sat with me afterwards in a London cafe as we gripped each other's hands and toasted, through tears of relief, 'new beginnings'.,All of these brave acts of friendship are things I will never forget, words and deeds I think I'll always feel indebted for.,Like all of us, I'm still learning about the highs and lows of friendship. But now I'm feeling so much better, I'm hoping I can increasingly become that 'available' friend of the kind who stuck around to help me. I'm humbled by the generosity and resilience of these unexpected pals. If I can be half the friend they have all been, I'll be on my way to doing OK."
,"Since 8 years old my twin brother and I together ate, drank and breathed football – it was pretty much our life. Joined at the hip, our love for the game both playing and watching continued until late teens. Unfortunately, as a result of a series of traumatic events, my twin , – and 14 years on, continues to suffer from the taboo , within football and our community.,I was left feeling completely shattered and broken. However, as a carer, it is this very situation that gives me the strength, motivation and willpower to continue as an individual within the professional game, especially as though it is something special that we once shared. My twin is the reason I became engaged in football and, despite the circumstances, continues to be my inspiration in wanting to do well in all aspects of the game. They say ‘god gives his toughest battles to his strongest warriors’ and in some respect, without this mental strength, carrying out many roles and responsibilities would be extremely challenging.,Statistics suggest that 1 in 4 people will experience a mental health problem in any one year. Mental illness affects all races and ethnicities. Yet how many can honestly say that the issue is openly spoken about, understood and accepted within the ,? There is a huge stigma attached to mental health problems which is a barrier that is stopping people from speaking out and seeking help.,It is not merely people with direct experience that are affected but those that act as ‘carers’ too, for instance family members. From personal experience, the ordeal is life-changing and can have major implications on family lifestyle. With my brother requiring 1 to 1 care, we did speak out and seek help and as a result we work closely with charities Life Ways and Mind, who provide some home-care. The consequences for us as a family were that my mum reduced her working hours and my dad’s work now provides flexibility. I share caring responsibility and my younger sister, studying Optometry at University, will help during weekends.,Responsibility is not solely with the ‘caring’ aspect, but also the day-to-day running of a family household and general lifestyle – we simply cannot ‘go out’ as an when we like, things need to be pre-organised to ensure there is always someone at home with my brother. As a family, we work as a tight unit and I have strong belief in moral duty. Hence, I have also broken the taboo of being 32 years of age, living at home unmarried. My family is my upmost priority and I have confidence and faith that my brother will regain a ‘normal’ life.,My message would be, if you can show great strength in character, nothing is impossible. Had we not spoken out, we may not be receiving the government care that my brother is entitled to. For me being able to , as a vehicle to overcome a difficult situation is a wonderful thing – something that I have done and continue to do. If I can find an inspiration from this ordeal, then those of you in a similar situation can too. It’s about time the taboo and stigma towards the issue of ‘mental health’ is addressed. Don’t suffer in silence. It’s time to talk, it’s Time to Change.,Follow Manisha on "
,"Sometimes life can be pretty paradoxical. I have ,, mild , and I used to have , so bad that I was agoraphobic and could hardly leave my house. Despite this I have always had a desire to perform. In fact, I am a puppeteer and puppeteering has changed my life for the better.,Sure, I still excessively worry when rehearsing and performing and I do understand that it's a bit weird that I like to be in front of a judging audience, when I use too much of my brain worrying about what people think of me.,But it is something I've always wanted to do. During my most anxious time at school, drama was the only lesson I would go to without having a debilitating panic attack. It was the only lesson I would go to in the first place!,Drama and particularly puppetry drive me to work hard and make me confront some of my deepest anxieties. I still get anxious but it feels worth it because I have so much fun doing it.,However, the most rewarding thing I have gained from doing puppetry is I have finally found a way I can sincerely express what it feels like to have a ,. Which, I'm sure you'll agree, is so important.,It started when I was puppeteering on a piece that tackled a serious semi-autobiographical story. I realised how puppetry was not only a beautiful art but could give a person the chance to explore their trauma.,I then remembered the metaphor that Winston Churchill gave his depression: the big black dog. This metaphor has no personal detail but almost instantly a person can imagine what it would feel to have a big unfriendly dog in their life and, in turn, they could maybe imagine how it would feel to experience a depression like Churchill.,This idea melded with my passion for puppetry. If I could build a big black dog puppet and give it life, I could maybe physically show depression instead of explaining how it felt. I could show depression as physically real. And isn't that what everyone who has a mental health problem wishes they could do?,So, I started to think about my own metaphor: Sometimes I saw my mind as like the weather; unpredictable and constantly shifting from the good to the bad. With some friends, I started to experiment with shadow puppetry and my overhead projector. Eventually, I managed to produced a short film. It was exactly what I was looking for.,But it felt like my experience was only one of thousands. So, I started the , to collect more metaphors and maybe (eventually) create a show with puppets. ,I want to do this because it's important for me to tell people about my anxiety and I want to help people talk about their own mental health. I feel that if people know, then it's not something I have to hide. But on the other hand I'm scared of telling new people, employers etc.,My project has helped me to open up about my anxiety. Instead of jumping in with, ""hi my name is Joni, oh by the way I have anxiety!"" which never works, I can say, within the natural flow of conversation, ""I'm doing a project on mental health with puppets… I have anxiety you see...' ,I've found now that I can be more honest, other people feel that they can be honest with me. I've been blown away with how people suddenly feel comfortable to talk to me about their own or a loved ones’ experiences after I mention my project. (Turns out we all have a voice, we just need to feel safe to be able to speak!) And that's the reaction I’ve had from just talking about my project. Imagine the power of actually seeing the puppets!,The benefits don't stop there! Puppeteering calms my mind. With all the focus puppetry requires, it acts like a sort of meditation, something I've never got the hang of.,What is important is that I have been able to combine something that I love to do with something that has had quite a negative impact on my life. It is liberating and rewarding to find my own way of expression, especially for something that can be so hard to express. ,I would really encourage people who are struggling with mental health to find a way of communicating their condition in any way they can. Life is hard enough when words have the potential to leave you feeling stigmatised. Draw it, paint it, act it, write it, film it. Find your metaphor for how your mental health feels! "
,"New research has shown that only one in four people who have experienced a mental health problem have received a get well card during their illness, even though 80% say that a card would be a good way for others to let them know they are thinking of them.,Our bloggers have written about their experiences of both receiving cards when they are struggling with their mental health or sending them to friends, family and colleagues.,Contemporary British artist Stuart Semple and cartoonist Stephen Collins have created exclusive ‘, - send them to a friend you know is going through a mental health problem and let them know you are there for them.,1. ,

I even got get well cards and my friends wrote me letters to cheer me up. One rather special friend even wrote on a wooden spatula and decorated it rather nicely! I stuck it to my wall (with permission) so I could look at it every day and smile.,Being in hospital for any reason can make you feel isolated and lonely, and it’s no different when you are in hospital with a mental health problem. When I was in hospital suffering with severe , and suicidal thoughts I found the support from my friends and family invaluable, and it’s the little things that cheered me up. I found night times the hardest because my favourite nurses had gone home. Nights stretch out and it’s always hard sleeping in unfamiliar environments. I would miss my family and my home comforts, and it was at these times I would re-read letters from friends and look at my cards. I couldn’t have got through that time without them. I looked forward to visits from friends and family and often they would ring me beforehand to ask if I wanted any magazines or chocolate. It was my lifeline to the outside world and at times kept me feeling sane!,I don’t see why people with mental health problems should be tiptoed around. You’d get a card or a present for someone with a physical illness, so why not someone with a mental illness? It lets them know that you care for them and are thinking about them. That way they can approach you when they feel comfortable for a chat.,Having said that, I think I’d have a giggle if I walked into a card shop and saw a “Hope you recover from your depression soon” card!, ,Getting a card in the post is exceptionally nice, it’s also now increasingly rare; it’s easier to send an email, a text message or an e-card, which is lovely but not quite the same. An actual, physical card lets you know someone cares about you, and was thinking of you long enough to decide to send a card and get round to actually sending it.,My mam has been sending me cards ever since I left home. Whenever she felt like it or, more often than not, whenever she felt like I needed it, she’d send me a little something. I’ve had cards to say happy new home, cards to say happy new job, cards to say sorry you lost your job, and cards to just say ‘I’m thinking of you’.,Many of these cards contained a few lines; congratulations, commiserations or how are you? There must have been hundreds over the years and I’ve kept many of them, because they were souvenirs of a particular life event, or just because they were funny, interesting or touching.,In 2007, when I was diagnosed with Generalised Anxiety Disorder and Depression, the notes in the cards got a little longer and their arrival became a little more frequent.,In amongst the swirling mess of being newly diagnosed with a mental illness – coping with doctors’ appointments, researching treatment methods, wondering how and when to tell people, all alongside trying to continue with what used to be your life – it’s nice to know someone is thinking about you.,I doubt very much that there will be a new industry springing up around greetings cards for mental illness – So Sorry To Hear You Have An Anxiety Disorder doesn’t sit that well as a headline above a picture of a kitschy kitty – but there should be a rise in the number of cards sent to people with mental illnesses from people who are thinking about them.,That’s the problem with a lot of cards, and card manufacturers; they can produce some very cute cards which, in certain situations, might seem a little glib; ‘this picture of a sad dog made me think of you coping with depression’ isn’t a great message, nor would it be a particularly good seller.,The message could be a problem too; normally when someone is ill and we send them a card, it’s to wish them a speedy recovery; ‘get well soon’, but with mental illness, that’s probably not likely. Mental illnesses are complicated and the process of recovery and learning to cope is long if not endless, so ‘get well soon’ is not going to work.,Much as there are people who want to ask questions about your mental illness, there will be supportive friends and relatives who want to do something to say they care, and I think a card is the perfect way of doing this.,The cards my mam sent me were never your standard ‘get well’ cards, she chose art prints that we’d both like, or humorous cards that might raise a smile, and the message inside was generally along the lines of ‘you sounded a bit down the other day and I thought you could do with cheering up’.,I loved those cards more than I can say; they let me know that someone cared, that I wasn’t alone and that, actually, I could be cheered up, even if it was just a little.,For me, one of the worst things about experiencing anxiety and depression was the feeling of isolation and loneliness. Sending a card to let someone know that they’re not alone could be one of the best things you can do to aid their recovery and support them as they cope with mental illness.,Don’t worry about standard ‘get well soon’ cards though, or about how much detail you need to go into about what they’re going through. Just send something funny or something you’ll both appreciate and tell them you’re thinking about them, it really is the thought that counts., ,Have you ever wondered at what point it is appropriate to send a get well card. Is it when someone is hospitalised? When they’re too ill to get out of bed? Or is it dependent on the illness itself?,The answer I have discovered, for me, is when you feel it is appropriate to do so. Whether someone is off work with a severe cold or undergoing surgery I know in my heart if it is fitting to send a card.,In our era of modern technology sometimes sending an email or text is appropriate, I know a lot of my friends would appreciate that and I know some, that would instead very much welcome a card.,Sometimes you have to question, what would I expect from people if I became ill?,So, I’m sat at home, signed off sick by my GP. It is my second week away from my job. I had been sent home by senior management as I was ‘unfit’ for work.,The thing is, I really wanted to be at work and as I sat at home watching endless episodes of daytime television I began to wonder if those at work missed me as much as I missed them.,During those first couple of weeks only one person got in touch with me and this one person continued to do so consistently for the next 6 months too. A couple of other colleagues also got in touch as the six months went on but what was at the forefront of my mind was why, when I felt so incredibly unwell did my workplace as a whole not acknowledge this too.,On reflection, the answer was simple. I was off work with a mental illness. I was in the depths of depression and had lost the ability to cope on a day to day basis.,I never expected the world to stop and pamper to my every need but a little acknowledgement can go a long way.,After my return to work, when I became aware of colleagues with physically illnesses receiving cards and even flowers I began to realise more and more just how much mental illness is still seen as a taboo subject in some places of work.,I wasn’t in hospital, I wasn’t undergoing surgery but no comparisons can be made from one illness to the next. If a person is at home, feeling lost, lonely, afraid, worthless and in the depths of despair don’t they too deserve kind words exactly the same as someone who feels physically unwell?,There are always the same excuses; what would I write, what would I say? What if I upset them more by such a kind gesture?,From experience I would suggest this; you would write that the person is in your thoughts, that you are wishing them well and some may be surprised to learn that no, you won’t upset them more, you will actually brighten up their darkest of days.,I did receive cards in that time of sickness from close friends and when I sink to them low points even now, I still receive these kind gestures from the same people; always the same people. Some of who have experienced mental health issues and also from those that haven’t, but either way it means the world to me. Whether it’s a get well text, a humorous email or a card that contains the kindest words it makes me fight this illness another day because it shows me I’m worth fighting it for.,To send someone a card costs less than a couple of pounds, for that person to receive it; is priceless., ,Having experienced depression, it would've been a lovely lift to know that someone had brought a get well card to lift my mood. After all that is the main reason why we buy get well cards in the first place, to lift someone mood. Since having a mental illness I have made so many friends who have been and are in still in the dark places we experience in life. But have I gone out and brought a get well card for them? Well the answer is no but tomorrow will be the start of many cards sent to friends that I have now made through this awful illness.,If someone had been in hospital you would generally see get well cards on the table next to the flowers. I don't think many if any of my friends have received this kind gesture after being been hospitalised while dealing with a mental health illness. My wife and I have had our issues with mental health but why didn't we buy each other a card? I've done so in the past for other problems that have affected my wife.,Until my wife had postnatal depression I was uneducated about what we know now as an illness. While there were so many “good luck” and baby cards, my wife would have kindly accepted a get well card too. Something saying ""get well soon thinking of you"" or ""you know where we are"" would have brought a smile to the face of my beautiful wife.,In any card sent to me I would have wanted to see positive messages of hope or positive quotes about life’s struggles. So my answer to the question is that I will be queuing up in the card shop tomorrow morning and will be giving this kind gesture of a simple get well card to the people who it is meant for: people with an illness.,Name: ,
Twitter: ,  ,When I had an operation 3 years ago I was really touched and amazed by the cards, get well wishes and offers of help with housework and food shopping.,The reason for the amazement was that I'd been out of action several times before but had never received all this fuss. The other times weren't due to physical illness though but depression. I’m unsure why people don’t send Get Well cards for mental ill health. Perhaps they feel it’s inappropriate or awkward and easier to keep their distance. Or maybe it’s because people feel mental health is a private matter and that sending a card would seem intrusive. Perhaps it would even seem patronising or sarcastic?,Whatever the reason, it would actually mean so much to me to receive a card when I’m unwell with depression. I keep some of my Birthday cards up for months after my Birthday, as I find that looking at them really helps get me through when I’m feeling really low or having distressing feelings. Even if I feel lonely and unable to connect with people, they’re a reminder that these people care about me and that I must have some value.,My ideal card wouldn’t necessarily be a traditional get well soon card but a humorous one. I’ve found that even when I’m really low, humour seems to be able to cut through my low mood and help to relieve me from my negative feelings for a moment. One of those vegetable pun cards with a funny caption underneath would make me chuckle, even if it’s just on the inside.,It would be really helpful to have a personal message of support inside the card. If you’re stuck for what to say perhaps just remind me you’re there if I need you, offer a chat over a cuppa or just some quiet company watching TV…and that you mean it. My depression will probably make me assume that you don’t and for that I’m really sorry.,Don’t worry if you seem to get no response. Depression can numb the emotions and communicating can seem totally beyond me but the card will have been really appreciated. I really would like your support but I might not be able to face seeing you just yet, so following up with a text the next day would keep the talking open and reinforce that the offer is still there until I’m ready.,A Get Well Soon card could act as an ice-breaker to what can feel like a difficult subject to talk about. It could also be a lifeline in a distressing time and the trigger that helps your friend ask for and accept support. So why not give a card to a friend or loved one who is unwell, whether it be from a physical or a mental health problem?, Michelle,Whilst I was signed off from my Teaching Job with stress, anxiety and depression I received through the post a collection of handmade Get Well Cards from my Tutor Group.,At first I was really touched and pleased that my form had been informed that I was off ill and not just left wondering what happened but what quickly followed was extreme guilt... as a teacher in a challenging school being away for even a day can have a very negative impact on the children and having been off for quite a substantial amount of time the guilt hit me like a ton of bricks; a series of negative thoughts followed: 'I am selfish', 'I’m useless', 'fancy putting those poor children through this and the staff', what must they be thinking of me?',This was accompanied by 'The replacement tutor is probably better than me anyway!' 'The replacement tutor probably forced the pupils to write the cards! They don’t really care!' 'The whole school would be better off without me',All these thoughts can take place within a millisecond in my head! A devastating millisecond! And as a result I binned the Get well Cards!,The other Get Well Card I remember opening was whilst I was in A&E, it was from my nieces and that had a different effect. It was a feeling of guilt but a more positive kind of guilt (if there is one) I suddenly thought 'Yes maybe someone would actually miss me'. It's odd because I had my husband, friends and family around me (upset) at this time and couldn’t feel a thing, I was oblivious and I didn’t really believe their grief but this card made me feel needed.,I would say that Get Well Cards are lovely and its nice to receive them when you are suffering from a mental illness because it reminds us that mental illness is a valid illness but its important that they are sent whole heartedly and not just because you feel you should.,: ,When I first had a manic episode back in 2003 I received loads of ‘Get Well’ cards and this really cheered me up. As I was in hospital and had been for the last 3 weeks, I felt that people were thinking about me through this difficult time. It also gave me hope and contact with the outside world as you feel totally isolated when you are stuck in hospital all day every day.,The messages were full of encouragement and offered me support whenever I needed it. I had the cards up in my room so I could look at them every day and they filled me with positivity that I would soon be back home and start to rebuild my life.,Since then I have had a few more episodes and ended up in hospital. I have not received cards this time, which disappointed me a bit – they probably didn’t send them as my family and friends were hoping that I would be out of hospital and back home quicker than last time. But I still felt a bit down and alone. I had visits but when everyone goes and you are left in your room alone its nice to have a card to look at and read the comments made to cheer you up.,I think it is really important to send ‘Get well’ cards and don’t feel it makes a difference whether it is a mental or physical problem. I see a card as a reminder that someone is thinking about you. My ideal card would read – ‘Thinking about you – we are here to help and offer support if and when required. You are not alone ……’, ,I received a get well card from my college friends on my 18th birthday in 2012. I had fallen ill at the beginning of the year due to the stress of college and moving from one mental health service to another. I had only recently been diagnosed with , and was still trying to recover from my last relapse in the last few weeks of 2011. I had started to develop , what only made my situation worse, but nobody had believed me or thought that it was that serious until it was too late.,I don't remember much of the first three months that I was ill, only that I had said some horrible things to some really nice people and had almost successfully committed suicide before my birthday. I had unofficially dropped out of college and tried to lose all contact with my friends, my lowest point being when my mother had turned to me and said that she couldn't deal with my behaviour. She had begged my mental health doctors to throw me into a mental ward for the time being. I had screamed at her that she was a terrible mother for not wanting to help me through this, and I still regret telling her that.,I had started the long road to recovery when I received the get well card. At first I thought it was another card celebrating my birthday, but I noticed that it was from college and my first thought was: “Oh gods, they're going to all say they don't want me there anymore because I'm mental...” but my father was with me so I had to open it. And even to this day I'm glad that I did.,The card was really funny and inside it everyone in the class had written from top to bottom how much they hoped that I'd return soon, that they missed me and wanted me to get better as soon as possible. Some messages were sad and some were really funny. I know on such a day like your 18th the highlight of the day is supposed to you be surrounded by your friends and buying your first drinks, but the highlight of my day was receiving that card. I remember crying until I couldn't cry no more. But it was tears of joy, not sadness.,The fact that they still remembered and had forgiven me gave me the strength to keep on fighting my Bipolar Disorder and eventually I went back to college to complete my diploma in the Performing Arts. I feel that one of the main factors of my recovery was definitely the fact that they sent me the get well card. It really helped outweigh the negatives. A few weeks after I received the card I returned to college, caught up with my work and obtained triple distinctions at the end of the academic year.,As the main message on this site is: Don't be afraid to talk about mental health, talking about it helps. It can make the world of difference to someone if you do speak to them about their problems. I know full well how scary the thought is of saying something wrong. But if they are your friend, they should understand., Laura,If you friend has just had an operation or is recovering from flu you’d probably send them a get well soon card, I know I would but what if that friend was struggling with a mental illness? Is it acceptable to send a card? They are still ill does it make a difference if it’s physical or mental? Is it the right thing to do? This is a tough question and I have a hard time answering because I think it all depends on the individual who isn’t well.,A couple of years ago I had a bad breakdown, I couldn’t work for a few months, I barely left the house, I isolated myself from my friends and family. At the time I was having a hard time coming to terms with the fact that I had severe depression and was so ashamed of being labelled with a mental illness that I wanted to hide it from everyone. At the time if people asked me why I was off sick from work, I said it was stress, exhaustion or anything else that would avoid the dreaded big D word, depression.,I didn’t want people to know that I was mentally ill, I didn’t want people to act differently towards me or try and talk to me about it, I definitely struggled with being offered support. The thought of someone knowing I had depression and sending me a get well card was embarrassing, I don’t know if my work colleagues at the time knew why I was not able to work but I received a get well card from them all. At the time I felt quite indifferent about receiving the card, I thought it was a nice gesture that they were thinking of me and wishing me well but on the other hand I was anxious about what and how much they had been told, what they thought of me and did they think I was crazy? Even now I’m not sure whether I could say it was the right thing to do, it had positive and negative effects and if they hadn’t sent one maybe I would have thought they didn’t care?,On the other hand from those people whom I kept my illness from of course I didn’t get a card and I know that was because I kept from them, that was my decision. There were a couple of people who were aware and didn’t send me a card but that was ok, they were there if I needed them and they showed support so I knew they cared and to be honest not getting a card made it feel less awkward. I’ll admit in some of the darker moments I did second guess whether they cared but looking back now I know they did and it was just the depression making me doubt my friends feelings towards me.,If I had a friend who was having difficulties with a mental illness I would send a card, unless I felt that it was completely inappropriate after all I don’t think there should be a difference between someone with a physical or mental illness. I would send a card full of encouragement and support, I would empathise having some knowledge of what it’s like to have a mental illness and yes I would wish them well soon. It’s still a difficult decision to make because it does depend on the individual but I personally think that it shows you care and you are thinking of them.,Depending on the situation you may have to be careful what your message sounds like to the receiver, I know suffering with depression I often get told “oh you’ll be fine, don’t worry, you just need to snap out of it” that doesn’t help. The message needs to be empathetic, something like “I hope you start to feel better soon, I’m here if you need to talk, I’ll be thinking of you” etc. Again the message would depend on the illness but just remember to be sensitive and don’t be patronising.,I did not receive a card but I remember telling a friend that I was really low and she sent me a little piece of paper and chocolates in the post.,The paper said:,""A little hug,
Whenever you are feeling sad,
and things aren't going right,
and your usual happy smile has slipped right out of sight,,
here's a little hug form me if,
I cannot be there because I want,
you to know just how much I care."",Underneath there is a photo of a teddy with his arms open.,This gesture was so touching and although did not heal me I felt like someone cared for me and I was not alone., Claire,When you think of buying a Get Well Soon card, you’ve probably got a friend or relative in hospital that has had some kind of injury or illness. I’ve never had a stint in hospital, so have never received such a sentiment. Nor have I ever received anything similar when I was at the height of my depression. I wondered why this was for quite some time and was initially quite stumped as to why it doesn’t seem to be as commonplace.,I then gave it some more thought, thinking about the kind of ailments that Get Well card recipients might have. A broken limb, chest infection or perhaps surgery. Each of these conditions and their derivatives have a definitive outcome – you will get better at some point. It’s pretty much a certainty that with the right care and medication, you won’t be suffering for long.,Mental health however, is a completely different beast. There isn’t a magic course of medication that can ‘clear it up’, nor is there a specific type of physical action (like surgery) that can cure it. It is vastly dependent on getting the right help and support. So perhaps some people feel unsure of sending Get Well Soon cards since it’s not perceived as something that will be over soon? I don’t want to sound negative but the cold, hard fact is that a mental illness isn’t likely to run its course without specialist intervention. I asked myself how I would feel about receiving a Get Well card and realised that, from the sender’s point of view, it may feel like pressure. The mind works in very different ways in someone who is living with depression, for example, and it can be all too easy to slip over the line while trying to carefully toe it. I think I would rather someone pick up the phone and ask how I’m feeling. Maybe if cards said ‘I hope you’re feeling better soon’ I’d not feel as pressured by something as simple as the almost commanding words; Get Well Soon. Get well soon or what? What happens if I don’t?,This might seem excessive, to think like this. But it’s important to understand the fragility of the mind of someone that is mentally unwell. There’s a chance I might feel differently if I had received a Get Well card while I was signed off work. Maybe I would have graciously taken the sentiment as it was intended – with kindness.,My advice if you know someone that is mentally ill? Sending a Get Well Soon card might just be better than sending or saying nothing. I would have loved to have been given a card that told me I wasn’t alone and the world as I knew it would still be there waiting for me when I found my way out of the darkness I was living in. It’s quite specific I know, but depression is a lonely experience. They don’t make cards for these circumstances, but to remove the stigma I think it’s important to start thinking about mental illness in the same way we do about physical illness – it is an ailment that requires medical intervention., Jess,I'm one of those people that still likes to get mail through the letterbox, as well as in my inbox. For this reason I also like to send cards and letters. The number of people I write to has dwindled as my grandparents generation are no longer living, but I still enjoy writing to people and take every opportunity to do so.,I've never sent a 'Get Well' card to someone living with a mental illness (and I've never received one either, though I have had the occasional message from people to say they're thinking of me). I'm not against the idea in principle, just not sure it feels right. Mental health, for me, feels to be more of an ongoing story. It wasn't a case of necessarily reaching a fixed recovery point of 'being well'. It was more of a journey to understanding, which I'm still on, and always will be.,Rather than sending a 'Get Well' card, I like to send cards of support, to let people know I'm thinking of them ( I know how much this can help, especially when people feel isolated or alone in their suffering). There are lots of great cards out there. A couple of examples...I particularly like some by Amy Rubin Flett, one says 'she decided to see how her life would change if she dropped the assumption she needed fixing'. I also like ones by quotable cards.com, especially 'this is my wish for you'.,I often adorn my cards with fun and friendly stickers, such as flowers or butterflies. I look for quirky, humorous or inspiring ideas. I also have several cards on my mantel piece at home. They remind me of whats important and keep me focussed on my priorities (friends, family, me!),Basically, when I write to people, I'm sending a hug through the post and hoping to surprise someone and raise their spirits. I want them to know I care, and that they do not suffer alone.,I personally have never received a get well card for my mental health issues; but then again I have never received one for physical health issues either. To be completely honest it probably has to a lot to do with the few people I choose to tell about my past depression and my current anxiety.,As a whole I think there are two main things that stop someone from sending a get well card. The first being that sending a card would be drawing attention to an issue that a lot of people would rather not talk about and that they either don’t see as an illness or don’t know how to talk about it. The second reason is that there are no appropriate cards. Most of them tend to say ‘Get Well Soon’. Soon? There is no such thing as soon when a mental illness has you in its grasp. It’s not like having the flu or a broken leg and over in a short and predictable amount of time. When I think back to when I was at my lowest, I don’t think a card saying ‘Get Well Soon’ would have helped or even made me feel like anyone cared. I think get well card for mental health has to be more humours and personal. To let them know that you will be there if they need you. Maybe it should be a get well card that comes with a small list of tips for the sender to write their personal message inside. There’s something very touching in having someone you care about write down a personal caring message for you. A message that you would read over whenever you felt low, that would make you feel like someone really cared.,As well as there being cards to send those with illness, I think a card to tell loved ones about your illness would be especially helpful. I struggled for a long time to tell my parents and now although they know, we still don’t talk about it openly and I wish we did sometimes. I think if I had told them in a funnier or more noticeable way then maybe we would face my illness a little differently as a family. Maybe with :,‘Just a card to say hello That contains a little confession Lately I’ve been feeling really low And I’m suffering with depression’,Generally I think making that first step a little more personal and with a bit of humour would help the conversation get started. There could also be a link to Time To Change in the card for them to find out more about the conditions and how to talk about them., Katie,I'm a regular visitor to PostSecret.com every Sunday when new secrets are posted. Last weekend there was one that stood out for me. It said 'No one sends you flowers when you are crazy' (attached to this email). I think it was meant to be about Valentine's but my first thought was ""It's true, if you're unwell with a mental health disorder, no-one sends you cards or flowers, especially if you're in hospital"".,I got to thinking more deeply about it. I thought that maybe the reason I didn't get cards or gifts was mainly due to me not telling people what was wrong with me. My hospital stays have been kept hidden from nearly everyone. Then I thought, if someone did send me flowers in hospital, would I actually be allowed to receive them? In some places, they're very strict about what items you can have access to, would they consider flowers to be dangerous?,I have given some people 'hints' about my mental health, for example, saying I'm off work with ""stress"", when actually it's more serious than that. Then I wonder if people don't send Get Well cards is because they think it's not a 'real' illness, or because everyone gets a bit stressed once in a while, so it's not a card-worthy illness.,Even when close friends have found out they've not sent cards. Maybe it's because they wouldn't know what to say in them, or because no such cards exist in card shops. They have general 'Get Well Soon' cards but they often miss the mark, showing pictures of hospitals, bandages or physical illnesses. And it's not the 'done thing', we live in a culture where mental health is still a very taboo subject so sending a card would be an acknowledgement of the subject.,I would love to receive a card when I'm struggling, just to know that my friends care and are there for me. And they don't need to say anything extra in the card than that either. Feeling 'crazy' can make you feel so alone so having someone reach out with a card would really help. And it might be easier for them too, if they don't know what to say to me face-to-face then a card can help with that awkwardness.,A little hint to my friends: Anything with cute animals on the front would work for me, I'm a sucker for puppies, kittens etc.,If you find out someone you know has a mental health problem - you don't need to be an expert to help. Sometimes a conversation can help them know that they are not on their own."
,"Support from family and friends makes all the difference when you experience ,.  For me, illness came quickly, seemingly out of the blue, when I was twenty-six.,I was a newly qualified teacher and experienced acute , followed by a ,.  ,I was taken to hospital and placed under a 72 hour section, spending a month in hospital in total.,I couldn’t have got through the experience without family and friends.  My brother, who was unwell himself, took me home to my parents when he saw I was getting ill.  We shared a very surreal tube journey home during which I told him the people at work were witches and that I needed to be exorcised.  He generously nodded and said, ‘ok Jen’.,My parents took me to the local GP and then to hospital, they were there when I raced, terrified, around the hospital ward, and when I came round some three days later and said to my mum, ‘I think I’ve been acting a bit strangely.’  She sat by my bed and hugged me. ,My boyfriend sat with me holding my hand while my head was spinning with ridiculous notions and ideas.  And my brother came to visit in a wooly hat and scarves to ward off ME and after I’d come round he brought craft materials with him to make a card for his girlfriend.  We didn’t talk about where we were or what had happened, we talked about cutting up photos to make the card.  I helped him a bit with the photos of sky.  Well, maybe ‘helped’ is too generous a word!  But discussed it with him none the less.,Hospital was a strange, unknown place with its own rules and a crowded smoking room.  Having visitors helped me keep my spirits up and believe I was going to go home soon.  It gave me the strength to engage in some of the groups in the hospital, like the yoga class and the art group, and going to those classes helped me find motivation.  ,Friends came to visit bringing postcards for me to put on the wall and one friend brought her Fuzzy Bear to cheer me up and remind me of teenage days listening to the Muppets and Fraggle Rock sound tracks on her Walkman while in our GCSE art exam.,It must have been hard for them to come to a strange concrete building and make a visit they didn’t think they’d have to make. For me it meant the world.  It meant normal life flowing into a place that was not normal at all.  It meant , that helped me build resilience.,I found, when I was experiencing a psychotic episode, that I sensed connections between all things, permeating us all.  Afterwards, it was the connections between my loved ones that meant so much.,I was in hospital on Valentine’s Day and my boyfriend took me to the hospital canteen….  We had a romantic meal of macaroni cheese and I gave him a card I’d made from old bits of material and a picture I’d drawn of a tree of hearts.  I was in a psychiatric ward, but we were continuing with our lives, determined to still share time together.,I will forever be grateful to all my loved ones who showed me such warmth, generosity and friendship through that time, and have continued to through the times to come.,If a loved one of yours has had to go into hospital, please do go and visit them.  Your being there will make all the difference.  Don’t be scared of what to say.  Say anything.  Say nothing.  Ask them how they are.  Talk about a film you’ve seen recently, or your cats, or the fact that your boiler’s on the blink.  It doesn’t matter, just sharing your solidarity at a difficult time: it breathes life into any situation, no matter how hard it seems.  "
,"When you find out you have a , what tends to be the first thing most of us feel? Embarrassment? Shame? Relief that you know what's wrong? Very few people will feel the last emotion, instead first focusing on the shock and embarrassment of the whole situation. A mental health problem?! Does that mean I'm crazy? I know that's how I felt when I was diagnosed with , at a young age, so I kept it to myself.,As I grew up, it became a lot harder to disguise my problems, especially after taking so much time off school. Then, as I started to work, I began to face even more problems. Taking time off school was difficult but manageable but taking time off work meant I was going to get fired. And I did. A lot. There would be days on end I would take off sick but never be able to explain to my bosses what was wrong with me. I was still so embarrassed and ashamed. I'd remain sociable, however, and enjoyed (brief) stints in sales and even behind a bar.,During the middle of last year something hit me. ,: a really strong fear of leaving my home, my comfort zone or going anywhere near a public place. I didn't want to come face to face with anybody and just sat there crying my heart out for what felt like days on end. My partner (Jacob) was extremely confused and was desperate to get me to see a doctor. I was still too ashamed to tell him that I had depression and mental health problems.,I finally gave in and was bundled into a taxi to see my doctor, through a lot of crying and nervous shaking. I told Jacob that I had depression, which worsened when my mother passed away in 2008. I'd tried to cope on my own but it seemed as though everything had finally got on top of me. I was given medication to calm me down and was told that I had agoraphobia, which is a fear of leaving the house, public spaces, any kind of social situation where I could be made to feel uncomfortable. Me? Surely not!,I knew I would never be able to work with this illness, which is why I started working from home on a freelancing website. I wrote blogs, articles, copy and website content for money. However, I wanted to do more. I wanted to stop feeling so ashamed and embarrassed about this problem, this illness, this 'craziness'.,I started putting together , at the end of last year, as well as pictures, artwork and so on. As it is being crowd funded for self publishing it began to pick up attention from the press and I got an e-mail from BBC Radio Kent: 'Would you like to come and talk about your illness on the radio?' ,Could I possibly get to the studio (about 2 minutes walk from my home) and sit talking to thousands of people about my illness? Something I had hidden from as many people as possible for so long? I said I would get back to the producer and spoke to my partner (who I live with) and my dad about it. Their responses were exactly the same: it's time to talk.,On Monday the 14th January I made a very nervy trip to the BBC Radio Kent studio with my Dad there for support. I thought I was going to pass out or be sick on the way but as soon as I met the team there I felt instantly better. Everyone was so supportive and understanding. Just after 10am I spoke for around 20 minutes with Julia George about my struggles, my awareness project and the discrimination in my life.,At 10.30am, on my way home, I felt as though something had been lifted. Perhaps not forever, but for that moment in time I felt normal. I wanted to go and sit in the cafe and have a drink, or pop to the shops on my own. I know it's never going to be that easy but just talking genuinely made me feel better. Especially when I saw the amount of support I had through social networks, my text messages and e-mails from those that had listened.,Now all I can say is that I wish it was time to talk for everyone. The main reason for me putting together the book is to give everybody a chance to talk; to raise awareness and stop this feeling of shame or embarrassment. We're not crazy, we're just like everybody else."
,"About five months ago, my partner and I were struggling with coming to terms with the devastating effect my , had on our relationship.,The first time I approached him about the subject was a few months prior. I told him I was depressed and he said ""no you're not"". End of discussion.,Needless to say, my depression did not simply go away and with time we both realised that something was not right with the way we were dealing with it.,I was telling myself that I did not need professional help but I was in a downward spiral of denial whilst my partner chose to avoid the issue.,He preferred to sweep it under the carpet rather than admit that I was not the same woman he fell in love with.,Finally one day, it all got too much and we could no longer blame our problems on other things. By this point I had received a small lifeline from mental health volunteers who had given me leaflets on depression and ,, which contained information on ,. Determined, I took those leaflets to my partner and asked to talk about the issue.,This was the turning point in my life. From then onwards I opened up to my best friends, and with their help, along with partner's, I realised that I needed to see a doctor and get professional help.,We still struggled, all of us, to come to terms with how our , had changed with the development of my depression. It's an on-going process of communication.,I used to tell my partner that communicating was the only way we were going to get better. I told him how hard it was for me to be in a relationship and he told me how hard it was for him sometimes to hear I was struggling. I told my friends about the battles of everyday life and they told me they would be there for me every step of the way.,Along the way I have lost friends who, instead of reaching out and asking me what was wrong, preferred to remain blind and indifferent about my issues. I was lucky enough to have my base of close friends who were there for me, even when I didn't ask them to be. However, my experience with losing friends left me greatly tainted and worried about how others would react to my illness.,My anxiety took over and led me to avoid many situations where my illness could be exposed. While I realise , is an illness like any other, the negative stigma attached to it means that being a lone voice talking about it amongst those quick to judge is a scary and daunting task. However, I realised that someone else going through my experience with no help whatsoever was even more daunting and scary.,Now that I am better and I have come to terms with my illness, I feel like I need to share my experiences with others to help them come to term with their struggles."
,"I was sat in the staff canteen at work when a colleague, reading an article about a man who had committed ,, turned to me and said “I don’t know how anybody can be so selfish, leaving behind a wife and family.” My heart sunk as I myself have on 2 occasions attempted suicide. I was horrified by his comments and I struggled to hold back the tears. I went back to work wishing I had had the confidence to challenge my colleague’s views.,Whilst I can understand the anguish families must go through when they struggle to come to terms with a relative who has taken their own life, I also think that people need to be more understanding about why someone might take their life.,I suffer from severe clinical , and have feelings of loneliness and isolation. If you feel as though you have nobody to talk to it can be so hard opening up. How do you tell a best friend, mother or father that you wake up every day with thoughts of suicide?,It’s so easy for people to make judgements or assumptions about those who commit suicide.

,"Focussing my mind enough to start writing has already meant that I've deleted and retyped this sentence many times; we're talking double figures here. I will look back at this blog and scoff at myself for the words I have written. My brain likes to do that. But that is me all over. Unfocused dismissive, hesitant but ultimately here.,At the risk of sounding like a lecturer, today's topic is: ,!,So what springs to mind with that word? Commitment, love, soul mate, companion, lust, happiness? How about: Insecurity, self-doubt, pointless arguments, paranoia and self-loathing? Not so much?,Any relationship has its ups and downs. It's normal to bicker or be annoyed by each other and I'm certainly not trying to set myself apart. To put a label on it, I suffer from ,and body dysmorphia. My loving and kind boyfriend is constantly being questioned about who that attractive girl is that's liked his comment on Facebook (and yes, I seem to find myself scrolling through their pictures just to put the paranoia cherry on top of my self-loathing sundae).,He also is used to having his sleeve tugged at if I see a provocative advert I don't want him to look at, or better yet, putting me to bed after having a small meltdown because my brain basically over-heated and caused me to go into hysterics. The embarrassment is still there the day after having a meltdown. He is still learning what I need from him during those moments and we almost have a little feedback exercise the next day to say what worked and what didn't work – from what I can remember anyway.,None of this is particularly romantic but yet I still hold the title of girlfriend. Why? Because I damn well make sure I can give back all the love I get. Deep down I know I am worthy of this man's affections and hell, on a good day when I know my worth, I make sure I tell him! I have no doubt that what I put him through is hard but I also don't doubt that he loves me. I know that if it's getting too much he'll say and that I can openly talk to him about the stupid thoughts that pop into my head because it helps.,Voicing those questions that repeat themselves over and over in your head can take away some of their power; make them seem smaller somehow. If things are getting hard for him, his timing is sometimes awful when he chooses to shows the strain and I will react. But time just calming down and reflecting often sheds some light and realisation on the situation; often from both parties.,I would never say that being in a relationship is a cure for a ,, sometimes it can make it worse. You absolutely have to be ready to put up with annoyances, sacrifices and demands (as well as giving them). Even as I type this my boyfriend is sitting on the edge of the bed waiting for my attention, having just cleared his throat. But please just know that if you want to get in or stay in that relationship and they love you; you are so worth it."
,"Over the months and years I’ve suffered from , and ,, I found I was only able to talk to a few people. The few friends who I revealed information to were supportive but didn’t really understand so I didn’t tell them as much. ,I really appreciated their kindness but just couldn’t be completely myself. However the ones who I felt safe with and who I was able to talk to about everything were my family and three teachers. ,They just gave me time, a smile, a thoughtful comment, a joke, a distraction. Without these people I wouldn’t have got through the first time I had , and now I have fallen back into that mind-set, I wouldn’t be so determined to beat it again if it wasn’t for their selfless support and guidance.,There’s one comment which stands out for me and which I’ll never forget… In Sixth Form, after failing a piece of coursework, my teacher (who knew I liked football) whispered to me that “footballers don’t score goals when they are injured”. This personalised comment meant so much to me and helped to relieve the anger and frustration that I felt because I wasn’t doing well at school at that time.,It’s so important that people have someone they can talk to. It doesn’t even have to be about mental health. You could discuss X Factor, football, a good book;whatever it is, the fact someone has taken the time to talk to you means so much., I’ve written this poem to express how I feel at the moment about but also because it is time to change. I would like to dedicate it to everyone who has helped me but also to everyone who is living with a mental health problem and the special people supporting them.,Why am I ashamed? I’ve got nothing to hide.,Why is it a secret? It’s just a different side.,This constant feeling of numbness, is hindering my life,,The sharp pains in my chest, cutting like a knife.,The questions and frustration, the never ending tears,,The sense of being lost, just emphasizing my fears.,Staring at the ceiling, the time just passes by,,Why oh why won’t my body, respond to anything I try?,I admit I’ve got depression, that and anxiety too,,But really if you look, I’m still the same as you.,Don’t think of me as different, just smile and be kind,,I’m still who I was, just trapped inside my mind.,Why should mental health, be a whispered conversation?,The time has come at last, to discuss it as a nation.,Together we’ll break down, the stigma and misconception,Together we’ll show pride, for having beaten depression."
,"Some people will scoff when I say I've been spurred on to write my thoughts out as candidly as I'm about to by a song in the charts. Listening to the radio a song really jumped out at me recently by Kelly Clarkson entitled 'Dark Side',,""Everybody's got a dark side. ,
Do you love me?,
Can you love mine?,
Nobody's a picture perfect,,
but we're worth it,,
you know that we're worth it.,
Will you love me?,
Even with my dark side?"",I'm a very musical person and I absolutely love nothing more than really listening to the lyrics and searching for my own meanings. Music has the power to lift my mood completely or offer me a comfort blanket during some of my less than good times. And this song really spoke to me and was the 'light bulb moment' for me to sit down and write what I'm about to.,I struggle with depression.,That's a pretty big thing for me to write because for so long I have battled against an internal monologue in my head convincing me that I couldn't possibly be ,, that I was just having a bad day/week/month and I'd get over it eventually. ,I feared that if I mentioned the word 'depression' to anyone I'd be met with prejudice and laughter. I've got away with that because for the most part my moods are cyclical. I can go a few months getting on with life like I'm supposed to and then suddenly I'll crash head first into this brick wall and the darkness will descend, making it almost impossible for me to function 'normally.',I have one of the best support-networks anyone could ask for but none of them know the true extent of my struggle because I'm terrified to even admit to myself that there's a problem. If I can't do that then there is no way I'm going to open up to my loved ones. I'm scared that if this gets out into the open then I'll somehow destroy the harmony of everyone's worlds, in particular my husband and mine. ,Our , isn't perfect, it takes work, but then I think every relationship is a constant series of ups and downs. And I think the biggest problem is my , struggles. It’s a black cloud over our joint happiness and it's always going to follow us if I don't do something about it.,My husband is my absolute rock, I love him with every fibre of my being and it destroys me to watch myself pick away at the bonds that tie us together because I'm so unhappy in my own head. I'm scared to say anything I'm thinking about because I don't want things to be any different between us and having mental problems brings a third angle to our relationship that I don't want. I want to just get on with life being together like a normal couple and doing things together like we used to. ,I'm absolutely terrified of going to get any proper help in case I'm told I'm making all of this up and I need to just get a grip. I know that most likely won't happen with medical professionals but there is definitely still a stigma attached to the word 'depression' that is scaring me out of doing anything about my problems. It’s classed by so many people as something made up to get you out of being a normal human being like everyone else. And I'm scared that if I'm given a actual medical diagnosis this will make it all the more real and it’s not just that I'm having a bad day/week/month... it’s something that needs real treatment.,I feel like I shouldn't even be contemplating this because, on paper, I lead a truly amazing life. I have a husband who loves me, we have a lovely home and a cat and friends who we spend time with and loving families who would do anything for us... that doesn't sound like the life of someone who is massively unhappy does it? ,The quote “a problem shared is a problem halved” is so apt in situations like this and I'm promising myself that from here on in I will start to talk about my mental health problems frankly and honestly.

,"Some , are relatively well known even if they are not well understood. I have ,, nobody seems to have heard of it and I call the discrimination I get from it the 'Fear of the Unknown'. , I've yet to see any personal , about BPD because no one seems to know what it is! Discrimination is a different story though. From friends, employers and strangers in the street, everyone has an opinion and loves to tell you theirs. The most common comments I get are:,And the one I hate the most:,Would these people tell someone with an amputated leg to just 'Get a grip'? Would they tell a blind person to 'Stop looking for attention'? Probably not.,I've suffered discrimination on a regular basis. After my diagnosis I lost a lot of friends, especially on Facebook. Every day the numbers dropped. In the end I closed down my account. I have to say it’s one of the best things I ever did. No more worries about 'is that status about me?' or that sick feeling every time someone calls someone else 'mental'. I have less real friends now but the ones I still have are genuine and understanding. Quality 1 - Quantity 0.,I had the same job for nearly a decade; behind a bar, working my way up to manager. I'd unknowingly suffered from BPD for the whole time but was only diagnosed in January 2012. Then everything changed. In December 2011 the company told me they would need to cut down staff numbers. My job was safe but they needed my input on who to keep and who to lose. This was a lengthy process and all along I was told that I was proving my value to the company.,After my diagnosis a month later I informed my employer that I had BPD, honesty is the best policy, right? A week later, I was made redundant. Seems my value had plummeted.,Now I needed to apply for another job. Application forms ask the dreaded question 'Have you ever suffered Mental Health problems?'. Lie or tell the truth? I'm sure I'm not the first person who has thought putting yes meant I may as well just throw the application in the bin and forget about it.,The most heartbreaking experience of discrimination, for me, happened one afternoon at my local ,. I'd received a letter from my local council that made no sense. After having dealt with the council on many occasions and explaining to deaf ears that I have BPD so to be patient with me, I decided to let the CAB deal with it for me. ,They rang the council who denied ever sending the letter. I never expected what was said next: ' you do know the person you’re calling on behalf of is a bit mental and is probably imagining the letter'. Complete heartbreak and a massive step back for my efforts to manage with my illness. Safe to say the nice chap at the CAB made sure that the situation was rectified and even made a complaint on my behalf to the Local Government Ombudsman.,So that covers some of the negativity and now for the positivity.,Its time to talk. I did and my life has changed. After over a decade of antidepressants, diagnoses of mild , and counselling sessions that showed no real results I'd reached breaking point. I broke down on my dad's shoulder and told him everything: how I was feeling, the effect it was having on my life and , and how I was struggling to even get out of bed most days. My father, my hero. ,He stayed with me for a few days, took me down to my GP and told him enough was enough. What they'd tried over and over again wasn't working and it was time to get to the bottom of it. He stood my corner and it worked. I was referred to a psychiatrist who eventually diagnosed me with BPD.,I'm now getting the , I need and I have a better understanding of what makes me tick. I still struggle but I know I'm on the right track because I realised it was time to talk. Here's hoping others do too.,I live my life by this simple phrase - everyone has baggage. In life the only people to listen to are the ones willing to help carry the load."
,"I might get a slapped wrist for opening like this, but helping someone with , issues can be a tricky blighter at times.  No matter how much you care about somebody, it's really hard not to get anything back when you're putting so much hard work in. , It's like when somebody has a great idea on Dragon's Den, they put their heart and soul in to their pitch, ask for very little from the Dragons but they sit there stoney faced, refusing to even meet them halfway.  ,I've been on both sides of that metaphorical Den of mythical reptiles and all I'd like to say is - please keep trying.  We need you.  I have a tendency to drown people in metaphor but what it boils down to is, the tiniest things do make a difference, even if you can't see it. ,I've recorded a little video blog to try and explain what I mean. And so that you can laugh at my bowler hat."
,"There has been a reasonable amount of dark in my experience of , and ,. I don’t think any amount of understanding or insight can prepare you for how it really feels to have depression. ,For me, at times, there was such darkness that I couldn’t believe anything would be good again. However, having gone through the recovery process, there has been one positive from it all, which is something I definitely didn’t expect.,I went through the lead up to diagnosis with my family, who have always been incredibly supportive so I was really lucky to have them there for me. Once diagnosed, I also decided to tell close friends, as they had known I was struggling, so I felt they would understand.  I am lucky in that no-one has reacted in a negative way to me telling them or talking about my ,.,I think that is also because I chose carefully who to talk to. In fact, the more people I shared it with, the more I started to hear from friends and family who had experienced something similar and who I was able to share my thoughts and feelings with. I massively value the support I have from everyone, but there is nothing that quite compares to talking to people who have been there and felt the same or similar emotions, had the same thoughts as you have. Only this week I received a message from a friend who had suffered from anxiety and ,, offering support and a chat any time, as a result of me sharing , on Facebook.,Not everyone has the same experience of course. A friend of mine had also been diagnosed with depression around the same time as I was, for completely different reasons, and instead of finding it supportive, I almost felt more isolated as I felt there was little about their experience that I could identify with. So of course each of our journeys is our own, but now I find it incredibly reassuring to know there are certain people I can go to, when the general support from friends isn’t quite enough.,I have noticed a difference between support from people who have had depression/anxiety and those who haven’t. It isn’t that I value their support any less, but I know before I had depression I didn’t really know what it’s like to have it, and also to live with it 24/7. At times when I feel they don’t understand, I have to remind myself that it isn’t for a lack of trying and that their intention is still to help, even if that is not the result for me. ,With those who have experienced something similar, I think knowing that they have shared those darkest feelings or a similar struggle, brings you closer on some level, that there is an understanding you don’t have to articulate with words. That is the light for me which came from the darker parts of depression.,That is also why I think talking about mental health is so important. Of course, you don’t always have the energy for it. I am surprised to find myself wanting to write about it, I would never have considered it a few months ago. But now it is quite therapeutic and I hope other people can recognise something in this and find some hope from my experience. I never expected there to be a positive from such a difficult thing as depression but it is true that you never know what can arise from any situation. ,I think there is still an underlying , and I really like the ethos behind Time to Change as I hope this will highlight the true experience of having a mental health condition, and dispel some of the myths around it. From my experience I would say sharing your thoughts and feelings with the right person can have great benefits which will long outlive the negative experiences I had at the worst point of my depression."
,"Last year when I had been under stress due to university work and my job coming to an end, I became so socially isolated and depressed and, something that anyone who has a lived experience of , would understand, lost in the moment of the darkness of depression. ,I cannot impress how unwell I had become. Moreover, at that time in my life I was unable to see the fact that I was clinically depressed.  It had got to the point where I did not want to live another day and I had become overwhelmed by the darkness I call my depression. I did not actively want to end my life as I would have needed to have the get-up-and-go that was needed to do anything that involved moving, thinking or processing. ,I have, over the years, named my depression  “the darkness” as this is the only way I can explain these times as darkness -  a world without colour and great sense of pain. ,I would say my life is like a coin.  On one side of the coin there is a darkness that is what I now know as depression and on the other said there is lightness which is what I call mania.  My life, living with ,, is like the coin spinning and spinning.  Sometimes the coin lands on the depressed side and other time on the manic side. However, more often  than not, the coin is just spinning and I am waiting to see where the coin will land and the mental anguish of the waiting game is played out day-to-day.,However, sometimes the coin of mental ill health may be shuffled by life events and circumstances eg the loss of my job and university.  I remember I had not been out or spoken to anyone for days and I didn’t even have the insight to think about opening the blinds in my bedroom.  I had become socially isolated, lost within the comfort of my bedroom.  My loved ones had planned to take me to hospital and it was close to happening. However two very dear friends took a different approach.,This approach was just to sit in the same room as me and watch TV. The next day my friend came with a picnic and we had a bed picnic and on day three a long chat about how I was feeling. I remember both of my friends did this independently of each other. I later asked them why they did what they did.,Although this was something that I did not process at the time, this was positive as both my friends had been able to offer what I needed and, by day six I was sitting within my small garden with my friends.,I believe the key to this success was that they asked basic questions “ Isaac, what do you want?” and  “is there anything you don’t want me to do?” Moreover them just being able to sit with me during the times when words were not expressed or when I didn’t feel like talking. I know this is a skill that not many people have.  More often than not silence can be very difficult place for people to visit.   When looking back on those dark feelings that I could not process and that I didn’t have the energy to deal with, having two good friends who were able to talk to me about my needs and wants was the key to me being able to put one foot forward and then the next."
,"My mum and dad were diagnosed with , and ,, respectively, in their early twenties, spending time in and out of psychiatric wards, which is where they met. ,After they had had their second child, my younger sister, they were deemed ‘unsuitable and incapable’ of looking after two children under two-years-old by the courts and we were sent to live with our grandparents. As we grew up my sister and I were asked continuously by social workers to repeat to them the reason for our living in care: we had to explain that our parents had mental illnesses and as such could not look after us.,We saw our parents regularly, sometimes staying weekends, depending on their adherence to medication and their state of mind. We grew up believing it is scary to have ‘mental illnesses’, with no-one explaining (perhaps because they were not educated enough to) as to why dad sat talking to himself and why mum thought aliens were coming to take her to a better place. ,I had , myself in 2000. I know my abilities. I am both strong and insecure at the same time, but so too are other people un-diagnosed with mental health issues. I am not ill, I am capable, I am different: I am me and I am happy with that, depression and all.,My family’s history of , issues have had a strong influence on my own life and the decisions I have made. I have seen the surrounding , my parents have suffered as a result of been diagnosed mentally ill. My childhood confrontation with mental health stigma prompted me to learn why these mental differences exist and to what end.,Studying psychology and undertaking my own research, I have embarked on a campaign to re-consider the term mental health and have adopted the little-known term ‘neuro-diversity’. It is my hope that this will replace the negative connotations of mental illness and mental health, which both imply disorder and having something wrong with you. Upon starting my first year at university, the organisation Time to Change (who themselves campaign to end the stigma surrounding the neurologically diverse) appealed to universities, asking students to get more involved.,After considering smaller scale and lower-impacting ventures, I began a project to put on a play concerning the positive aspects of neuro-diversity. The idea was to look at the other side of mental illness, as there are plenty of plays, films, documentaries, books etc. depicting the stereotypical negative aspects of being mentally “different”. When each performance finishes the audience will be invited to have their say on the themes portrayed and to re-consider their own beliefs about the 1-in-4 people who will experience mental illness. ,I want to put an end to defining a person exclusively according to their mental health.  Neuro-diversity has produced some of the greatest minds of humanity: Dickens, Tolstoy, and Hemingway, to name a few. We should not continue to discriminate against neuro-diverse individuals.,Stigmaphrenia is showing on the 1st and 2nd of Feb 2013 at 8pm (doors open at 7.40pm)

,"As a teacher of Creative Writing I am always telling my learners that they need to use their life experience as a well to draw on for their writing. Some of the exercises I give them to do involve tapping into their memories and using their senses as a guide, including their remembered feelings.,I am aware that this can be highly emotional for some people, especially if the task involves remembering a certain age or time in life. I always encourage them to not waste their emotions and experiences and whenever they have a bad time or a difficult episode to record it. As an example I often tell them that I have had some ‘issues’ with , and , during the past few years after my father died at a coincidence of crises in my life and that to capture the feelings in a written record has been cathartic for me and potentially valuable in my writing.,It is amazing how many times people respond to my frankness by telling, sometimes in open class, about their own experiences. And even those who have not had such problems tend to join in with different kinds of experiences of their own. I am a very up-beat, positive character as a teacher and we have a lot of laughs and a great deal of fun and I am sure it comes as a surprise to many people that I have had , issues.,There are always those in the class, of course, who are unable to relate personally to these revelations but I have always found it a positive and helpful experience to be open in this way and have felt higher levels of association with my learners as a result.,Sharing personal experiences like this with a group of people that you don’t know too well can be a bit scary but when I do so I am reminded that I am far from alone in this, even though it can sometimes feel like it. We don’t usually dwell on our problems in the group, after all, it’s Creative Writing and not mutual self-help, but I am always pleased that I felt able to make one more step in dispelling the stigma attached to mental health issues and that others may now also feel able to do so too."
,"When I started at my current job, around three years ago, I disclosed my , history because I didn’t want it to sneak up and bite me in the backside like it has in the past.,There seemed to be no issues with it at all and for the first year everything went smoothly. Then some of my old problems crept up (aided by some particularly stressful situations at work) and I ended taking time off here and there. However, I was my own worst enemy: those days when I couldn’t face even getting out of bed I called in with “flu” or a “virus”, not admitting my real problems.,After all, how do you tell your manager that you can’t work today because you’re ,? How do you explain to someone, who isn’t sympathetic at the best of times, that there’s an emotional force field keeping you inside your house?,After around two years of random absences I’m on my final warning. At my last Sickness Absence Review I explained that I’m currently having a lot of problems and am receiving help from the local mental health team but these were brushed aside because none of the reasons for my days off were down to “mental health”.,I am now struggling to make it into work on a daily basis but I just can’t call in sick. If I’d just been honest then maybe management would be more lenient?,Lying about things definitely makes it worse. It drills a hole that gets bigger and bigger and just can’t be covered up by more lies. I still don’t fully understand why I lied in the first place. I guess the embarrassment and shame of admitting that I couldn’t cope was a big reason but I think my biggest fear was the reaction of the bosses at work.,I had no idea what they’d say or do in my circumstances. I know for certain that the return-to-work forms we use after absences aren’t created with mental illness in mind; you need to be able to put something physical on them. The only part that might seem relevant is the tick box that asks if you’re stressed! It’s like they acknowledge that ,is an actual condition but they don’t want to address it in any way. Unless it’s work-related, in which case they’ll suggest the job isn’t for you anymore."
,"I find myself on a three-hour train journey, not at all in a good frame of mind: too much time to think. Ordinarily, as an aspiring writer, I love to think, to create, to have ideas that amuse and entertain me and could one day entertain and amuse other people. But on this particular trip, three hours alone with my brain is something I need like petrol needs a naked flame.,You see, I suffer from ,. Suffer in that I do not enjoy it. For as long as I can remember a part of my mind has repeatedly told me that everything bad anyone has ever said about me is right: the kids who taunted me for being too smart, too skinny and then too fat, the teachers and bosses for whom I was never good enough, the girls who rejected me. They can’t all be wrong, it tells me. Despite George Orwell’s protestations to the contrary, being in a minority of one does actually make you mad.,I have rarely talked about my illness,I have rarely talked about my illness, simply because nobody seems to understand it. Talk to anyone about a , and they immediately lump you in with the horror stories from the 1990s of murdering paranoid schizophrenics on the British streets. You have to disclose illness on job applications and will inevitably fail the medical as a result because nobody wants to employ ‘a mental’ who might shoot up the office because they ran out of tea bags. So I keep it to myself and only disclosed it to my employers when depression began to affect my work.,And so to the train. The night before I’d sat through (500 Days of) Summer, a torturous exercise but as my girlfriend had never seen it I decided to go along with it. Much as I relished two hours looking at Zooey Deschanel, the film had a very peculiar effect on me. The film tells the story of a poor schmoe who meets an amazing free-spirited girl called Summer and tells the 500 days from their first meeting ’til the last time he ever sees her. It is not your conventional love story but the whole thing made me think about an ex-girlfriend who, like the title character, could never reciprocate my feelings for her. And my mind being what it is, it continued to dwell for the next 24 hours. Having three hours to stew just made things worse.,I convinced myself that my current relationship would fail,During the course of the journey I convinced myself that my current , would fail because every other one had; that I would say or do the wrong thing and end up alone until the day I die. And then the other doubts came swimming up. I was a cowardly talentless idiot who could never fulfil my dreams because I didn’t have the guts or talent to become a writer. I would never be happy in anything as a result and would spend the rest of my life unhappy, unfulfilled and utterly, utterly alone.,Every song on my MP3 player got skipped until sad ones came on: Black by Pearl Jam was on repeat for about 30 minutes. It contains the lines I know someday you’ll have a beautiful life, I know you’ll be a star in somebody else’s sky, But why, why, why can’t it be, can’t it be mine?, which brought me back to the end of things with my previous girlfriend. I was so totally convinced that I was destined to be unhappy for the rest of my life that I had finally decided to end it. I had a plan from previous breakdowns and knew what I would do. I left a message on Facebook apologising to everyone I knew for everything I’d ever done wrong to them just as my phone battery died.,my sister phoned in floods of tears,By the time I made it home I’d stabilised somewhat but still knew that over the next few days I would be ending my life. I’d been in the flat for only a few minutes when my sister phoned in floods of tears, demanding to know what the hell was going on. Part of me felt that she still didn’t care, that she thought I was nothing but a hypochondriac and that I didn’t have depression since I could actually get out of bed on a morning.,It didn’t matter that the only thing that got me out of bed was that, living alone, nobody else would pay my rent or do my laundry for me. And besides, she’d be better off without me. They all would, all I was doing was burdening my family and friends with my stupid, erratic behaviour and pathetic self-indulgence.,He claimed he understood and... was insistent that I go to the hospital,This particular train of self-indulgent thought was interrupted by a loud hammering on the door: unable to get hold of me, my sister had phoned the police. Teary-eyed and wallowing in self-loathing and shame, I answered to a copper who I swear was younger than me. He claimed he understood and, despite my pleadings that my sister had overreacted, was insistent that I go to the hospital to be checked out. The biggest shock, and one that chilled me to my very core, was when he said he had powers to make me go if I didn’t co-operate.,The fear of being committed is very much alive in me. I live in permanent fear of being locked up for my own and everyone else’s good. It happened to a friend from uni who had depression and ended up in a secure hospital unit for nearly a year. The thought of being trapped in a padded cell indefinitely terrified me on a level I can’t even begin to describe. Interrupted by phone calls from my dad, best friend, workmate and girlfriend, I ended up sat in the back of an ambulance in a sort of haze, none of what was happening to me seeming to be particularly real.,I left to find four of my closest friends waiting for me in the waiting room,After several dazed conversations with the triage nurses I was led in to see an out-of-hours GP who I basically spilled my guts to: the film, the end of my last relationship, the time spent alone, the plan for suicide, the history of self-harm. Everything. He realised that the shock of the evening’s events had brought me out of my suicidal mood and referred the notes on to my own GP, on the proviso I get an urgent appointment the following day. I left to find four of my closest friends waiting for me in the waiting room. Not judging me, not condemning me, just there. Suddenly I no longer felt quite so alone.,Since this last episode people are more understanding.

,"2012 has been a tough year, brutal at times, but I know it's one I'll look back on with great fondness in the future. After years of struggling with mental illness, in March I had the breakdown which led to me gaining access to the requisite psychiatric services. I was diagnosed as having , and started to get the help I needed.,It was also a watershed year for another reason- after years of keeping quiet about my illness through feelings of shame, I decided to open up to people. After reading, and being touched by people’s stories on the Time to Change website, I wrote ,, and also 'came out' to family and friends and on Facebook. It was nerve-wracking at first - one of the hardest things I've ever done - but the amazing love and support I received was overwhelming and very humbling. It made me wish I'd done it years before.,The cornerstone of my support network is my friend Matt. He's always been there in the toughest times, after my breakdowns and suicide attempts. This year he really went into bat for me. He was ever-present on the end of the phone - a call or a text always seemed to come at the right time, when I needed it most. Endless games of online chess proved a distraction for my mind, whilst a stream of rubbish jokes never failed to make me smile. The rock-solid support he has given me has definitely brought us closer together, and I appreciate how lucky I am to have a friend like him.,In May he invited me down to Bedford, to stay with him and his partner Rachel for a few days. I booked a train ticket and packed a bag, but as the day approached I started to panic about the journey. I nearly cancelled several times, but I didn't want to let Matt down - another person to add to the list. I also knew deep down that the trip would do me good. It took every fibre of my being to get on the train, but I did, and as Matt met me at Bedford station with a hug and a smile, I knew I'd done the right thing.,We spent several days laying a patio in his garden, playing golf (he maintains he let me win to help my depression!), drinking beer and talking about stuff. I didn't realise at the time, but looking back I can pinpoint the start of my recovery to those few days. I think I knew, heading back on the train, that things would eventually be ok.,So when I was approached by Time to Change to participate in an article for Rugby World magazine about sport, , and support networks I was happy to help. I feel very privileged and proud to help in any way I can.,I was interviewed for the piece by the magazine's editor, Owain Jones. I was initially nervous, talking to a complete stranger, but he really put me at ease. We ended up chatting for ages, and I enjoyed the process. As well as Matt and myself, the article centres on Duncan Bell and David Flatman, both former Bath and England front-row players. Duncan was very brave in April last year in going public about his ten years of struggling with ,. He's now head coach at Lydney, and getting on well.,By a strange quirk of coincidence I was at Matt and Rachel's wedding a couple of weeks after doing the interview, and David Flatman was also a guest (he's the bride's godfather.) We got introduced, and chatted for half an hour about our experiences of doing the Rugby World piece and mental illness in general.,He asked how I was doing, and told me how he was helping Duncan. It was great to talk to him, and it genuinely felt like having a normal conversation with a mate - plenty of banter, no shame or stigma on my part or awkwardness on his. It was only the next day, whilst thinking about it, that I realised the significance of it. Just a year before, I never would have been able to have a conversation like that with anyone, let alone a stranger. So for me, talking about mental illness has only been a positive thing.,That conversation felt like a glimpse of what the future will be like, when the Time to Change campaign has been as successful as I imagine it's going to be. Just the way my life has changed since I first came across this website makes me feel optimistic that , will end. So thank you for giving me the opportunity to be involved in some small way."",The February issue of , looks at depression and mental health in the world of sport through an interview with Duncan Bell."
,"I am excellent at pretending. Pretending I am interested in whatever the current topic of conversation may be; when, in fact, I am entirely, momentarily (hopefully), hollowed out, numb, incapable of communication on anything other than a basic level: ""Yes. No. Okay""; when all I want is the conversation to end, as soon as possible, as painlessly as possible, but for it to do so would involve me being able to talk, to explain - a dark irony not lost on me as I stare at the tabletop.,I am excellent at pretending. Pretending I'm happily joining in, laughing along, when, in fact, I am grossly irritated and impatient, overwhelmed by the noise in the restaurant, ready to explode at the slightest imagined slight. I am unpredictable. It's our first date and I'm wondering if she has noticed these things. Should I tell her that often I'm not myself. It doesn't define me but I worry she'll think I'm making excuses for myself, so I sit there, silently, stupidly collapsing before this beautiful girl.,I am understanding. A , with the effects that , has will force perspective on a person. I have a first-hand understanding of human vagaries, how we are all beholden to our moods, I have to. I have to. The illness has taught me to not judge, to consider the root cause of peoples actions (tip: it's rarely personal). ,I have learnt, the hard way, that to be forgiving of others indiscretions, their aggressions, is a hugely worthwhile discipline. I am a fighter. After each break down, or set-back, I recrystallise, and attempt to rebuild , with family, lovers and friends, forge ahead with my work. I'll never give up and for this I am proud of myself (it's important to focus on such things when you have a guilt-sheet as long as your arm).,I'm thinking these things, watching her eat dessert, pretty elegantly actually, I observe. And then I'm recognising the fact that making an observation like this is usually a sign that the depression is lifting a little, that my brain is preparing to get out of bed. This glimmer of hope leads me to consider the things I've been telling you about, and which bits, if any, to tell her about , when she quietly says:,""Are you okay? You don't like me, do you?"",I want to tell her how being , numbs me to a degree that I am incapable of liking or disliking things  on the level I think she's talking about. Or maybe I'll quote Kay Redfield Jamison speech at her:,""[people] imply that they know what it is like to be depressed because they have gone through a divorce, lost a job, or broken up with someone. But these experiences carry with them feelings. Depression, instead, is flat, hollow, and unendurable. It is also tiresome. People cannot abide being around you when you are depressed. They might think that they ought to, and they might even try, but you know and they know that you are tedious beyond belief"",And hope that by simply illustrating the differences between one of the side-effects of my illness and something she has presumably experienced she'll get a better idea of  why I am so monosyllabic tonight. ,I'm not always this way, I so desperately want to tell her. I want to tell her that my brain often fizzes like the drink she's sipping, that the world vibrates with infinite possibilities, endless beauty, a thousand profound connections a second. Much of this can contribute to my mania but, just like the negative stuff, some of it is me, too. I want to tell her how I don't feel pity for myself, quite the opposite, I am often proud. Mostly, I just want to tell her.,So, emboldened by the sight of great food and her smile, shamed by bringing her out to look after a seemingly sulky child, then, buoyed by a momentary, magical lifting of the numbness (as predicted earlier when watching her daintily nibble cake), I carefully explain some of these things I've talked to you about. And, of course, she reacts with loveliness and grace. She tells me she thought something was up, and tried not to take it personally, and how she understands, she really does. ,I am relieved but cautious as most people I let into my life say they can ""deal with it"" until they have to deal with it but, as we step out onto the street, and she grabs a single finger, I remember that the worst that can happen is that I will learn a little about this person, and so, on some level, about all people.  Let me tell you, that is more than enough."
,"In 1996, when I was 24, I was doing pretty well after a number surgeries since I was young, and battling , since I was 14.,Following that period, by my early 20's I was finally enjoying more of a social life, and I was going to college, but was then involved in an incident with a taxi driver, which although it wasn’t violent, left me very shaken up. I tried to report the incident and was told over the phone by the police to put it down to personal experience and not use them again.,A while after, I was at college and I was on work experience in London, and one day I was stopped and searched by two police officers. They didn’t give me a reason and I wasn’t sure what was going on, in fact I didn’t even notice the police car pull up behind me.,One of them kept talking to me while the other asked me to empty my pockets and searched my wallet. They searched me thoroughly in the street and I still wasn’t given a reason for their actions. I asked them for their names and they wrote them down.,I began having violent delusions,Somewhere in between that and receiving an apology for the stop and search (which was resolved informally) I began having violent delusions where I was stopped and searched, arrested, and beaten up in a police cell. I was awake while I was having these delusions, and it was always an exaggerated form of the stop and search, so they would start with being stopped and searched, I would normally be trying to explain what I was doing, and they wouldn’t believe me. Then I would be taken to a police station.,The delusions got increasingly violent, I would be punched, kicked in the face and beaten by 1 or 2 officers, and then if I tried to ask for help nobody would be interested. The delusions got really intense and lasted for around four or five months. I went to my doctor, and tried to explain what was happening. I had no words to describe them so I called them 'nightmares'. He gave me sleeping tablets.,Gradually my life got back on track,Gradually my life got back on track, I went to a new college, went to therapy and did pretty well. I was well for 12 years, and in that time was in therapy for three years and met a couple of people who helped.,In May 2010 I went to a local IDAHO event and met some of the Surrey Police Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual & Transgender Liaison Officers (LAGLOS). I asked if they do anything about ,. I was quite scared because I didn’t want to explain it in detail. I was able to meet and talk about my experiences which helped. In the meantime I was still suicidal and trying to get help. I was assessed in July 2010 and was told that I was at a ‘low to moderate risk’. I obviously didn’t agree.,Later that year I was asked if I wanted to join the local police IAG (Independent Advisory Group). A number of people applied and after my interview I was then formally asked to join.,I've learnt a lot about how the police work,I've learnt a lot about how the police work and some things which I thought would be triggers haven't been. I still have issues but I also have real experiences to put in place of the thoughts I've had in the past, which so far has helped quite a lot.,When I gave a talk to the group of LAGLOs they were very interested and seemed willing to learn and certainly asked a lot of interesting questions. I felt that they wanted to understand my experience of the mental health service as well and the idea that even if someone is asking for help the don’t always get it. I think perhaps the more usual issue is the police trying to help someone who doesn’t think they need help.,I was also able to show them a couple of my films too,I was also able to show them a couple of my films too, which, although not about mental illness, I think did challenge their views.,With the IAG itself, although I’ve been a member for nearly a year now, there hasn’t been that much to do with mental health, so it may take a while before I really need to challenge anyone’s views (meetings are once every 2 months).,I know if I feel unable to say something in the public meeting I can contact speakers by email, so it certainly feels accessible. In the long run it’s been a good experience so far, and I hope it continues."
,"I am 28 years old and have been living with , with Psychosis since I was 14 years old. However I was only diagnosed August 2011 after a suicide attempt.,When I was working as an art teacher, everything had got way too much. I was having severe migraines, pains in my chest, pins and needles in the back of my head and feeling faint. I wasn’t diagnosed at this point but my doctor was aware that something was wrong. I was signed off with work related stress and ,.,During my time off I was mainly sitting and starring, not washing, not bothering to eat and sleeping a lot. I felt like it was all pointless...I would often think to myself... “I am not really needed at work, if I wasn't there someone else would teach the kids and they would probably be better than me anyway!”,I remember one situation that really upset me. I hadn’t been out in weeks and it was St Patrick’s Day. My family is Irish and I normally always have a little half pint of Guinness in memory of my granddad who died when I was 9 years old. My husband said to me, “You are gonna get dressed and we are going to go to the pub and have a drink for your granddad - it will do you good to get out.” I did as I was told hoping it might make me better to get out of the flat but when we got there the pub was full of my teacher friends. I said “hello”. I looked a state! My hair was tied back because it was greasy and unwashed - I’d thrown on some clothes that looked like PJ's. One of the teachers who was covering my classes at the time gave me an evil stare and barged me - hurting me as she walked past me.,It was at this moment it dawned on me how everyone felt about my absence. I was a problem in their eyes, someone who didn’t want to work and was having the time of her life.,Once the , passed I seemed to go through a spell of not really sleeping at all. I sat up and read a book until 5am. I would clean the flat at odd hours in the morning and sometimes go walking down the street after midnight just because it seemed like a good idea. I and most of my teacher friends are on Facebook, I had updated my status to say I was very excited about the book I was reading (I did not know at the time I was actually hyper manic). A friend had told me that this status had created quite a stir because, as I was off sick, I was not allowed to be happy!,After this I became very depressed, reality hit and I was now reviewing the impulsive decisions I had made. People often referred to me as a wild child, scatty, who had a lot of fads... if they could see me at my lowest they probably wouldn’t recognise me. Socially I wear a mask, I wear a smile but it's lies."
,"I was recently touched deeply by two TED talks by Brene Brown, ‘,’ and the second is ‘,.’,The two quotes which sum up these talk beautifully are:,‘Vulnerability is our most accurate measurement of courage.',‘Vulnerability is not weakness. And that myth is profoundly dangerous.’,Before I stumbled across these talks during my frequent wanderings on , I opened up to someone in a way that I hadn't done in a long while. I talked about why a friend’s death had affected me so much. My friend’s death, more specifically suicide, was a tragic event to say the least. He was an amazing young man who had such a big heart and would always listen and help you no matter what time of the day or night you sought his help.,When a friend informed me of his death it took me back in such a way that I was metaphorically knocked off my feet. Why? Because the previous year I had considered doing the same. I have struggled with my sexuality, religion and culture for as long as I can remember and I reached a point in my life where I thought it would be better to end my own life rather than to continue living in that misery.,a friend pointed out that it sounded like I was going through depression,It wasn't until years later that a friend pointed out that it sounded like I was going through ,. In hindsight, I think she was right and it scared me to admit that. I can’t help but feel some shame attached to that vulnerability, especially considering that suicide is against Islam. The thing that upset me the most about my friend’s suicide was the fact that he had helped me so much. Actually that’s a massive understatement; he was one of the people who saved my life. He wholeheartedly believed that coming out to my mum would be okay and that she would still love me. Friends had tried to comfort me with similar words before but I knew that deep down they didn't really believe it. When Peter said it, it was genuine and honest and I took great comfort in this and ultimately he was right.,My guilt lies in the fact that Peter was one of the people who saved my life and yet I was unable to save his. If only I had told him how much of a profound impact he had on my life than perhaps he would have reconsidered his decision? I know that rationally this argument doesn't make much sense and that it is a waste of time and energy in thinking ‘what ifs’ and ‘if only’ but I just can’t help it. This is something that hopefully I will come to terms with. In any case, it has allowed me realise even more so just how much our actions or even inaction can affect other people. Simple and indeed random acts of kindness are sometimes more than enough to make anyone’s day and quite literally change their lives.,he biggest comfort when talking about vulnerability and shame was when my friend replied ‘me too’,I felt vulnerable in telling someone how I really felt. I had shame in the fact that, as a queer Black feminist Muslim, I still, even now, find it difficult to be who I am in my culture and religion. Even though I have reconciled them now I have the added difficulty of trying to deal with my , issues in a more productive way. The biggest comfort when talking about vulnerability and shame was when my friend replied ‘me too’.,Knowing that other people are going through a similar situation is incredibly comforting because when they listen and offer you advice you know they are truly able to understand and empathise with how you feel. The vulnerability that I felt when talking to my friend about these two issues was difficult to say the least but I knew that it was important to carry on even through the sweating, the shaking and feeling of exposure when talking about things so close to my heart, my deepest fears, regret, guilt and shame.,Vulnerability and shame may be somewhat scary but they shouldn't be stigmatised,Vulnerability and shame may be somewhat scary but they shouldn't be stigmatised and deemed as negative emotions to hide away from. Something that we should all try and remember is that vulnerability really is our most accurate measurement of courage and understanding that courage is not the absence of fear but rather the recognition that some things are more important than fear.,I have struggled with my mental health on and off for years but I think I am finally at a place where I am somewhat comfortable with dealing with it. The help that I've chosen to seek is counselling, again. Before, I half-heartedly went but this time I almost feel compelled to go as I think it’s important for me to. I sent off my counselling referral form a few weeks ago and I have recently heard back from them. My initial appointment is tomorrow.,There really is no shame in talking about mental health,There really is no shame in talking about mental health (both positive and negative because we all have a state of mental health) or in seeking help when you need it. You may not need to tell the world as I do in my blog posts but please do not be afraid. You are not alone.,I hope that I, or rather Brené Brown, has given you some food for thought. Whilst you ponder over those thoughts I shall be recovering from my ‘vulnerability hangover’."
,"We always talk about ,, off the cuff phrases and discriminatory terms, but what’s the meaning behind the words? We often attribute misunderstanding, lack of knowledge or even malice to those who use such phrases. But what if we tried to decode them and realise their intention instead?,I've had a think about the various times people have used insensitive or misinformed language in relation to my , and I’ve tried to see beyond the initial frustration and anger at their ignorance. Instead, I’ve thought about what they might have been trying to say or wanting to say but didn’t know how.,"",” = I don’t want to accept that this might be long-term,"",” = It’s hurting me too much to see you like this and I can’t handle it,"",” = I’m trying to understand why you feel like this but I can’t attribute it to anything concrete. Maybe there’s something you haven’t told me?,"",” = I have absolutely no idea what to say. This is awkward and I feel like a total idiot for not knowing how to respond.,"",” = I don’t want to accept that you’re any different.,"",” = I don’t think I can deal with this yet,"", = this isn’t like you, and it’s scaring me,"",” = I’m trying to relate to what you’re saying because then it’s easier for me to empathise and understand,"",” = I miss how you were when you were happy, and I hope that person comes back soon,"",?” = I hope this is over for you quickly,This might look like merely blind hope or over-optimism. I’m not saying that those who use pejorative language are all well-meaning and simply bad communicators. There are undoubtedly some people who do have stigmatising or discriminatory attitudes imprinted and ingrained. But is that the vast majority?,When I really look back and think about who used those phrases, they are all people who loved me and cared about me. They would never have wanted to add to my pain or make me feel more alone. Yes, the words are fuelled by ignorance, or denial, or miscommunication. But they are also fuelled by feelings. Feelings of helplessness, desperation, confusion, hurt, rejection, anger, and fear. Those in contact with people with mental health problems need support too. Not just emotional support but support on how to communicate their thoughts and concerns in a sensitive and productive way.,I'm a great believer in trying to understand why people act the way they do, not just persecuting them or labelling them as ‘ignorant’. We can’t fight labels with labels! Let’s try and see the person behind the phrase, just as we ask others to see the person behind the mental illness. It’s only through understanding actions that we can start to challenge them, help them, and bring about change."
,"It’s an everyday occurrence boy meets girl. It is a normal process in life, to have the confidence and the curiosity to speak to the opposite sex.  Being part of Time to Change's youth panel I feel obliged to share the , I experienced on my way to a panel meeting.,Being early for the meeting, I decided to stop off to get a hot drink and shelter from the harsh breeze blowing off the Thames.  Having seen my favourite snack in a basket I ordered the pretzel with a hot chocolate. Next to me a guy ordered a toasted sandwich they got it wrong so he repeated it, which made me look over to him. “He has the same bank card as me”. I observe. ,Typical of Londoners in a hurry to get their coffee and go I thought. I have a sweet tooth I stop and add extra sugar. A seat becomes available next to the condiments table. I thought I may as well sit there. Sipping my frothy hot chocolate I realise the guy at the counter is sat to my right. I get my phone out to check it out of boredom.  I see my mum has emailed me, a daily exchange we have since I moved to university. ,""Are you French?” I turn towards him and smile “No, I’m English” I say in my Yorkshire accent. He said it must be your style that you look French. I’ve been asked where I am from many times never has anyone thought I was French before.  We get talking, flirting, asking questions.

I was coping with my severe depression and suicidal thoughts by , daily, even in the school toilets, just to get through the day.,However, all of that pain was internal. I wore a mask the rest of the time and nobody else at school had a clue what was going on inside my head. I decided to confide in a friend and, instead of being understanding, she was horrified and said “You can’t possibly be depressed because I’ve seen you laugh at jokes.” She went on to tell me about her grandmother who had ‘true’ depression and I was just making a mockery of people with real ,.,That left me feeling upset and confused.

,"From the moment I saw the positive pregnancy test right up to the day I gave birth, I just didn’t feel the overwhelming joy I’d imagined. It should have been perfect timing, we found out we were expecting just two days after our first wedding anniversary. But, although my husband was overjoyed and very supportive, I felt consumed by panic, shock and fear.,People told me my baby would bring me a love I had never felt before, that I would cherish holding my “bundle of joy” and I clung on to this throughout my pregnancy. My labour wasn’t exactly easy, I had an emergency C-section and when I woke up after a blood transfusion I looked into my little boy’s cot and felt nothing, just empty.,I remember people coming to see me, my sister saying I must be so proud, and I smiled along with them. The only person I could share my true feelings with was my husband and the truth was I didn’t have any.,I felt shamed by my lack of emotion,I felt shamed by my lack of emotion, as though I had let everyone down as a woman, a wife and a mother. I know this sounds selfish but I was consumed with wanting to go back to my life before when it was just my husband and I. I had spent a big chunk of my childhood caring for my mother and my first year of marriage had been blissful. I blamed my vulnerable little baby for taking this away from me.,For the first few weeks I played the role of new mum to my newborn, Andreas, but each day when my husband walked through the door I’d fall apart. There were tears, tantrums and anger, all from me, and I knew this wasn’t what motherhood was meant to be. The morning I finally admitted to anyone else that something was wrong, my husband had gone to work as usual and my son wouldn’t stop crying. I felt overwhelmed with anger towards him before the usual feelings of sadness and horror set in, how could I feel like this towards a baby?,It had been easier for me to smile and pretend everything was fine rather than share the pain I was feeling,I rang my health visitor and as soon as I said my name I burst into tears. Sarah arrived at my house a little while later with a student nurse and for three-and-a-half hours they let me cry my heart out. Sarah was shocked because she thought I’d seemed like a happy, laid back, first time mum. It had been easier for me to smile and pretend everything was fine rather than share the pain I was feeling. I remember the student nurse wiping tears from her eyes, it felt as though they were really listening to me.,Sadly, after that day I went into a shell and didn’t want to do anything with my son. My husband would come home from work and continue to take full care of our baby overnight before going back to work again and during the day my Nan would take care of Andreas.,It felt like I was constantly confronted with what a good mother should do,I decided to go back to work as a temp when Andreas was three months old but people would ask me why I didn’t want to be at home with my son. I did a college course and the lecturers told me I should be spending time with him. It felt like I was constantly confronted with what a good mother should do, all the things I felt I couldn’t do.,In August 2010, when my son was six months old, I still felt the same and after moving house I met with my new health visitor and told her how I was feeling. She told me about a support group for people with postnatal , but that I was two pegs above it and would bring other people down. I genuinely felt like I had been slapped round the face.,I was now able to look after my son on my own but it was tough,I was now able to look after my son on my own but it was tough. Then, one day I snapped over a small thing, Andreas wouldn’t let me put his trousers on and at the time it felt like a big deal. I felt anger, annoyance and frustration and held him down hard. He cried and I cuddled him crying my eyes out, he wasn’t hurt and didn’t have any marks on him but I felt so sorry I had let him down.,I didn’t tell anyone about this until a week later when I saw my Sure Start support worker. Soon after, social services knocked at my door telling me they felt I was a serious risk to Andreas and I wasn’t allowed to spend any time alone with him. My husband came home from work to find social services sat on the sofa, telling him they thought his wife was a great risk to our son’s safety. I felt like I had let everyone down. It took four and half months to get social services to believe I was not going to harm our son. I remember the day I received the letter to say the case was closed, I cried with relief.,[I] decided to be open to people and tell them I had postnatal depression and I am so glad I did,It was around this time I decided to go for a job at the same company as my husband. The interview in December 2010 was hard, I was faced by the two managers in my husband’s office and I wondered if they remembered. I felt like I had a lot to prove but decided to be open to people and tell them I had postnatal depression and I am so glad I did, because even now, each time I tell someone new it feels like I can breathe that little bit more.,At the time I was on the waiting list for Cognitive Behavioural Therapy but was visiting my GP on a regular basis. I was desperate to meet other people who understood how I felt so I searched on the internet and, as I read all the stories of other people talking about the same emotions, I cried. It felt so good to hear other people say they felt the same and that they had come out the other side.,I set up Pandas Foundation to give advice, information and support to other women,By the time Andreas turned 15 months old CBT and medication had helped me feel a lot more in control and I decided to try and set up a support group. I even went on BBC radio Shropshire to talk about my experiences. The feedback was incredible with both men and women saying they wanted more support. I hadn’t found any groups or support networks in Shrewsbury and very little in Shropshire where I live, so I set up , to give advice, information and support to other women who are going through this.,We now have 17 support groups running across the country. I just want people to know that they are not alone, each person is different and has a unique story to tell but depression of any kind is an illness. If admitting all of this helps just one person or family I’ll feel happier, perhaps it’ll make some of the tears I have shed over the last year worthwhile. Please don’t sit alone, stand together and be supported.,These organisations can offer , if you have had similar experiences., "
,"When you talk about being ,, you often see people giving you this look, like they're not quite sure what to do or say and they might want to run away. You can see them scanning the horizon for all possible egress routes. You feel like maybe you should stop talking. ,I understand that it's a difficult thing to talk about, especially if you have no experience of it. It takes a pretty special type of person to look you in the eye and say 'right, okay, I don't know what this is like but this conversation doesn't scare me and I'm going to be here for you'. ,I've encountered a few of these people. Having them stand by me when I've been going through the worst bouts of depression has made all the difference in the world. And I can't thank them enough. But then, there are people who don’t understand, and don’t know how to be around you because they don’t know how to deal with you, and perhaps they feel inadequate.,People who don’t understand can be quite cruel. It’s easy to be afraid that people won’t be supportive of you, and some won’t – but so many people will. And the more this gets talked about, the more talking about , will become normal.,some of the most painful and some of the most wonderful responses to me: the depressive,So I'm going to talk about some of the most painful and some of the most wonderful responses to me: the depressive (not to be confused with me: the photographer or me: the , or me: the professional or any of the other parts of me. Depression is just one part). ,When I was first diagnosed with clinical depression, aged 17, my best friend's mum told her she should stay away from me. To give her credit, she didn't listen. But this, my first encounter with the stigma attached to mental illness, was a big shock. Perhaps she thought that her daughter was going to catch it from me. Or that having depression meant that I was going to go on a crazy rampage, turning up at their house tearing my hair out and screaming in the street.,I thought of depression as something that wasn't real,To be fair, I wasn't the easiest person to deal with at that age. I didn't really understand what was going on inside my brain and I didn't feel I had any control over it. I tried to talk about it at school once and another friend told me to shut up because it wasn't like I had any real problems and I was insulting people who were actually ill with something real. ,For quite a long time after that, I thought of depression as something that wasn't real. And every time I had a low episode, or a panic attack, or couldn't stop crying, or felt so horribly bad for no real reason, or self harmed, I just assumed I was going crazy, because it wasn't real, right? So why was I being like this? My resulting moodswings and high maintenance behaviour probably wasn't very nice to deal with. But I remember a friend sitting with me all night one dark, winter Friday night, in my dark bedroom, while I just lay there and cried. And another friend taking me for a drive in her new car and saying 'look, I don't understand this but I'm worried about you'.,Last year, I had a pretty massive breakdown,Last year, I had a pretty massive breakdown. It was not fun, it took me a long time to recover and sometimes I think that perhaps I'm still not quite over it (although I'm a LOT stronger now and the new range of tools I have  in my arsenal to help me tackle my depression as a result of it are brilliant - some good came out of it, I'm absolutely sure). ,At the beginning I was a total mess. I lay on the sofa a lot, weeping into a cushion. I missed my own birthday party. All I wanted to do was stare into space and wear a giant jumper and eat crisps. My friends went to the restaurant we'd booked - why shouldn't they? - and afterwards a couple of them came to see me.,looked me straight in the eye and said supportive things and gave me my birthday present,It was brave of them. I must have looked like a disaster area, and my company was not exactly what you would call top notch. They didn't care and they weren't scared. They marched into the living room and clustered around the sofa I was huddled on, and looked me straight in the eye and said supportive things and gave me my birthday present, and the best part of it all - they handed me a supermarket carrier bag. It was full to the brim with crisps. And the message was clear - 'lying around eating crisps isn't ideal and it's not what we'd do with our Saturday night. But we're here for you and if this is what you've gotta do right now, we're going to help you do it'. ,Other friends, during that period in my life, took me for short walks around the block, brought me flowers, sat quietly with me watching TV, told me they were there for me. Some of 'em got annoyed and told me to pull myself together because I was letting everyone down. Some people just ignored me completely. In the end I learned to block out those reactions and just get on with what I had to do to get better. And that's the message, really. It doesn't really matter what anyone else thinks. But it would help a whole lot if people would understand mental illness a little better. After all, we all have a brain. We all have mental well-being. Some of us need to work on its upkeep a little more than others. The best thing we can do for each other is understand and help out where we can.,Make eye contact, bring them crisps, give them a quick ring,So, if you know someone who's having mental health problems, don't ignore them completely. Make eye contact, bring them crisps, give them a quick ring, listen to them. And tell them this: it's going to be okay. It's going to be okay. Until they are strong enough to say it to themselves. "
,"Since I was about 11 I have felt sad. I thought it was because I didn't have many friends or because my mum was quite ill. Things got worse when I became a teenager and we moved countries. I found it difficult to fit in, to find myself and to deal with my hormones. I started to , because that was the only way I could find relief from the chaos in my head. I had asked for some counselling but , was not discussed in my family and they told me it was not an option.,I don't know if anyone realised I self harmed but it was not discussed. Looking back I think it was because people did not understand or know how to help. I felt so isolated and alone. I wanted to end my life and remember attempting suicide at 15. People thought I was just seeking attention.,Things got progressively worse when I moved to England,Things got progressively worse when I moved to England. I felt lost and more alone than I ever knew I could feel. It was crowded and London was so unfriendly. I became an empty shell of who I knew I should be. There was no happiness to be found anywhere and I was a nervous wreck.,I then met my now husband. He seemed to be the only one who really saw me, who reached out, held my hand and kept me from falling into complete darkness. I did many things to him but he stood strong by my side and to this day supports me while I ride my emotional roller coaster.,I felt the world would be better off without me,Just before my 19th birthday, for reasons I cannot even remember, I took an overdose. My life was nothing to me. I felt the world would be better off without me. I was nothing. As I lay on my bed waiting for death, my cat Nikki came up and looked me in the eyes. She loved me and from somewhere deep, deep within me I was told hang on. I can't remember but I must have called an ambulance. I do remember I kept apologising to the paramedics and felt so guilty for wasting their time. My lovely other half came to A&E and he was so upset. To this day I feel awful for having put him through that.,We moved out of London to the countryside and I then slowly began to rebuild my life. I had kids young, which was difficult but the best thing I had ever done. I did have , after both and did not get much medical support. The kids were and still are the lightness that cuts through the dark fog. I have learnt so much from them and I finally now belong and fit in somewhere.,My kids and my husband make sure I don't disappear,I still get moments where I think they would all be better off without me and I feel like a burden. I still fall into the black quick sand and begin to shut down and disappear. My kids and my husband make sure I don't disappear, they support me and hold on to me. I owe them my life, my everything. We still have Nikki (along with many more pets) and to this day she is my special girl.,It is for my family that I have started a journey to free myself. It really has not been an easy one, and I'm sure as I go along it will become much harder. The first step for me has been to open up and tell people. In this society we are expected to simply plod along and metaphorically put plasters on severe mental injuries. This has got to stop and I am slowly removing all the cover up plaster and bandages. I am finally removing my mask. I’m finally looking within myself and mending things properly so I can once and for all move on.,I started a project called Unmasked,As a photographer, what better way to do it than through photos? I started a project called ,. This was a way to help me and others 'come out' and in doing so educate others and hopefully do our bit to help end mental health stigma. I really hope you will join the project.,I have also started writing a ,, which again I hope will help others see they are not alone in their struggles. I know that depression is something I will have to live with but I am getting better at noticing the signs before things get bad, realising things I have to do to help keep it under control and accepting and loving myself. I am not a failure, I am not weak. I am something and I am strong.,This is a hidden illness but hopefully by talking about it people will realise it is not something one can just ""snap out of"",I have not found much support out there, either from doctors, community nurses or counsellors, but believe (and hope!) that I can help myself. This is a hidden illness but hopefully by talking about it people will realise it is not something one can just 'snap out of' or 'cheer up'. It is a struggle and so, so difficult, lonely and scary. We are not alone, we have each other and we can get through this and help each other.,Jessy is on "
,"I don't really know how long I have suffered with , issues, possibly as far back as I can remember. I was only diagnosed in 1984 by a brilliant GP who had taken an interest in my situation because his wife was a specialist in mental health.,This was the first time in my life that someone took my feelings seriously rather than telling me it was all in my head and to grow up. In reflection those people were right, it was all in my head, just not in the way they meant. So, I guess, I experienced discrimination from the very first time I ever told someone that I had had enough of life and just wanted to die.,Initially I was treated as an emotional teenager; that would make me an Emo, right? I was told I was being immature for my age, that I needed to grow up and stop feeling sorry for myself. I decided then that it would be better to put on a front and let everyone think that life was hunky dory. Actually, I was desperately unhappy, unable to understand the destructive feelings that I was experiencing and convinced that the world would be a much better place without me.,the other GP's... asked me what exactly I had got to be depressed about,Aside from the diagnosis in 1984, all the other GP's I approached told me it was all in my head or asked me what exactly I had got to be , about. These stigmatising points of view made me even less inclined to be open for fear of being ridiculed. I was referred for counselling once (by the 1984 GP) and that was an experience not to be repeated.,The young man arranged to visit me in my home as I was signed off work and unable to face going out. He turned up wearing his white uniform, I remember thinking of all the jokes about men in white coats coming to carry you off and lock you away.,When he had reduced me to tears he asked me what I was crying for,After finding out some background information about me, he started asking me about my parents, who I love dearly, and then it was as if he was taunting me; asking why I had to have my life approved by them. He then started to point the finger at them as being the cause of my depression. In conclusion, he was tearing apart my childhood and blaming my mum and dad for it. When he had reduced me to tears he asked me what I was crying for and to pull myself together. That was the first and last time I saw him, I refused any further counselling after that.,Over the years I have been ridiculed, taunted, put down and blamed for a character moulded by mental health issues. I have been advised not to tell anyone I have these issues, especially employers as I would never get a job. I have learnt to keep my feelings to myself, which has not always been that easy.,My family still judge me, explaining my quiet, withdrawn behaviour as me 'being away with the fairies',I still fight with myself over my mental health issues as I can't understand why they dominate my life so much, why I can't just be 'happy’ and ‘normal' like everyone else. My family still judge me, explaining my quiet, withdrawn behaviour as me 'being away with the fairies'!,In fact, since my mum passed last year, I am treated as though I don't exist anymore and this just adds to the torment. Both of my children have blamed me for ruining their childhood by spending so much time locked in my bedroom during severe depressive bouts. I wish I could say that I have my mental health under control but I know that I don't. It still governs my life but I try to get on with it.,How is a person with mental health issues supposed to look?,I believe that the medical profession now respond more positively to mental health issues but it is still not seen as an illness in the sense that, say, diabetes and asthma are. I have been deemed to be 'cured' when I arrive at appointments with brushed hair, smart clothes, clean teeth and a clear diction. How is a person with mental health issues supposed to look? We may be in the 21st century but there is still a stigma attached to having a mental illness. Until this stigma has been removed and the myths about mental illness are busted, people like me will continue to hide behind a smile."
,"I have chronic , and in recovery from , (BPD). I’ve just finished studying pharmacy as a mature student. Now that I am so much better, I try to be as open as possible about my ,, challenging discrimination and misconceptions wherever I can, though I admit I still always leave out the BPD part and use the word “depression” to cover a multitude of problems.,There was one occasion, though, where I felt I had to challenge someone on their attitude towards people with a BPD diagnosis.,We had a lecture on my , course on various mental health conditions. Each one was factually correct and was talked about with an appropriate level of sympathy towards the sufferers. Then a slide popped up with Borderline Personality disorder and the 9 traits and the lecturer changed his tone changed completely.,He sighed and just said “These patients are manipulative, attention-seeking nuisances..."" ,He sighed and just said “These patients are manipulative, attention-seeking nuisances and are notoriously difficult to treat, so I won’t go into it any more than that” and moved on to his next slide.,At the end of the session he set us our coursework. We had to write a persuasive essay on a topic of our choice from the module. Perfect!,After the lecture I approached the academic. There was no good backing up what he already believed by appearing angry in any way, as I’d just be branded a “typical borderline” and I wanted to prove him wrong. He'd never met me before so I introduced myself, calmly saying: ""Hi, you know those untreatable nuisances that have BPD? Well you have one in your class...and it's me."",He nearly fell over backwards and looked horrified and awkward. I continued, ""Your prejudice is based on what you see on the outside, so I'd like to write about how I experience BPD from the inside and see if I can change how you see BPD sufferers"".,To my surprise, the lecturer said he would be grateful and honoured to read the essay,To my surprise, the lecturer said he would be grateful and honoured to read the essay. There was so much I could write about but I decided to base the essay on the 9 traits of BPD and what they feel like on the inside and the effects each one has on both my daily life. It was a Masters level essay, so I decided to make it very academic so that it was taken seriously, but interspersed with my own experiences and feelings.,The lecturer gave me 100% for the essay, along with an apology and an admission that I'd made him change his mind. I’d managed to make sure that he wouldn’t imprint those prejudices on other students and future health professionals. I’ll never know, but he might even challenge someone else’s view of BPD because of my being open. It was scary but worth it!"
,"Think of any advert you have seen recently portraying a new mum and her baby. I'm guessing the room in the background will be white with gleaming surfaces, a distinct lack of sicky muslins or half-drunk cups of tea, and most definitely mum will be back in her pre-pregnancy jeans. Mum and baby will smile and cuddle and laugh. I guess we all know that life won't really look like an advert but a subtle expectation pervades; motherhood will make you rapturously happy.,Three days after my baby daughter was born, I was indeed rapturously happy. Surrounded by flowers, a swaddled bundle in my arms, I felt incredible. In fact, I was so happy and overwhelmed with love that I couldn't sleep. I couldn't stop my mind and wrote endless notes about my gorgeous daughter and her special place in the world. Seven days later I would be admitted to a psychiatric ward, convinced that I had a mission from God to bring about the end of the world.,I was suffering from postpartum psychosis,I was suffering from postpartum psychosis (also known as puerperal psychosis). Although ,, I had never heard of it and neither had my husband or family. You won't find it mentioned in antenatal classes, or in baby books, or even in leaflets about , - save perhaps a scant sentence. But when my husband googled it to find out more, he came across horror stories of child murder and suicide.,Stigma hits both ways for postpartum psychosis. Firstly, the reality of this illness is hidden from view in pregnancy. Midwives are taught very little about it and it just feels too terrible to mention to expectant mothers that they might become seriously ill. So we don't talk about the early warning signs: sleeplessness, feeling very high and elated, or experiencing dramatic mood swings, talking or writing a lot, or developing unusual beliefs. And then the signs are missed and tragedies happen. Secondly, women with postpartum psychosis are portrayed as monsters on the internet with stories focusing on every salacious detail of the tragic death of a mother and child.,The reality is that many women, like me, go on to make a full recovery.,Even today, seven years from my episode of postpartum psychosis, it is difficult to find a , focusing on the remarkable recovery that most women and families make. BBC Newsnight recently featured a ,, yet each story featured risk to a baby's safety. The reality is that many women, like me, go on to make a full recovery.,Nowadays, as a , educator, I have the chance to tell my story to medical students and health professionals who will work with new mothers in the future. I hope that my message will be clear: severe mental illness after childbirth should not be a taboo. We need to talk about it so that we can recognise, treat quickly and prevent tragedy., "
,"I’ve always been someone who people generally view as easy going, opinionated, a bit of a laugh. I suppose I am all of those things but it’s not the whole story. I’ve suffered from bouts of major , and , throughout most of my adult life alongside long periods where depression hasn’t had any relevance in my life at all. I work as a teacher and have always done so, I also manage other people. My management style is somewhere between David Brent in The Office and Arsene Wenger.,The hardest part of depression is finding a way to tell people. It is like you are hiding a terrible secret. I think I felt ashamed of myself for getting depression, like somehow I had failed. That’s what depression does to you: it makes you feel like a terrible failure. There are still those quite close to me who probably don’t know that I’ve suffered from crippling depression. I remember that people didn’t know what to say in response. Someone offered me a ticket to an Elton John concert (insert joke here!),I tended to inch my way along to a ‘full disclosure’: How are you? ‘I’ve not been feeling too good’, ‘Not great’, ‘I’ve been better’, ‘A little down,’,I tended to inch my way along to a ‘full disclosure’: How are you? ‘I’ve not been feeling too good’, ‘Not great’, ‘I’ve been better’, ‘A little down,’…. If people still don’t get the message then they’re a little slow. Then of course there are some who don’t want to accept that you are depressed. They say things like “Oh, you’re probably just tired... you’ve been working too hard… you’ll feel better in the morning…” If you’ve suffered depression you’ll know how hollow these things sound. But, if you’re usually someone who likes to joke around, people find it hard to accept this new depressed you.,Wow, I’m sounding like a great conversationalist eh? But that was when I could even get myself to speak to people at all. In the throes of my worst times of depression, I couldn’t face seeing people at all or even speaking to them on the phone. Why? Because it feels as if you are not you anymore, you’re just a hollow shell. You can’t be bothered with yourself anymore so why should other people? How can you possibly tell someone that you feel like you want to die? 
How can you describe the arctic winter wipe out blizzard that has become your headspace?
But, I tried, I made a pact with myself not to hide if possible, to talk to friends on the phone, to chat about the cricket, because sometimes a tiny ray of sunshine in the shape of a story, a joke, an opinion, a kind word, would, just for a nano-second, help me forget that I was depressed. And that tiny moment is precious.,I was very lucky in that I was able to tell a close colleague at work,Incredibly, I was able to carry on working. I was very lucky in that I was able to tell a close colleague at work what I was going through. They listened and they didn’t judge. They knew that I was often on auto pilot, that I was operating at only about 30% of capacity, that I’d suddenly developed a need to go outside and smoke 5 times a day, but they didn’t treat me any differently than they ever had. Well that’s not true. They treated me with even more kindness and respect than ever before. But it was difficult. I’m the manager, I’m supposed to lead the team and I was really not feeling like leading. ,With depression, telling people is a personal choice. I think it is important to keep talking and to be honest, particularly with people closest to you. Of course no one should feel ashamed of being depressed (even though you do) but it’s probably wise to choose your confidants carefully at work in the same way as you might decide to share other very personal things about yourself only with certain people.,It doesn’t feel like it at the time but depression gives you an insight into suffering which can only help you become a kinder and more understanding person,Now that I have thankfully recovered I’m certainly more careful to look beyond other peoples responses of ‘Not so good’ ‘a bit down’ etc and just check that they are ok. It doesn’t feel like it at the time but depression gives you an insight into suffering which can only help you become a kinder and more understanding person.,Poem taken from my collection ,Some speak of moving through a spectral landscape,,
or the insistence of a black dog come to visit.,
Others describe the howling of an arctic winter,,
the roaring wind, the shrieking face of anxiety.,For me, after the white out there was dust,
like the aftermath of an explosion, that time,
before realization: suspended quiet before,
the wail of alarms or running of feet.,
A dust had come like a charm and settled quietly,over everything.,How that profound dust choked.,
Not like the slight honest dirt which rests,
almost politely on the edge of a sideboard.,
More a heavy persistent smudge,,
working into familiar places:,
a football game, a workplace, while cycling,,
the road itself, the cars and sky all draped,
in merciless grey.,
A fine silt collected on the faces of children.,At the point of despair, in the numbing,
muteness which is mental pain,,
we seek to give that thing a name.,
We mutter to the silent whiteness, show yourself.,
That we might find some tool to begin,,
Some language that could whisper in the dark: ,""...Here is a lamp, a candle stub.,
Here is a stick to beat the dog off.,Here is a tent to keep warm.,
Hold on. I will fetch tools, fire, food,,

,"I suffered from anorexia nervosa between the age of fifteen and a half and twenty-two and a half. That’s seven years of my life.  More than one quarter of my years.,I don’t know why I became ill. My parents loved me and I loved them and we have always told each other that. I did well at , but I know that my parents would have been happy so long as I tried my best. I had male and female friends. I wasn’t abused. Nobody in my family has ever been on a diet. I always ate well: fruit and veg as well as the odd pack of crisps and a cake. Though I could probably be accused of being over-sensitive, I was chatty and funny with plenty of interests.  ,I struggle to find a cause. Yet I know my parents will always blame themselves and the thought I’ll never be able to convince them otherwise is something I’ll always find hard to deal with.,that prolonged erosion of my self-esteem... had some effect on me,At secondary school, perhaps, was where things went awry. I moved up with some girls from junior school who, I can see now, were jealous of me. They made digs at my appearance.  I was called a teacher’s pet without basis – I wasn’t. I don’t like to lay blame when there’s a lot of literature now pointing to the possibility of a biological disposition towards eating disorders. But that prolonged erosion of my self-esteem – coupled with a personal and school-led pressure to succeed – well, perhaps both had some effect on me.,I don’t remember much about my descent into anorexia. All I remember is one day eating a tiny piece of toast with a tomato for my tea and wondering how I’d got to that point. I think perhaps my brain has blanked a lot of those years out. I passed my GSCEs, my A-levels and my degree. How I coped, I’ll never know. But with hindsight, I wonder if having these qualifications to focus on kept me alive.,A handful of strong friends kept me going. But many – most – drifted away,A handful of strong friends kept me going. But many – most – drifted away.  Though I was angry at them when I was first in recovery, I can’t say what I would have done in that situation. Maybe I’d have run away too. So I’ve turned my anger into a resolution that I won’t ever turn my back on a friend that needs help like I did.,I had counselling throughout my illness. Nothing helped. It was only after I’d returned home from university that things became untenable. I went to my doctor about something unrelated and she referred me – without my knowing – to an inpatient unit. I agreed to be admitted voluntarily but I would have been sectioned had I not.,My health restored, I was able to come home,It’s frightening to think I almost died. Specifically, that I almost killed myself. But my admission – maybe the trauma of it - marked a turning point in my mind. It was an awful experience that warrants an article of its own – but at the same time, it was the best thing that had happened to me for years. My health restored, I was able to come home. I’m proud to say I was the unit’s shortest-staying patient for a long time, if not ever.,It’s unrealistic to expect that I can have no regrets. Of course I do. I was ill for a significant proportion of my life – and at a time when a lot of people, however much of a cliché it may be, are finding out who they are and experiencing things for the first time, and having fun. When I first began to recover properly, I found myself bitter at people younger than me. I was jealous. That feeling made me very uncomfortable – it wasn’t their fault I missed out on things, after all – but I couldn’t deny it. I just had to cry it out.,Initially, during my recovery, I was unemployed and very depressed. ,Initially, during my recovery, I was unemployed and very ,. Though you’d have thought that, finally free from my eating disorder, I should have been happy, not having a job – a purpose – actually made me question the point of getting better.  Like the bitterness, that feeling was very unpleasant, and I had to work very hard to keep it from getting on top of me. On reflection now, I can see that early adulthood is a tough time for everyone and perhaps I’ve come out the other side better than some. ,Finally, the job came – and with it, a new start: a chance to do all that finding out who I was malarkey. And eighteen months on, richer by new friends (as well as a stronger relationship with existing ones), some money and, significantly, a sense of making a difference, I finally feel like I’ve caught up. I don’t believe things happen for a reason, so I can’t say everything’s how it should have been – but I’m happy I’m where I should be. And I’m confident that the person I am now can find better ways of coping with hard times.,You can find more information about anorexia nervosa on on the ,., "
,"When, aged 17, I found myself at rock bottom and in a fit of absolute despair was admitted to a psychiatric unit. I saw a string of doctors during my time there and various diagnoses were discussed. , seemed to be the most likely conclusion but, during a particularly erratic and incoherent period in my illness, the term ‘,’ was mentioned. That scared me. Not in and of itself but because by that point I’d seen how nursing staff had responded to the girls on the unit labelled ‘borderlines’. ,The staff seemed to project different meanings onto the behaviours of those with borderline personality disorder. ,, for example, was treated with sympathy in people with , but the girls with borderline personality disorder were often castigated for using it to ‘manipulate’ staff. It also seemed like there was a reluctance to move these girls over from the day unit to inpatient in a crisis situation – a general perception that they were ‘trying it on’. The list could go on; I had a general impression that they were seen as second class patients.,my condition improved and the possibility of me having borderline personality disorder was dismissed,Time went on, my condition improved and the possibility of me having borderline personality disorder was dismissed. I was still left feeling uneasy about the way those girls were viewed but perhaps I’d been imagining it? The girls in question were the only other adolescent girls on the unit so it’s perhaps unsurprising that I paid particular attention to the way they were treated. Yes, perhaps that was it, the nursing staff were professionals after all! ,Fast forward ten years and I’ve stayed well enough to finish college and university and to start my career. One afternoon at work was set aside for ‘Mental Health Awareness’ training. I’d silently giggled at the title as for much of my life I’ve been painfully ‘aware’ of ,! ,It seemed a lot like any other training session. Two trainers clicked through a series of slides and delivered basic but reasonably solid information on common mental illnesses. Then a slide came up labelled ‘personality disorders (borderline)’. The trainer looked somewhat disgruntled, ‘Well, we’ve got to talk about this’ she sighed ‘but I’m not sure we should have deal with these people as mental health professionals, we should leave them to the social workers really.

Not ill, just a ‘pain in the arse’? The slide remained up and she managed to list a whole host of other prejudicial generalisations ‘They’re the kind of people who turn up pestering the doctor a lot…. You can often tell someone’s borderline because their speech or their clothing will be very weird… when you see ‘bag ladies’ around town a lot of them will be borderline’. ,I couldn’t believe what I was hearing! I’d known girls with borderline personality disorder well and none of them were trying to be a pain in the arse, from what they told me they were struggling with extremes of emotion that I can’t even imagine. Their realities were often terrifying with a heightened threat perception or permanent fear of abandonment and they found themselves carried along by extremes of mood that left them feeling powerless and frustrated. None of the things the trainer was telling us rang true. I had no idea of the extent of the prejudice against borderline personality disorder and certainly wouldn’t expect it from mental health professionals who presumably know better.,To my shame I didn’t say anything during the session,To my shame I didn’t say anything during the session. I struck dumb by incredulity and self-consciousness but when I’d had time to gather my thoughts I put in an official complaint. To my even greater shame it may be the case that the staff on the psych unit all those years ago were indeed treating the girls on the unit prejudicially and I looked on and said nothing.,What I find shocking is that, ten years on, the prejudice seems more entrenched than ever and it’s entirely self-perpetuating. People with borderline personality disorder fear speaking out  because they’re aware that expressing hurt, anger or indignation can be interpreted as simply ‘being borderline’ and that being labelled non-compliant can affect their treatment. What seems clear is that this attitude is institutionalised, these attitudes have no hope of changing if they are not challenged first from within the professional community. Borderline personality disorder is one of the least visible mental illnesses but one of the most – if not the most - in need of anti-stigma message. "

My , have also been generally very supportive. I’m very lucky.,Recently, I looked more closely at the language I use when talking about my own mental illness and realised I was stigmatising myself. Far from being put down, abused or humiliated by other people, I was the one who had a problem with my condition.,When someone sees me taking my antidepressants and asks what they are, I laugh and tell them they’re my ‘crazy pills’. If I’m leaving work early or miss a night out because I have a therapy session and someone asks why I have therapy I tell them it’s because ‘I’m mad’. I use humour and flippancy to deter any further conversation, ending any possible enquiry with a joke and a move to a different topic.,what made me... belittle my illness when talking about it to others,I wondered where this came from, what made me react this way and belittle my illness when talking about it to others. From the nights spent lying awake, the days spent crying and the hours spent in confusion, panic or terror, I know this isn’t a small issue for me. My mental illness has had a huge impact and has been an important presence in my life, so why do I trivialise it for others?,Part of it has to do with manners. I’m a well raised British person and God knows I’d do anything to avoid making someone else feel uncomfortable and mental illness just isn’t a comfortable topic. If I start talking about the fact that I suffer from depression and anxiety and I take pills/need therapy to cope with that, we enter very personal territory and there’s a risk the person asking will not be prepared for that and will not feel comfortable with the turn our conversation has taken.,Some of it is bravado. I dread the day someone looks at me with pity,Some of it is bravado. I dread the day someone looks at me with pity or tells me how awful it must be to live with such an illness. I’m a strong and brave person in my own mind and I would be mortified to be offered sympathy, especially for something I’m actually dealing with.,Maybe it has to do with the complexity of the situation. The broken arm analogy is used a lot to discuss attitudes towards depression. If someone had a broken arm it would be obvious what was wrong with them, treatment would be easy to plan and administer and nobody would feel awkward about it. If I had broken my arm, I would probably be able to tell you about the source of the break, the initial diagnosis, the treatment and my future outlook within about two minutes. If I tell you I have depression, who knows where to start (or stop) with the other details.,Another option is, of course, that the reaction I would get might not be favourable.,Another option is, of course, that the reaction I would get might not be favourable. Not in a dreadful way; it’s entirely unlikely in my work or social life that someone would react with horror or run screaming from the mental. If I’m honest, a far subtler but far worse response could be forthcoming. I’ve lost count of the number of people who’ve told me that when they ‘feel a little bit under the weather’ or are ‘feeling a bit down’ they like to ‘keep busy’ or ‘pull themselves together’.,This kind of misunderstanding is almost always entirely well meant and comes with no malice or intent to hurt, but it can be devastating. Firstly there’s the pain of being open about something you find (or have found) incredibly distressing only to have it reduced to the level of a bad hair day or a dose of the flu. Secondly, there’s the horrible jealousy you feel knowing that some people can just pull themselves together and you simply can’t; try as you might, you can’t. This can be enough to spark off a whole dip in your depression: hey, once again, everyone else is getting up and getting on and there’s just you left behind.,But if someone asked me... surely I should be able to tell them without turning it into a joke,But if someone asked me, openly and honestly, what was wrong, surely I should be able to tell them without turning it into a joke. I’ve made a decision now to be more honest in discussing mental illness, particularly my own.,By joking I’m missing an opportunity to be open about a situation that’s important to me, to be clear with someone about something that’s really affected me.

The stigma of depression can be a massive weight on someone's shoulders.

,"In August 2011, after suffering with what I thought was just simple back pain, I was diagnosed with Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS), which is an auto immune disease and has caused the lumbar section of my spine to fuse together. This means that my mobility is very limited as a result and I experience stiffness and pain near constantly.,After learning of Ankylosing Spondylitis from my GP and researching on the internet, I got to know how this condition has affected other people.

Not only was my workload effected, my flexi time was gradually decreasing and it seemed that my colleagues were getting less and less tolerant of my minimal contribution to the team. I was made to feel that I was being lazy, unmotivated and therefore underachieving. I was even put on a capability procedure.,I tried so hard not let myself feel down whilst at work and not get upset by what was going on but it was very difficult.

I know columnists have to scrabble for attention in a crowded, over competitive market at a time the reputation and sales of newspapers are falling. But her dive for the lowest common denominator was sad to see.,Once you get through the sense that she views depression as a lifestyle choice of the rich and famous, who want a medal for having the 'bravery' to speak out about it, you are left with two main points of view in her piece: there is no stigma around depression; and 'everybody gets depressed.',The second statement reveals her ignorance of the fact that depression is an illness,,The second statement reveals her ignorance of the fact that depression is an illness, not a passing mood. Would she ever think to say 'everyone gets malaria ... everyone gets cancer ... everyone gets AIDS'? I doubt it, because she knows these are illnesses that strike some but not all of us. To say that 'Everybody gets depressed' suggests that though she says she knows depression is an illness, in truth she does not really accept that.,'Everybody gets fed up' would be accurate. I am fed up today because of the weather. I am fed up because George Osborne is Chancellor and cannot see the irony of the huge wealth he inherited on 'coming of age', and his attack on the something for nothing culture he claims to be dismantling by making the poor a lot poorer. I am fed up that Burnley keep taking the lead in matches only to throw it away. I am fed up that a builder in the street is currently making too much noise. I am fed up that in part because of the stigma and taboo surrounding ,, reinforced by columns like India Knight's, mental health services are being cut piecemeal around the country, with barely a flicker of protest of the anger that there should be as the most vulnerable get hit by the cuts. All of this makes me fed up, angry, not depressed.,I do not always know what makes me depressed,I do not always know what makes me depressed. What I do know is that I am currently on medication for a particularly bad bout which struck a few months ago, without warning and with real venom, which plunged me into an emptiness and mental pain I have known before, and which my psychiatrist felt required a sustained period on a new drug that I had not tried before. I get fed up taking it, because I hate drugs, but the depression has definitely eased, all but those closest to me have probably not noticed anything, and I reckon within a few weeks I will be off it, until the next time.,As for India Knight's claim that stigma does not exist, what I would say to that is this: I have no qualms whatever about being open about my mental health problems, not least because Time to Change is campaigning for genuine parity of understanding and services in physical and mental health. Added to which I am not short of opportunities, not worrying about losing a job or looking for a new one.,can take you to meet people who say the stigma and taboo leading to discrimination in the workplace can sometimes be worse than the symptoms,But many who suffer from depression are not so lucky. So when they are ill with depression, they are more likely to call in and say they have the flu, because people understand that; or say they have to take their Mum to hospital; or their child is off sick. All because they are not always sure how their employer or colleague will react. And that, dear India, is stigma, and I can take you to meet people who say the stigma and taboo leading to discrimination in the workplace can sometimes be worse than the symptoms. ,Or perhaps in addition to a response from me, you will get one from the nurse I met recently who felt compelled to 'hide' six months of her life from her CV, six months almost a decade ago when she was off with chronic post natal depression, because she was not sure how her NHS employer would react to it as she went for promotion.

,"I experienced , for years but it took something huge to make me eventually open up. It was no longer my choice to talk, it was unavoidable. I wish I had disclosed my problems sooner and had control over when the truth came out about my mental health. Just as it’s never too late to talk, it’s never too early either.,There were early signs that I struggled to maintain positive mental health but they were often dismissed as ‘bad behaviour’ or ‘angst’. I acted out at ,, constantly getting into bad situations and labelled as a troublemaker. My teachers always put it down to an ‘attitude problem’, never considering that rebellion often masks unhappiness.,I began , at the age of 12 to provide myself with an outlet, a respite and, at times, a punishment. But I found myself struggling to break the habit. Others started noticing but it almost seemed like people viewed self harm as a ‘rite of passage’ for a teenager and something that you would eventually grow out of. I did stop after a few years but I fell into deep , instead. I didn’t talk; I couldn’t talk. I felt like if I told anyone what I was feeling, they’d ask me why. And the truth is, I didn’t fully understand why and I didn’t want to tell anyone every detail of my past for them to try to discover a reason either.,I felt myself gradually disconnecting from the rest of the world,I created a world of secrecy and began leading a double life. I still rebelled, still played the class clown in school, but I would return home every day and break down. I felt myself gradually disconnecting from the rest of the world, almost like I was in a bubble floating miles away from everyone else; totally out of touch and unreachable. I continued to deteriorate and grew increasingly suicidal. But how could I possibly talk to anyone about wanting to end my life? It would seem like it had come from nowhere and would be even harder for those around me to understand. So I carried on hiding, unaware that it’s impossible to hide forever.,My mental health problems had become so severe that, at the age of 18, I tried to take my own life. The first glimpse of my difficulties that any of my , saw came in the form of a trembling, desperate mess lying in a bed in A&E with needles and tubes stuck in my arms. To this day, I am truly sorry that it got to that point and it almost hurts me more than depression itself to know how much pain I put them through.,I’d been suffering with depression for years and it took a crisis to make me talk,I’d been suffering with depression for years and it took a crisis to make me talk. It wasn’t my choice to disclose anymore; that control had been taken from me. Bottling everything up for so long meant it took me a huge amount of time to articulate what I actually felt; there was just too much to say. I ended up in the secondary mental health system, admitted to day hospital, and made further attempts on my life. I can’t help but think that maybe all that could’ve been avoided if I’d spoken out earlier.,Despite all the years of struggle and all the times I felt I had no hope, I did enter recovery and am now leading a happy, stable life, working for Time to Change on the ,.

Hearing that it is an illness that can and does affect anyone is enormously helpful. Learning that rich and starry people suffer too makes you feel less broken, less bereft.

It picked you, you didn’t pick it. You really are not to blame.,Taboos exist, certainly, but they concern people who are eating from bins and shouting at pigeons.

I can’t say it enough: there is no stigma.,No stigma? That would be funny if it wasn’t so serious. Ask anyone with depression who has a job and they will likely tell you of a tortuous process of concealment and subterfuge. Ask anyone with depression who doesn’t have a job and they will talk about an agonising dilemma in the hunt for work: to front up and risk not getting the job, or to lie and then risk being ‘outed’ in future. And that’s just in the world of work.,In our wider social circles, few people really want to come clean, particularly men. Of all the men I’ve spoken to about their “thing”, very few have been happy to be named or identified. Depression reminds me of what it might have been like to be gay in the 1950s. A nasty secret that you keep to yourself as long as you possibly can. The current incidence of depression is thought to be around three women for every man. I have a strong suspicion that that imbalance is simply down to the fact that a great number of men are keeping their wretched conditions very well concealed.,Everybody gets depressed, and one person’s depression is not a million miles from another’s. It also seems a given that depression is an adjunct of fame, at some point and for some period — it’s so obvious that it’s not necessarily worth wasting three chapters on. Of course fame is weird and discombobulating.,Wrong. We haven’t all had depression. It’s around one in four or one in five. Depression is very different from feeling a bit down. It’s not that Monday morning feeling, or returning from holiday to find the house has been burgled. It’s not even the end of the affair, or the loss of a friend. It’s far more all-consuming. We’ve all had a cold, but we haven’t all had pneumonia.,Yes, we read a lot about depression at the moment. Yes, it might be irritating for those who don’t really come across it in their lives to be constantly reminded of the agonies of the most miserable species on the planet. As one critic of my book Underneath the lemon tree wrote: “Far from being the illness that dare not speak its name, it is actually quite hard to get it to shut up.” That may be true. But it’s irrelevant. We don’t want to shut up until everyone understands that this is not a lifestyle choice or a niche thing that happens to a few wretched people in our midst but a very real, ubiquitous, debilitating, paralysing, often lethal illness that we should address and treat, not punish and marginalise.,This article was first published on markriceoxley.net"

In a new environment and with new people the façade became even easier to maintain, but cracks were beginning to appear. Constantly putting on a ‘happy face’ when I was in fact, becoming increasingly miserable began to take its toll and soon enough my depression had a companion in the form of nauseating, heart racing, all-consuming and entirely irrational anxiety.,Part of denying my illness involved  ignoring the reasons for it, I had suffered bullying at school that I was later informed was essentially child abuse due to the nature of it. I lived in fear during my time at secondary school and this was where I first practised not speaking out and even by 18 I had still never really spoken about the true extent of what I suffered.

Self-harm however, was still my little secret. It would take almost a year until anyone found out.

Those who did it labelled attention seeking or psychotic?,I was finally able to discuss with my parents, friends and soon to be boyfriend the extent of my illness,I was to find out I couldn’t be further from the truth.

My dad purchased books to learn more about my condition and how to help. This made me feel like my parents were on my side and were doing all they could to help me. It also made me feel like I wasn’t going through it alone., – It is easy for a parent to blame themselves, somehow thinking they have caused the illness either through genetics or the environment they have raised their child in. This, however, in many circumstances, is not the case at all. The only thing you can do is be there for your child and help them., – My parents encouraged me to go out and meet people and also to maintain contacts. I found this extremely helpful. Also, the Early Intervention team set up regular social groups and I have made many friends through this and participated in a variety of fun activities. There are schemes such as ,which is run by , as well as other youth groups run by various charities. The key thing though is to not rush your child into anything, it will take time., – A loving environment can be so helpful for your child’s recovery and wellbeing. My parents have provided me with a very calm and peaceful home environment since I left the hospital and purposely refrain from any arguing or conflicts, which I really appreciate and am massively grateful for. The whole mood and atmosphere of my household has improved and, not only me, but everyone is a lot happier and more cheerful., – When my sister comes to visit, she, my brother and I always do at least one activity together. Activities we’ve done together include going to the cinema, restaurants, the zoo, the sealife centre, amongst many other things. I have found that doing these activities has brought everyone in my family closer together and has caused us to bond so much more. Ask your child what they would like to do. Enjoy the time you spend together but understand that your child might take time before they start enjoying activities again., – I have been fortunate in this respect as my family have been so understanding and just want me to stay well. They are always there for me when I need to talk to them, whether it’s to do with mental health issues or anything else. My dad doesn’t talk very much but he always listens to me about whatever I want to talk about and this has helped me to get things off my chest and feel relaxed. Your child may not want to talk at first, or may only say a few words, but always reassure them they can talk to you as little or as much as they want in their own time., – In my case the effects of psychosis, after taking medication for it, took four to five months to completely wear off. Also, I had been depressed for a much longer period of my life but the medication prescribed to me has been amazing and has completely lifted my mood. I stopped feeling depressed extremely quickly, within a matter of days. However, I have been told by several mental health professionals that medication does not work for everyone. Mental health issues can be extremely complex and recovery can take anything from a few days to months to years. In some cases, the illness may be lifelong but coping strategies and/or medication can be used to manage it., – Please don’t be afraid to seek help or advice from mental health professionals. They have a vast amount of experience in dealing with people suffering from mental health issues and are an excellent source to get help and advice from. There are also support groups available for parents, guardians and carers to help deal with the whole situation, such as, carer support groups.,This is by no means an exhaustive list of what you can do to help your child suffering from mental health problems. There are many others things you can do but I hope these 10 tips will be a starting point when helping your child.,Find a list of ,.,Read more about specific mental health conditions on the ,, , and ,websites."
,"Have you ever felt so low you can’t even function?  I have suffered from , for 5 long years now and I know this statement rings true for me. The outside world seemed so hostile, so cold, and so bleak it was frightening to even place a toe on my bedroom floor. I felt like my bed offered me more solace, more peace, more protection, more comfort than I’d ever felt before. It was safe, it was a sanctuary.,I would close my eyes wishing I could just turn down the voices in my head and fall into the blissful quietness of a deep sleep.  I was so low, getting out of bed wasn’t an option. My excuse was that I was just tired. The constant bouts of depression were so exhausting that everything seemed difficult. ,I would just stay in a pit of misery for days only bothering to get up to go to the toilet. Nothing could entice me out of bed. Even on a good day I’d only manage to sit in front of the TV just blankly staring at it and I would long to be surrounded by my duvet in bed again and not engage in anything. My way of coping with the stress and anxiety that I faced was to completely isolate myself from my family and from work.,To her I was just some lazy teenager who looked a mess,To my sister my long days in bed seemed lazy. She made nasty comments such as “All you do is sleep” and “You are not going back to bed again you’ve slept all day!” To her I was just some lazy teenager who looked a mess. Sometimes if all you do all day is just breathe at least that’s something. My mum did stick up for me saying that ‘I was tired from working’. When you are so low and the comments people make when you do eventually get out of bed are so damaging it made me want to retreat more to my bed. So what if I spent more and more time in there? It made me feel safe and comfortable.,Looking back now I know that is no way to live a life. Being a prisoner in your own house isn’t lazy or enjoyable it’s more degrading and debilitating than anything. To get so consumed by depression that daily tasks are completely impossible is not laziness but depression at its worst.,it’s hard to describe how overwhelming depression can be,It may be easy for people to think depression sufferers bring it on themselves by not actively doing something to change their mood or outlook. But it’s hard to describe how overwhelming depression can be, how it strips you of everything and turns you into a zombie, a person that is not living but just existing. ,Please support Time to Change and change people’s perceptions of depression. Challenge the idea that it is just an excuse for being lazy. It is far worse than that. It is a mental state that can be life threatening. To make it out of bed, then out of the house, then to go to work or ,or the shops is a major achievement in trying to reclaim back your mind, your self-worth and your ability to engage in everyday life., "
,"Friends are there for a lot of your ‘first times’ – your first day at ,, your first car ride after finally passing your test, your first time out clubbing, but what about the first time you confide in them about your ,?,In my experience it seemed to be that no matter how close I was to my friends, it still didn’t make me feel any better about admitting I was suffering with , and anorexia. My friends had been there for all the trials and tribulations that life had thrown at me throughout school and the start of university but the idea of sharing a secret such as this with them, was one of the most terrifying things I’ve ever experienced.,All I remember going through my mind was a continuous string of ‘,’: what if my friend reacts badly, what if they judge me for it, what if they don’t see me as being me anymore and instead just this weak, moaning 20 year old? It took a long time to gather up the courage to say anything. I had kept things hidden for as long as I could until it became obvious to my friends that something wasn’t right. I was no longer the fun-loving, socialising girl that they knew so well. It was at this point that I told myself to grit my teeth and be honest.,I had planned in my mind to tell my two closest friends at the time.,I had planned in my mind to tell my two closest friends at the time. One who had been my best friend at sixth form and another who was a close friend and also a colleague from where I was currently working part time.,Whilst I had initially thought about planning what I was going to say, in the end I decided not to overthink it and just went with the flow of calmly explaining that things weren’t good at the moment and that I was feeling very unwell and low. I explained that I been to see my GP where I was diagnosed and immediately given medication and started talking therapy.,Both my friends immediately showed concern and worry for me,Both my friends immediately showed concern and worry for me, stressing that I should look after myself and that they would be there if I needed them. It was like the whole world had just been lifted off my shoulders. There was a sense of feeling within me that things were going to be ok after all, that nothing would change between my friends and I and soon I’d be back to normal and we’d all forget about my illness.,However this hope of mine was unfortunately short-lived with one of my friends. The girl, who was also my work colleague, whilst initially seeming supportive suddenly began to distance herself from me and no longer wanted to discuss my issues. This was in spite having told me I could talk to her.,she told me she couldn’t deal with me being unwell and no longer wanted to be friends,Eventually things got to the point where she asked me not to discuss any aspect of my illnesses with her at all because she decided she couldn’t do anything to help and therefore didn’t want to hear about it. Things went even further when eventually she told me she couldn’t deal with me being unwell and no longer wanted to be friends and even asked that we specifically didn’t work the same shifts together any more.,To say I was devastated is an understatement. Having been so frightened of being honest and admitting that I was really unwell and needed someone more than ever, it was heart breaking to then have my worst fears come true. She no longer saw me as the friend she once knew so well. Instead she now saw me as someone who to her was ‘troublesome’ and wasn’t the kind of friend she wanted in her life anymore.,It was so gut-wrenching to hear that [she]... refused to have anything to do with me,It was so gut-wrenching to hear that someone who I had been so close to for the last four years and thought would be there for me, suddenly hit a switch on a friendship and refused to have anything to do with me. I tried so many times to show her that I was still there underneath my illnesses; I was still the same fun-loving girl only I was hidden by a mask that needed to be ripped off.,Unfortunately the loss of my friend left me so empty and devastated I ended up trying to take my own life and as a result ended up spending a month in hospital, to help me recover.,My best friend from sixth form, who I also confided in at the same time, remained my rock,Despite this heart ache, there was light at the end of my dark tunnel. My best friend from sixth form, who I also confided in at the same time, remained my rock. She made me feel like there was nothing different or strange about me and that our friendship didn’t change despite her now knowing that I was, in my mind, a freak.,She consistently asked me how I was doing, how therapy was going and if I was ever having a bad day. She was always there on the phone or would drop everything to come see me. She came to see me whilst I was in hospital and never once got bored by the amount of times that I cried. Naturally, it wasn’t a completely easy ride for her. I could tell there were times when it was very distressing for her to watch me go through sheer hell and I know she deeply missed seeing me laughing and being so carefree. But she did what any friend could in such a difficult situation. She was simply there. And she distracted me from dark thoughts by treating me normally and getting us involved socially with other people.,I am so glad I confided in her because it made me realise that having a friend’s support can make a huge difference to your recovery,For this, I will always be eternally grateful. I am so glad I confided in her because it made me realise that having a friend’s support can make a huge difference to your recovery. It also helped me to develop my confidence and come to the realisation that if someone chooses to walk away from me because of mental health issues, then that’s their problem, not mine. I find it very sad that some people feel the need to do that but I can’t help being unwell. I didn’t choose it and I didn’t want it so why should I be left feeling like it’s my fault and that it must mean I’m an unlovable freak? I now know that I’m not.,Someone who chooses to end their friendship with me because of my illnesses wasn’t a true friend in the first place. And that’s ok because I know that there’s far more to me than my mental health issues and there are plenty of great friends out there who can also see that.,It is because of her that I am still here today, living my life to the full; proof that a friend really can save your life,Now I’m in recovery and my friend and I are still very close, though a little further apart because we are away at different universities. But I know she’s always there at the end of the phone. It is because of her that I am still here today, living my life to the full; proof that a friend really can save your life."

,"I had tried to broach the subject of my , issues, specifically major ,and ,, once or twice with my closest friend. The nearest I came was mentioning that I was taking part in talking therapy to deal with stress. I remember her nodding, agreeing that she too suffered from stress over college examinations and that was the end of the matter. I had gone into the discussion sure of what I wanted to say but, when the moment arrived, my confidence faltered.,The next time I spoke to her about my mental health was from a phone in an acute psychiatric ward, following a breakdown during my first weeks at ,. Though my mind is a haze, I remember hysterically crying, apologising for burdening her with the knowledge that I was in hospital and the enormous guilt I felt for revealing my dark secret. The conversation didn't last long. I imagine I was unintelligible.,She was taken aback by my situation, unaware that I had been suffering for the past four years,Two days later, she rang the hospital and we spent what felt like forever on the phone. First discussing my situation and my mental health history but the best part of the conversation was the support and love she conveyed to me in the time that I needed it most. After that, we spoke every other day and she eventually encouraged me to talk to my other best friend about my problems. She was taken aback by my situation, unaware that I had been suffering for the past four years. She too, was more supportive than I could have dreamed.,After leaving hospital, and after further recuperation at home, they visited me. I felt that my health had once again become taboo, my friends were unsure whether the subject was off limits. But over the following months, as I became more open and began to finally answer the question 'how have you been doing?' truthfully, the subject suddenly became normalised and I felt the immense pressure to hide this part of myself, lifted.,Being open and honest with them has changed my life,I have now realised that had I previously confided in my friends, they would have supported me and been just as compassionate.

The perceived stigma and fear can hold someone back from revealing that they are suffering. You could do the greatest thing for them, simply by lending them an ear. "

I genuinely did tell my best friend but she knew the gruesome bits of my life story anyway and I already knew about her mental health issues.,There are reasons why other close friends and family haven’t been checked off the list yet: the right opportunity, how to start and what to say, certainly; but mainly because it seems unessential that they know.

,"I developed mental health problems during an abusive relationship. When my partner of fourteen years walked out I was relieved but the reality of what I'd been living with surfaced. I basically shut down. I was unable to function. I lasted about three weeks before I had to stop working. I didn't eat or sleep. I didn't leave the house. I spent hours and hours sat in a fog, trying to survive the pain. I suffered from flashbacks and was permanently afraid.,I had begun to self harm during the relationship and battled with this afterwards too. I wanted to die. For a while, every day was a struggle to stay alive. The pain was unbelievable. Along with shame, self-hatred and many other negative emotions.,I knew I needed help to stay alive and sought it wherever I could. My experience of the assistance I received varied. At its worst it added to my trauma.,The first people I told were two acquaintances who knew me and my ex,The first people I told were two acquaintances who knew me and my ex. They expressed shock and were supportive at first but then went on to support my abuser and ceased contact with me, even when they knew I was suicidal. One of them was a psychologist who worked with people who had mental health problems. I could not understand how they found it acceptable to treat me the way they did. It added tremendously to my hurt and my poor self-esteem.,My doctor referred me to the community psychiatric nurse when I attended the surgery seeking help. I was appalled at the treatment I received from her. She listened to me talk about all the abuse, my self-harming, my lack of friends or support and my feelings of worthlessness and wanting to die. At the end of the session she diagnosed me as having severe anxiety and mild depression. She suggested counselling but I was already on the waiting list for this. She gave me some leaflets about cognitive behaviour therapy and how to deal with depression and said there was nothing else she could do and that she was discharging me from her list.,My boss at work was also very unsupportive ,My boss at work was also very unsupportive (although colleagues were kinder). She promised to refer me to occupational health so that I could access counselling more quickly. She never did this and I self-referred some time later. The counselling I signed up for myself took six months to arrive. I never forgave my boss for this. I suffered because she didn't care.,Fortunately, I continued to seek support and found it in other places.,The first was at a local centre for victims of domestic violence where I attended a weekly support group. The lady running the group recognised the fact that I was desperately alone and set aside time during the week for me to contact her. She did not have to do this, it was extra work for her. She was a fantastic support, had a good understanding of abuse and helped to keep me alive.,The doctor said... that I could go back and talk to her about how I was feeling,The other place I received support was from my doctor. I returned to my GP as I wanted to know if there was any other help I could tap into. I was offered anti-depressants, which I declined. After years of hiding my own feelings and suffocating my own emotions I knew I needed to open up to my feelings again. The doctor said there wasn't really anything else she could offer but that I could go back and talk to her about how I was feeling. I did this a few times until she left on maternity leave, each time staying around fifteen minutes (longer than an appointment slot). It gave me hope to know I had time coming up where I could talk and it was good to know she cared enough to let me do this.,I felt that my biggest barrier to improved mental health was my lack of friends.

And that by simply doing those ‘normal’ things you feel hot, sweaty, shaky, short of breath, scared to death and as if you might pass out.

Sadly all that does is isolate you from the people you love and care for.

The usual response to self-declaration of my health problems is, “I had no idea… you always seem so happy!”,When I post a Facebook update saying, “had a lovely day with my gorgeous son”, I may be saying, “I just about got through the day like a normal person...,So when I tweet, “well done me, today I did the washing up *pats self on back*”, what might be more accurate, would be “well done me, today I did not kill myself”. When I post a Facebook update saying, “had a lovely day with my gorgeous son”, I’m may be saying, “I just about got through the day like a normal person. Don’t think my son spotted that I’m angry and anxious and fearful of the day he realises his Mum is a mess”. ,So yes, this ‘honesty’ is still a mask but it’s as much a mask of protection for me as it is a buffer for the world. I don’t want to drag people down or make them worry about what on earth they can say to me because I seem so distant and desperately ill. I want them to be able to tell me the picture of my iced birthday cake sunny-side down made them spit tea, that my anecdotes always make them smile, or that they too cry when they watch, ‘Parenthood’, because the dysfunctional family is just so familiar.,when I have moments of fun and clarity I like to celebrate them and share them,I can’t make you feel what I feel when I’m ill and I wouldn’t want to. So when I have moments of fun and clarity I like to celebrate them and share them. I’m sad that this makes some people question my honesty and my sincerity but my ‘friends’ who feel like that can’t know or respect me. Unfortunately, it doesn’t stop me caring what they think… ,So the simple (ha!) solution is that I should be more maudlin and intersperse my brief forays with normality with more periods of introspective analysis and overt depression. Let art imitate life. But where is the fun in that? And wasn’t social media invented for socialising? Let me have my small moments of joy, please. Just because I’m smiling on the outside, doesn’t mean I’m not crying inside."
,"The question is not a hard one, when all's said and done. No harder than name, age, address, criminal convictions or any of the fields which form the mainstay of your average application form. ,Nevertheless, 'any disabilities?' is a phrase capable of rendering me wordless, not to mention the 'if yes, please elaborate' that follows it. I pride myself on being open about the way I experience mental health but I can't pretend it doesn't feel like a bit of a thankless task when faced with the fear that this same openness could be so very detrimental to my future.,I think the reasons for the initial recoil which accompanies admission of mental health issues are manifold.,There are no clearly drawn parameters to depression ,Firstly, ,(not dissimilar to many other disabilities I might add) is a word covering a wide spectrum of emotions, thoughts and deeds. There are no clearly drawn parameters to depression - everyone's experience of it is different. This, I imagine, makes it slightly more complex to cater for depression as a disability. The best treatment for one person may well completely backfire on another. There are no talking books, wheelchair ramps or braille to assuage these situations - just a turbulent, unpredictable volcano of emotion which can so feasibly erupt at any given moment.,Secondly, the use of the word disability in conjunction with depression is a contentious one - it sounds ridiculous to talk in terms of a hierarchy of disability but if that is the overriding principle, depression is pretty low down on the pecking order. I'd hazard a guess it's an issue of how much 'control' I'm perceived to have.,people frequently tell me that depression is just a matter of 'thinking more cheerfully' ,Even in 2012, people frequently tell me that depression is just a matter of 'thinking more cheerfully' or even, the manic depressive's bete noir, just to 'cheer up'. If we consider this in terms of telling a blind person just to 'look harder' or a deaf person to 'listen more carefully'... well, then we expose the latent hypocrisy here. I can no more control my depression than a wheelchair-bound multiple sclerosis sufferer can decide to start walking. I can minimise its effects, dull the pain, and carry on living but some ties are inherently un-severable. So to quibble my use of the term disability seems at best pedantic, at worst, ignorant.,As far as I'm concerned this quagmire which has become inherent in what should be a fairly straight forward application process is the result of people not communicating effectively or enough. The shame which is still so prevalent means not only that sufferers are unwilling to disclose the details of their illness but that non-sufferers are unaware of what depression, at the most basic level, really is.,So sufferers... employers or course providers are not afraid to ask to help,Time to Change, by encouraging the mainstream discussion of depression, could circumvent this.  So sufferers are not afraid to ask for help and employers or course providers are not afraid to ask to help. If an employer was seen to discriminate on grounds of race, he would, rightly, be blacklisted, prosecuted and condemned. It is time that the same standards were seen to be evident in conjunction with mental health. It's definitely Time to Change."
,"Having suffered with depression and anxiety for many years, it came as no real surprise when I experienced a breakdown after the death of my father in '94. Having been very close to him it was a huge loss. ,It came just a few months after a terrible accident at the ,where I taught, in which 12 children and a close colleague were killed. The compound effects of both experiences and my inability to deal with the grief led to my collapse. ,It was a collapse both physical and mental. After a period of time off work, some treatment at hospital and the support from my wife (we had only been married three months before the accident), I was able to return to work and get on with my life.,I had occasional bouts of depression but nothing like the breakdown,Things went well for the next ten years. We moved house, got established in our respective ,and in 2001 had our first child, a beautiful little boy, followed by another boy in 2004. During these years I had occasional bouts of , but nothing like the breakdown. I dealt with these by burying myself in my new ,, my career and self-medicating with alcohol, which seemed to help at the time (but of course it doesn't in the long run). All in all I was happier than I had been for many years.,After the birth of our second child, my wife became very seriously ill and was lucky to survive. However, the experience led her to re-evaluate her life and she realised she was not happy. The marriage then became increasingly difficult as we both dealt with the demands of young children and busy careers.,I moved to a new job in 2005... All was not well though,I moved to a new job in 2005, a significant promotion to a head of department post in a very prestigious college. It was the job I had always wanted and I finally felt I had arrived. All was not well though. Staff in my department seemed to resent me and I did not know why. I was not a demanding boss, put their interests before my own and generally did my best to support them . Things became increasingly difficult at work and at home. I felt I was under siege from both sides. Our youngest son had repeated bouts of illness which also added to the strain.,This situation continued until 2009 when I had another breakdown. The depression was back ""big style"" and I had to have time off work. My wife and I separated and I moved into a little flat. I struggled through the next two years and I'm afraid I had a pretty dreadful work attendance record. My colleagues became increasingly difficult, often making complaints to management behind my back.,My employer put me on what is known as ""Capability Procedure"",I saw my boys only four days out of each month and eventually ended up in a bad state. My employer put me on what is known as ""Capability Procedure"", a long drawn out procedure which is supposed to be used to support staff who for whatever reason are not performing to the required standard. ,In actual fact it is often used to drive ""failing"" staff out of their jobs by putting them under additional pressure of endless rounds of meetings, target-setting, performance management etc. I had seen this happen to other colleagues with mental health issues so I was prepared for what was to come.,My union secretary also reminded the college that ""Capability"" was not supposed to be used in cases of long term illness,My doctor wrote to the college asking them to suspend the procedure as it was contributing to my depression. My psychiatrist prepared a lengthy report including suggestions of how the college could support me. These representations on my behalf were largely ignored. My union secretary also reminded the college that ""Capability"" was not supposed to be used in cases of long term illness but to no avail. It was pretty obvious where things were going.,In March 2012 I was arrested in possession of an air-rifle, though no charges were made. Apparently, I had gone out to shoot a ""rabbit for the pot"". I have little recollection of the event but I was subsequently admitted to hospital and spent some time on the psych' ward. ,In fairness, the college were understanding (or was it opportunistic) and provided me with a dignified way out, a voluntary redundancy package and a good reference, which I accepted. However, I would have preferred appropriate support during the preceding two years to enable me to keep my job. I am a good teacher and students I taught did well and enjoyed their studies.,my actions played a part in all of this but so did ignorance and prejudice towards mental illness,So, in the last 3 years I have lost my marriage, my children (my wife no longer allows me to see them), my home, my career (I won't be allowed to teach again), my reputation and my self-respect. Of course, my actions played a part in all of this but so did ignorance and prejudice towards mental illness.,I remain hopeful. Losing my job is actually presenting me with new opportunities (that's how I see it anyway). Getting involved in Time to Change is giving me the confidence to talk about my experiences in a way I have never done before."

He has a very traditional view about 'the place of the wife'. Hence talking to him is almost impossible, let alone seeking support with clinical depression.,Being a full-time mother after working in an office environment for ten years proved to be overwhelming, to say the least, but to admit I had difficulty coping was even harder.,My husband to this day doesn't fully comprehend mental illness and how I'm affected by it. My parents are still unaware of my illness. I couldn't tell them as I felt it would be hard for them to take it in and they'd be worrying about me constantly.

And that of course didn't help matters. Arguments were commonplace and they didn't go unnoticed by our eldest child.,By the time I took myself to my GP, I was in such bad shape I could barely speak to her. I was sobbing uncontrollably and could only nod or shake my head. She rang my husband to collect me from her surgery and instructed him to watch me closely in case I committed suicide.,Even at that moment I couldn't take time out for myself,Now, you would have thought I'd be admitted to hospital and be kept on suicide watch, which was exactly what my GP suggested. But my dear husband decided it wasn't necessary. Besides, who would look after the children? Even at that moment I couldn't take time out for myself. And yet I'm still here, alive and kicking.

Convinced I was suffering from an incurable illness, I would spend hours reading the family medical dictionary.,I developed a fear of vomiting which escalated and started to take over my life.

I was unable to sleep properly, scared of being alone with my thoughts.,I reached the conclusion that hiding negative emotion was the key to maintaining good relationships,As a child, I did not know how to explain what I was going through to my parents. I found it difficult to control my anxiety which led to outbursts of rage. This caused conflict within my ,and I reached the conclusion that hiding negative emotion was the key to maintaining good relationships and to being “normal” and likeable.,I was bullied at school during my teenage years and this led me to a greater desire to be liked. I hid my mental health problems from my friends and developed a happy-go-lucky persona. If I did mention anything, it would usually be within the context of a joke.,I truly believed I had thrown it off forever,By the time I reached 19 years old, I felt terrible. I struggled to eat and sleep. I went off to university worried that I would not be able to cope. However, being constantly surrounded by people in a new environment, I started to feel a lot better. After a couple of short bouts of depression in my early 20s for which I finally sort help and was treated with antidepressants, I truly believed I had thrown it off forever. I got a job I loved, moved to London and threw myself into a hectic social life.,Unfortunately in my late 20s, once again following some stressful life events, my mood began to drop significantly. However, I continued to maintain my loud, outgoing persona, making regular visits to the pub next door to my office where my colleagues would make comments such as, “you seem so happy, what’s your secret?” and “I’ve never seen you without a smile on your face”.,my boss at the time noticed there was something wrong,Statements like these were meant as compliments but I let others’ perceptions of me prevent me from opening up to them. Despite my history, I decided that I wasn’t the “type” of person to suffer from depression. Surprisingly, my boss at the time noticed there was something wrong, took me aside and asked me whether I was depressed. Scared that admitting to my problems would damage my career prospects, I lied and told him I was fine, just a little concerned about my finances.,Ashamed of my behaviour at work which I felt was erratic and unprofessional I jumped at the chance to move to a new job which I was not capable of carrying out. I left a few months later under the threat of disciplinary action, escaping a bullying boss. Following this, I decided to go to my GP to ask for help.,I now take antidepressants and I am feeling a lot more positive.,I benefited greatly from receiving two years of psychotherapy on the NHS. I had a fantastic therapist who helped me on my way towards trusting my own emotions and judgements.

With encouragement from a close friend, I made the decision to go back to see my GP.

,"In my experience, you shouldn't expect too much of people when it comes to telling them about your ,. That's not to say we should all be cynical but I think if there's one thing I have learned it's that we should never undervalue the constant support networks in our lives.,I'm lucky for the most part, I have a partner who goes above and beyond when it comes to supporting me and he loves me at my very worst; having seen me in some really low periods. I was originally diagnosed with Severe Clinical ,in 2007, though I had been feeling 'not right' for years before that.,A counsellor at , had urged me to see a GP and only then did I get my diagnosis. I've since also been diagnosed with , and the two illnesses often feel overwhelming. Telling my partner wasn't a huge deal at the time, we hadn't been together long and I would rather him have left me early on if he couldn't cope. Instead, he stood by my side and has been there ever since.,I've heard all the cliches...,Unfortunately, this hasn't been something that extends beyond my partner and immediate family. I've heard all the cliches: that I just need some sleep, I need to snap out of it, stop taking life so seriously, stop being paranoid.,The thing I found hardest to explain to people was how my moods couldn't be changed by thought alone. It wasn't that I didn't want to feel happy. I couldn’t feel happy. ,eventually stopped inviting me out, stopped replying to messages and drifting out of my life. New friends I make along the way invariably drift off too, usually after the first time they see how low I can get during a particularly bad relapse. I don't blame them for it, but it certainly makes it much harder to speak freely about my health when new people arrive in my life.,it's still initially hard to have that talk and tell them I take medication for a mental illness,Every new person I speak to brings a new perspective to things and I welcome fresh outlooks but it's still initially hard to have that talk and tell them I take medication for a mental illness and have regular therapy.,I don't want this to be a negative take on telling those you care about that you are suffering or have suffered. I admire those that are able to talk about their diagnosis without flinching and it's what I have come to aspire to.,My parents and my partner have been constantly supportive and never impatient,Given that I've suffered with spells of depression for almost 10 years now it can be extremely difficult to see a brighter future but I won't give up. Why? Because of this immediate support network I have. My parents and my partner have been constantly supportive and never impatient. ,If you have someone in your life that laughs and cries with you, that doesn't hesitate to grab your hand and guide you into the light when it feels too dark, treasure them. Cherish them. Find strength in their love because I know just how powerful it can be in battling depression."
,"I was diagnosed in 2008 with ,and ,. Suddenly, the rumble of feelings that had been gradually affecting my life more and more had a label and I was given something concrete to tell my , and teachers, which explained why I hadn’t ""been myself lately."",For all the relief of facing treatment, it was a fairly daunting thing. I started by telling someone who I trusted deeply because I wasn’t too sure what it all meant myself and, just like me, she didn’t get it. The essential thing was, though, that she was there; giving me time to cry and time to talk, without making any comment, but offering her care and a hug. That was enough.,Other friends weren’t so understanding. I found it monstrously frustrating trying to open up to someone who would turn around and say, “yeah me too,” or start talking about themselves, when I needed only comfort, not comparison. With time I began to realise that people don’t have much of a vocabulary for , – we never got taught in , how to respond when someone says, “I’m struggling,” let alone how to cope if we’re struggling ourselves.,If a friend tells you that they are suffering with mental distress, you might feel pretty mixed up too. You might feel worried, angry, scared or confused. I’ve written these , of talking about mental health problems. I hope that they suggest how you can manage your friendship and offer support.,First and foremost, you need to look after yourself. It is ok to say to your friend that you don’t feel like you are able to support them if you are feeling bogged down yourself. Being a great friend means remembering to care for yourself first so that you can be strong when your friend really needs you.,There are a lot of myths in the media and whispers that get passed around about mental health. If you are interested, there is nothing shameful about reading up and learning from reliable sources what is really involved – chances are it’s not nearly as scary as you think. This way, you can be there for your friend and offer some understanding.,It is important to listen to your friend and to hear what they are saying. You might want to try to fix their problems or to find a solution to what they are struggling with, but often it is better just to offer a shoulder to cry on, rather than to try to be Superman. Your friend will appreciate you saying, “I am here,” rather than “You need to...” People are often tempted to say, “I understand,” but everyone’s journey is personal and unique to them. It is good to offer your listening ears and to allow your friend the space to express themselves, rather than making comparisons with your own experience.,As you care for your friend, you’re bound to have questions. Sometimes, your friend won’t be able to answer them because it’s often as bewildering for them as it is for you, or they might be tired out from talking, so ask enough to help you understand, but not so much that it is intrusive – remember these are very personal things and your friend has had to be brave to open up to you. They may or may not want to tell you a lot, so let them take the lead.,It takes an awful lot of courage to stand up and tell someone you are suffering with mental health problems, even your closest friends. Your friend might feel nervous that they will lose your friendship or that you will judge them. It’s a privilege when someone shares intimate details of their life, so treat them carefully and gently and let your friend know they can trust you.,Your friend may want more time alone than before, or they might be snappy, tearful or even hyperactive sometimes and you might feel that your friendship is changing. It’s never easy but try to remember that your friend is still the person you know and love, even when they are struggling.,It’s important to keep your friend’s personal issues confidential but if you are concerned speak to a trusted adult like a teacher or your parents. Equally, if you’re feeling troubled or if supporting your friend is getting you down, it’s ok to take some time for yourself and to talk to someone. Your friendship is important but so are you.,Learning that someone you love is suffering is always tough, whether it is a friend or a family member. It isn’t always easy to support someone that you love either and it’s ok that sometimes you might feel pretty fed up or down yourself. However, offering someone compassion and friendship when they are at their lowest is a brave and tremendously kind thing to do and above all, you should feel proud of your love for your friends.,I took a risk in opening up to my friends about my problems and, sometimes, they didn’t offer the support that I had hoped for. The ones who really helped were the ones who didn’t say, “Everything is going to be ok,” or “I understand,” but who were simply there, for a moan or a giggle or offering a hug just like always and who were delighted to see me when I began to come out the other side."
,"In 2001 after struggling with repressed feelings over my eldest daughter’s disability, I experienced a breakdown. A house move proved to be the straw that broke the camel’s back. Between then and 2010 I’d had a couple of other , but I was always able to recover quickly thanks to the immense support of my ,, a great GP and continued medication.,However in 2010 my marriage fell apart after my wife felt she could no longer cope with my depression and started to see someone else. The depression I fell into when I realised my marriage was over was more severe and more acute than it had ever been before.,My carpentry business was on the slide so I asked the trustee of a big cat charity that I volunteered for if there was any chance he could offer me a job as part of the maintenance team. He was aware of my personal circumstances but not my history of depression. Fortunately he did offer me a job, which was such a boon on so many levels. Firstly, I had a full time job. Secondly, I got to work all day everyday around the animals I love. Thirdly, I would have the support and love of my closest friends who I had made in my three years at the big cat sanctuary.,I was always open about my depression if anyone asked,I attended a staff induction where I filled out a personal information form detailing amongst other things any medication I took. So I put down that I took Flouxetine as I was always open about my depression if anyone asked. There was also a presentation where the trustees, amongst many other aspects of HR, said they would look out for and support vulnerable members of staff if it came to their attention.,Three months into my job, despite loving every minute of it, my personal life became so traumatic that I attempted suicide and overdosed on tablets. After taking a week off to recover at the trustees request, I returned to work to be told that they could no longer afford to keep me on and they went to great pains to say it had nothing to do with my recent illness. They even said I was welcome back anytime.,even if they don’t have the money at least I can still come back as a volunteer,That’s ok I thought to myself. Times are hard for everyone and even if they don’t have the money at least I can still come back as a volunteer. However, a couple of weeks later when I asked to come back as a volunteer I was told that I needed at least a six week ‘cooling off’ period. When I calmly asked what it was I needed to cool off from, communication ceased. Countless polite answer phone messages, emails and letters of support from myself, my GP, counsellor and a Rethink advocacy worker all went unanswered. ,Finally after two months of trying to ask simply for a trustee to sit down and talk about whatever issues they had with me, I received a phone call from one of the trustees. She told me I wouldn’t ever be coming back onsite again and that she didn’t have to explain her reasons as I was only a volunteer and promptly hung up on me.,The big cats were my life, my therapy. My close friends there were my support group and my rock. If you can think of the amazing effect that animals can have, such as horses with autistic kids or dolphins with disabled people, then it’s not hard to imagine how much of a positive effect working with lions and tigers can have on my well being.,what hurt the most and still hurts today nearly two years later is the discrimination and stigma I experienced,It hurt being ripped away from them. It hurt being removed from somewhere that I loved and had invested so much in emotionally. It hurt not seeing my close friends every day. But what hurt the most and still hurts today nearly two years later is the discrimination and stigma I experienced. All of which could have been dissolved if the trustees had only had the courage to sit down and talk with me.,Today, the majority of my friendships have suffered as I no longer see my friends on a daily or weekly basis and I feel very isolated, so I have explored the opportunities for a new beginning working with lions in Africa. To date it has been to no avail but I live in hope.

I would no longer need to put on my mask - something that was exhausting. I had also become aware of The Time to Change Campaign.,After disclosing more widely in work, I felt a sense of relief and pride. There was a resulting change in me that was positive and I felt the best I had done for many years. Unfortunately a small minority of my ,were surprised by my openness.

They took these concerns to management. I was later called to management, told that there had been concerns raised but was refused the opportunity to address them (presumably because they had concluded I was definitely unwell). My role and responsibilities were taken away from me on the basis of these subjective opinions, observations and concerns. ,My partner of 13 years, my CPN, Psychotherapist, Psychiatrist and Occupational Health Consultant all agreed that I was not unwell throughout this time.

I am not saying don't disclose but do not assume that others are as well informed about mental health as yourself.,in 2012 there is still much ignorance about mental health in society,Although still ongoing even after 8 months, I am hopeful that eventually this situation will be completely resolved and I will be able to look back on this scenario positively somehow. 
 My story highlights that in 2012 there is still much ignorance about mental health in society in general and even health professionals. It is this ignorance that  can lead to stigma and discrimination and consequently a lot of unnecessary pain for all parties involved. ,It's not just about talking more openly about mental health, , and having a better understanding about mental health too."

It’s also such stigma – the fear that people will question my integrity  - that I and others suffering from mental illnesses need to rid themselves of.,People may snigger, take the piss... but if my blogging helps just one person in a similar situation...,People may snigger, take the piss, laugh with their friends, but if my blogging helps just one person in a similar situation, or somebody who is currently locking them self away and battling mental illness, then so be it. Believe me I am no Mother Theresa. For one, I am male and therefore cannot be considered a Mother. But I do know that talking with others in a similar situation does help... "
,"I have been battling with ,and an eating disorder since my early teens, over half my life. Yet I spent the majority of this time lying about it. ,This pattern of behaviour was learnt from my ,. My absence at family gatherings was always explained away by headaches, exam revision or holidays.,This ‘protection’ from shame that was actually stoking the fires of social stigma impacted on me and I began to internalise the lies. When my problems came to a head in my late teens my mother took to me see specialists, but I denied my illness to them. Ironically, I made up stories about family commitments when I couldn’t make it out with friends. ,In later years, I explained the gaps in my C.V. with more socially acceptable, physical problems during interviews and in jobs. I even lied to myself. The self-stigma ran deep.,my words and actions were building a web of deceit that was becoming difficult to maintain,I was unaware of the repercussions this would have on my self-esteem. I thought I was protecting myself but my words and actions were building a web of deceit that was becoming difficult to maintain. I simultaneously inhabited two worlds yet the pressure of doing so intensified my illness and I was constantly living in fear that my ruse would be discovered. In effect, I was acting as my own worst enemy, strengthening the walls of stigma I privately and so desperately wanted to tear down.,Thanks to the help of a training project with my local Mind the transformation from reinforcing the lie to spreading hope through honesty began to take shape. The project encourages service users to give personal testimonies of their lived experiences with , in training sessions arranged to raise awareness of mental health amongst employee’s of local businesses, statutory services, other charities and community organisations in the area.  It was a daunting step after so long in denial.,I took the plunge to bear my history in public,However, I realised the value the opportunity and took the plunge to bear my history in public. Spurring me on was hope. Hope that my story could help others understand the causes behind my illness, the behaviours it brings to bear and the coping strategies I employ all of which had been my private world.  Hope that I could encourage people to approach mental illness with less caution, start conversations with less judgement and discover the similarities between us often outweigh the differences. And finally, hope that in the process it could change how I see myself. ,As I am a victim of the stigma I fight, I was intensely worried that my story would be negatively judged and the vulnerability of exposure would heighten my nerves. Yet these worried remained unproved.  As the only expert on the subject matter of my life I found the nerves subsided at ‘Good morning.....’ and when the session closed I was met with kindness. People valued my candid account and applauded my bravery.  I was genuinely shocked, yet, at the same time, satisfied.,I never imagined that my secret shame could be turned into a vehicle for change and progress,I never imagined that my secret shame could be turned into a vehicle for change and progress. But as it was my secret desire too, I could not have been more pleased.  Not only were my new steps in honesty helping to hack away at the stigma ‘out there’, its reception was helping to melt the stigma I had comforted myself with ‘inside’ and the empowerment of this honesty lingered. Subtly, I felt it infuse my days with a renewed sense of confidence. ,With this in mind, I encourage anyone hiding the light of his or her story behind false shame to let it shine out. Be proud to talk with honesty where you feel comfortable, whether this be with family members, friends, or in a more public forum like I did. The fight is harder where you stand now; so let honesty ease the burden. "
,"""What is normal?"" This is a question I've mulled over at many times in my job and personal life.,I always considered myself to be pretty 'normal'; good, solid upbringing, parents married (and still are), close ,ties, good education and a trusted circle of friends. Only recently things have unravelled beyond anything I could have imagined...,That is not the opening line to some fantastical story. It's real and has tested everything I am. Without explaining my entire life history, I've been in a long term relationship since my final years at ,and was happy enough as far as my judgement of a relationship goes. ,I started to have feelings of general uncertainty about 2 years ago. I shrugged them off as work stress as I was teaching at the time and finding it a massive challenge to my organisational skills, time, patience and mental abilities. It was also something of a distraction from the real issues I've been fighting with for a long time. At this point, I'll add that I won't discuss my partner, as she has been, in my eyes, faultless.,You're not depressed, you're a lazy student and you are not a good partner,Flashback to when I was at university and struggling with juggling the demands of a degree, social life and a serious relationship. Through lethargy and apathy, I considered the idea that I might have ,, so consulted my GP. His words (and I paraphrase only slightly) were: ""You're not depressed, you're a lazy student and you are not a good partner, you need to get real and start acting like a grown up."",Not one to question the advice of a professional, I took this in and got on with life. Finished my degree, got a job, of sorts. Got married, moved again, got a more 'grown up' job. I can't see a point where it all began to unravel but it l did. I didn't deal with things, rather hid any feelings of self-doubt, lack of self-confidence, uncertainty or unhappiness away to try and maintain the life I'd built up.,it takes a damn good actor to hide them in the long term,Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying it wasn't a perfectly good life to lead and I was loved. However, when you have so many issues bubbling away under the surface, it takes a damn good actor to hide them in the long term. I've made decisions that have led to my own undoing, overlooked the things I truly wanted and most importantly of all, not spoken up about things when they got bad. ,The breakdown of my relationship was the hardest thing I've ever had to face, especially dealing with the fact it was my decision to end things and what effect it had on the other person. Saying that, it's the first time I've spoken about all my insecurities and 'flaws' (as far as I saw them) and my partner was amazing in listening to this and helping me through, even though I was orchestrating the end of things between us.,I've spoken to many people about all of my issues with depression,Getting back to the present, I've spoken to many people about all of my issues with depression and feelings of low self worth. I've sought help from organisations and GPs and I feel positive. Going it alone after 10 years is hard. I knew it would be but the one thing I've learned is not to hide behind this 'black dog'. ,It was for fear of not being understood by others, even friends and family, that I hid it all away, but all it did was break me down. It's hard to talk about mental health issues when it's such a sensitive issue but when I did I was surprised and shocked in some cases at people telling me their experiences, even family. It really makes you feel less secluded and alone to know that other people have these kinds of issues.,The first step is talking to someone about it,The first step is talking to someone about it: a friend, relative, counsellor, GP, even social networking helps at times. As hard as it is, there is support out there. Yes, it's scary and you might think no one will understand or care but they do. All the worries about others’ perception of my issues were unfounded. My friends have accepted it with open arms, colleagues too. My family have been amazing and I realised that we don’t talk enough. Things get better.,If you're wondering...I don't think there is such a thing as normal. We're all very different, unique, constantly-changing individuals and we all have different strategies and ways of coping but, in the end, we're only human."
," ,When I was contacted by Time to Change about advising a ,series with an upcoming , story line I never imagined it would be as such a high profile programme as Eastenders!,Contact was quickly made with the research team and many emails and phone calls were exchanged over a period of time, the outcome of which was the Ian Beale breakdown story. My input was welcomed and I quickly realised that this was going to be something I could really help with; I could draw on my own experiences and do my bit to make sure that Ian’s illness was portrayed accurately and as far as possible, realistic and believable. ,Mental illness is a massive umbrella covering a vast array of different diagnoses. One of the biggest challenges in creating awareness of mental health issues is breaking down the stereotypical way people think when confronted with the term “mental illness” and Ian’s breakdown is just one of so many different ways that the illness can manifest itself.  My personal experience is of a mental breakdown and ,/,disorder and I could really empathise with the story.,Right from the start of my illness I was advised to start a ,. I was told it could prove to be very therapeutic and it was. I wrote as often as I could, the good, the bad, and the indifferent. Eventually I plucked up the courage to share the blog with a few close friends and eventually it became even more public. Some of the entries (especially the very early ones) are quite painful to look back on, but that was me at the time, that was my life, and it helps me when I am having a bad day to look back and see where I was then and how far I have come since those dark horrible days.,One of my blog entries recalls an episode where I was walking along a duel carriageway completely lost and in total despair. As you can imagine I found it very tough to watch Ian do a very similar walk in the episode when his breakdown completely hit. I have to say that Adam Woodyatt who plays the character Ian Beale played the part superbly well. The whole build up was acted brilliantly and the exit was outstanding in my opinion. Having seen some of the comments on social media sites it was also widely praised for being both moving and realistic.,My experience of helping out with the story was enormously positive. The people I was in contact with were superb and could not have been more supportive and understanding of the issues which they were portraying.,What next for Ian ? ... well, you will have to wait and see. I just hope that in some small way I have managed to do a little bit to make people see that mental health issues can affect anyone at any time and if this venture encourages just one or two people to challenge their pre-conceptions regarding mental health issues I will consider it a massive success., , "
,"Nothing prepares you for your child being affected by a ,. There is nothing in the parenting manuals that can help you to understand and cope with the total change that comes over someone once they are in the grips of such an illness. I can only describe it as truly shocking, terrifying ... and utterly bewildering.,In the early part of 2009, my daughter, Jess, was, seemingly, your average 15 year old – an attractive, popular, bright girl, with many ,and a prediction of good grades at GCSE. Whilst not a confident girl, Jess lived a full life and was involved with a local drama group, played the saxophone, and was a member of the local swimming club. And then something changed ...,In the months that followed, Jess became crippled by a total lack of confidence - in herself as a person, her abilities, her appearance, her reason for being. She developed issues with food, began self harming on a daily basis, and her anxiety levels were such that attending ,became all but impossible. She was ,, rarely leaving her room, cutting herself off from her friends and everything that had previously made up her life.,In just 6 short months, Jess went from leading a normal life to being admitted to an adolescent psychiatric unit.,What do you do when your beautiful teenage daughter says to you, “if you love me Mum, just let me die”? That was, beyond all doubt, the most heartbreaking and devastating moment of my life - a true moment of despair and one which will remain with me forever. In just 6 short months, Jess went from leading a normal life to being admitted to an adolescent psychiatric unit.,At various points throughout Jess’s illness, on top of coping with the symptoms and repercussions of the illness itself, she has also had the difficulty of knowing how and what to tell others about what she’s been going through. Whilst Jess had many school friends, there were very few who she ever told about her problems. This was partly because she was ashamed, partly because she didn’t want to worry or frighten them, and lastly because she was afraid of their reactions.,Most of them only knew the full extent of her troubles the day before she was admitted to the psychiatric unit, when she went in to school to tell them that she wouldn’t be around for a while. Sadly, for some of them, what Jess was going through was simply too much for them to take on and their life and hers have since taken very different paths.,What a difference it would have made if the school had known how to handle Jess’s illness,What a difference it would have made if the school had known how to handle Jess’s illness, how to help her talk about her troubles, had had information to pass on to her friends. As it was, I had to find information to pass to the school, to her friends and teachers. Jess herself subsequently advised the school on tell-tale signs to look out for to identify self-harming.,Rumours amongst Jess’s peers about why she was absent from school ranged from her being in prison, having had a serious car crash to facial reconstruction! Had she, God forbid, got cancer or even a broken leg, these rumours would not have been circulating because people would have simply known the truth and would have understood what she was going through.,when Jess eventually returned to school just before her GCSEs, she didn’t know what to say,As it was, when Jess eventually returned to school just before her GCSEs, she didn’t know what to say and nor did anyone else ... so nothing was said! Having been absent from school for nearly 8 months, and in a psychiatric unit for 5 of those months, she just had to try and slot back in and carry on as though nothing had happened. In the end, it was just simply too stressful for Jess to be at school except for a few hours here and there.,Despite this, through sheer determination and will, Jess sat 8 of the 11 GCSEs that she had originally been intending to take. I am immensely proud of her that she passed all of those exams. There are few who would have put themselves through even going back into school after everything she had been through, let alone taking the exams. Subsequently, she went on to College to do a two year Advanced Diploma in Health and Social Care, which she completed last week with 2 Distinctions and a Merit – equivalent to 3 A Levels at grades A A C.,she carries with her the stigma of mental illness as she now moves on to find a job,And yet, despite these amazing successes, she carries with her the stigma of mental illness as she now moves on to find a job. Yet again she is faced with the decision of what to tell people about her mental health issues. She would like to be able to explain why she “only” has 8 GCSEs (her words, not mine!) and; that her experiences have made her a stronger, more determined and empathetic person. But it’s not these positive attributes that people would think of if they saw ‘history of mental illness’ on a job application.,My hope is that, in the future, the stigma of mental illness will not force young people to hide their strengths and talents for fear of what people might say or think about their mental health issues, but rather be proud of who they are and what they have achieved. I want others to see what I see when I look at Jess – not someone who suffers from mental illness, but a brave, determined young woman who I have no doubt will be a huge inspiration to many in the future. I am so very, very proud of her."
,"So I'm at a party and I'm doing okay. I've managed to overcome (well, disguise) my social ,long enough to engage in a nice, normal conversation with someone. ,Normal conversations are rare for me; usually, when I'm not forgetting to maintain eye contact and twitching like I'm on my eighteenth cup of coffee, I'm making uncomfortable jokes or babbling semi-incoherently or blurting out completely irrelevant and often inappropriate statements to try and cover up the fact that I actually have no idea what I am doing.,(Incidentally, I've found out that saying, 'Did you know that Victorians invented the first commercial disposable sanitary towel?' to cover up an awkward silence will actually make that silence even more awkward than it was before.),I am actually very, very good at ending conversations abruptly. I wish it were a legitimate superpower so I could wear a cape and go around fighting crime. I would call myself Awkward Girl, or perhaps The Conversation Killer. Oh god, I'm doing it again. See, this is exactly the kind of thing I'm talking about.,... and then it happens. The Alcohol Question,Anyway. For these reasons, being able to convince someone else that I'm a normal, functioning human being who isn't obsessed with superheroes or the history of feminine hygiene is quite a novelty for me. So I'm standing there feeling quite proud of myself, happily chatting away with my new friend, and then it happens: The Alcohol Question.,It has several forms, much like some sort of terrifying Lovecraftian elder god. There's the “What are you drinking?” form, the “Can I get you a drink?” form, the “Have you tried the sangria?” form, but the most terrible form of all is also its most direct: “Why aren't you drinking?”,alcohol makes me depressed,Isn't it rude to be so blunt? I used to think so but, then again, I also used to think that just talking at someone about Star Trek for half an hour was a perfectly acceptable way to socialise with them. Ten years and a good dose of social ostracisation later, I just tend to assume that I know nothing about how to interact with another human being and go from there.,The question tends to dry me up like a slug on the wrong side of a salt pot. So what usually happens is I stand there for a second going “Er... er...” and then I make up something about alcohol not agreeing with me, which is technically true because it sometimes agitates my irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).However, the main reason—and the very thing I don't want to say—is that alcohol makes me depressed.,the one thing that will always send my poor little brain into a five-day slump of enthusiastic self-hatred and irresponsible food choices is alcohol,My ,is a fickle thing. Lots of things can trigger it: the wrong food, too much food, too little food, too little exercise, thinking the wrong thoughts, reading the wrong books, days ending in “Y”. But none of these things are guaranteed to make me depressed every time. However, the one thing that will always send my poor little brain into a five-day slump of enthusiastic self-hatred and irresponsible food choices is alcohol.,I do not want to say this to my new friend, because the last thing I want to do is make them think I'm weird. And I am cagey about my , now. I used to be more open about them but that was before I experienced the bigotry of others first-hand. Now I stay quiet for the very reason that I should be talking.,instead of telling the truth... I avoid the issue,So I'm at a party and someone has just asked me why I'm not drinking. And instead of telling the truth—that alcohol is a depressive, that I suffer from depression and that the two things mix about as well as white cats and black leggings—I avoid the issue.,Then, of course, we get on to talking about my IBS. Let me point out that I never initiate this conversation. But people ask questions, and I answer them and my ability to change the subject becomes increasingly poor as I realise that we are actually talking about the activity of my bowels. I say this in an attempt to be funny. The conversation dries up. My new friend gives me that look. It is the look that says “that is a bit weird. You are weird”. It is the look that says “I am going to go soon”. And then they do. And I am left sipping my water looking awkward and wishing I were back at home with my cats.,Maybe it would be easier if I just told the truth."
,"I am 30, married and have a daughter who is almost two. Three weeks ago I stood up in a room full of friends & colleagues and tell them about an illness I had suffered from.

Knowing that I was suffering from ,was the first but most crucial step to being able to do something about it. I only knew about the symptoms of depression because somebody I worked with was brave enough to tell me about their experiences. ,Once I identified with these experiences it led to my diagnosis and the battle to beat the illness. Before then, I thought this was just what adult life was like and every one else just gets on with it. What’s wrong with me that I can’t? That’s the key point - there was something seriously wrong - this was not what adult life is supposed to be like!,this dramatic change in me ... compelled me to take action and make depression a subject that we are not afraid to talk about,I am happy to say that following a month off of work a year ago after my third and most serious bout of depression, I have recovered better than ever and am a stronger person for it. It is this dramatic change in me that has compelled me to take action and make depression a subject that we are not afraid to talk about either as a sufferer or a , member of someone who does.,I could not have spoken this openly about it right after coming back to work. In fact, my first day back, when I parked my car, it was in the space closest to the exit because I didn’t think I would make it in for fear of people asking me why I had been off for so long. What would I say? I couldn’t have told anyone then that I had been off for a month with depression. How would they react? What would they think of me? It is only a year down the line and four years since I was diagnosed by my doctor, that I am confident enough to speak openly about it.,I got involved in this documentary by replying to an advert I saw through Time to Change. I wanted to do it because, compelled as I was to do something to help, I didn’t know where to start. This opportunity came up and I thought it was a great way to use my experiences to try and help other people., I was surprised but happy to see a major broadcaster like Channel 4 tackle this serious issue, Initially I thought it would be for a smaller digital channel and I was surprised but happy to see a major broadcaster like Channel 4 tackle this serious issue. I hope a lot of people will learn from the whole week of programmes and will appreciate this subject that desperately needs to be de-mystified.,On the whole the experience of being involved with this documentary has been a positive one. After telling people of my own struggle with depression, others have talked to me about both their family members and even their own illness. It was a real help to me knowing that I was not the only one going through this and the more we talk about it the more I hope people who are suffering in silence - as I was - will be able to seek help.,I have been lucky enough to work for a company who have supported me,I have been lucky enough to work for a company who have supported me through this and after being open and honest with the people I work with, I don’t feel anyone has treated me differently.

,"Quite often, men find themselves reluctant to talk about their problems because they see it as a sign of weakness. I understand, because I've been there myself - but in reality it is just a stigma.,Although the true extent of my , only became apparent earlier this year, the signs have been there for a while.,For years I have isolated myself in my bedroom, curtains closed, ignoring the outside world and all the problems that came with it. I also found myself getting paranoid that people were talking about me, deliberately ignoring me or laughing at me. This led to me having several unnecessary confrontations with people.,Towards the end of last year, I met a girl who I was enjoying a close friendship with. We were texting each other constantly but when there was a break in texts I started to get paranoid that I had done something wrong and accused her of ignoring/hating me. The worst part was, a few hours after the argument, I was unable to properly remember what had happened. From then on, I was racked with crippling guilt and would apologise profusely until she forgave me. When these incidents became more frequent, it became clear that something was wrong.,One morning the realisation finally sunk in,One morning the realisation finally sunk in. After spending the night at a friend’s house, I woke up in unfamiliar surroundings which immediately made me uncomfortable. I lay in bed for a while, worrying about things that had happened during the week before and what could potentially happen in the coming the week. I had rehearsed every possible scenario in my head before focusing on the one that would potentially hurt me the most and then expecting that to happen.,All of a sudden I sat bolt upright and thought “I’m not myself – who am I?” like I had become a stranger. I settled back down and tried to reassure myself that I had nothing to worry about. I remember thinking; I’m Graham, I’m 27 years old, I have a good job, a successful part-time business venture, a loving family and great friends – but I’m not happy, why am I not happy?, I felt truly ashamed of myself – here I am, a 27 year old bloke, having to take pills just to make me feel normal,I went to see my doctor. After a few appointments, I was prescribed anti-depressants to stabilise my mood.  I felt truly ashamed of myself – here I am, a 27 year old bloke, having to take pills just to make me feel normal. I felt like I had let everyone down.,To begin with I suffered in silence with only my close family knowing the truth. Exhausted from sleepless nights and shackled by the stigma surrounding mental health, I felt weak and embarrassed to call myself a man.,When I told a friend that I was on anti-depressants, he replied with “what are you depressed about?” in a rather curt manner.,In this time, I told a handful of friends but there was an incident which stopped me in my tracks. When I told a friend that I was on anti-depressants, he replied with “what are you depressed about?” in a rather curt manner. This made me realise there is a distinct lack of understanding when it comes to mental health issues and made me apprehensive to open up to anyone else.,During this time, I lost one of my best friends to chronic rejection of the lungs and initially I found this difficult to deal with. Then a couple of days later, I came across the message he had sent me when I told him about my troubles, three words stood out – “don’t give up”.,I opened up about my troubles and tried to help other people as much as I could,From that day forward I decided to take inspiration from my friend’s passing. I opened up about my troubles and tried to help other people as much as I could. The first thing I did was contact my closest friends to inform them. Surprisingly I discovered that I had been blissfully unaware that quite a few of my friends who had been suffering from mental health problems. This provided me with a bit of extra support that I needed to fight back rather than hide away.,Later that week I made my , and published this on Facebook and Twitter. The support I received was unbelievable it made me realise that I am strong enough to fight my demons.,Since then, I’ve had a lot of good days and some really bad days,Since then, I’ve had a lot of good days and some really bad days. I still have the occasional sleepless night but not like before. I have rid myself of excess stress and repaired some of the friendships that I have damaged along the way. Seeing a therapist once a week has helped. It has made me learn more about who I am and why I have been feeling the way I do. It’s good to be able to unload for an hour and more often than not I leave with a clear mind.,I learned the true value of my family. Their love is worth more to me than any amount of money. I have also discovered who my true friends are and cannot thank them enough for sticking by me during the hard times. There is still a long way to go for me but talking, and especially writing, about my experiences has made all this a lot easier. Sometimes I just need a kind word or a hug to give me a lift. A text or a short phone call can make all the difference.,Recognising that you need help is a sign of strength not a sign of weakness,Recognising that you need help is a sign of strength not a sign of weakness. It makes you no less of a man in doing so. No matter how lonely you get or how hard life can be, someone will always listen to your problems. Just remember, you’re not alone."

,"I was diagnosed with clinical depression in my early teens. This was the 1980's. There wasn't much about in terms of treatment so I had monthly meetings with a 'psychiatric nurse' (what would be called a CPN today) during which she demonstrated her boredom and I learned not to tell her anything even slightly important.,I limped through a version of life in my teens and twenties that was bewildering and at times frightening. I had no idea how to control the hallucinations, depression and the instances of utter euphoria. As I grew older however I learned to source and pay for illegal drugs to try to control my symptoms. However I could do nothing about the hallucinations, both visual and auditory, that have never left me alone all through my life.,My thirties were better. I still had no clue that I had manic depression – I don't even think I'd heard of such a thing – but somehow I felt more settled.,However that settled feeling inevitably gave way to a very severe series of highs and lows that culminated with me getting a referral to see a psychiatrist. It was her who gave me the diagnosis of Bipolar I Disorder.,I am a Web Developer by trade. I have been for over ten years now. I started in a design studio in the West Midlands. I had several depressive episodes during the time I was there. At the time I had no idea I had manic depression. That would come 4 years later. In the meantime I was trying to hold on to my sanity and struggle to hold down a wage. When the dotcom bubble burst, I was laid off and sank into a long term depression.,I had the choice of telling my employer or of trying to battle through. I opted for telling them.,When I was eventually diagnosed four years after being laid off, I was working as an in-house designer for a large consultancy company in Birmingham. I had the choice of telling my employer or of trying to battle through. I opted for telling them. They were very good and offered support in the shape of time working from home and time off to see my CPN etc. ,Eventually though I left that job in 2009 as the result of a damaging (to both my career and friendships) manic episode.
2009 was also the year my then wife and I separated and eventually divorced. I relocated to Oxfordshire. Close enough to get to my kids and far enough away to start a new life. I met someone and we started a relationship. However, I was still going through my manic episode and I ended up being taken into hospital (with my agreement).,my new partner did not give up on me,However, my new partner did not give up on me. She visited me whenever she was allowed to. She took me in to the hospital and when I was discharged she took me home. I am now with someone who values me for me – manic depression and all – and I know even if I become ill she will not give up on me.,These days, I’m married to this same lady. I have also given up on permanent work and have become a freelancer and contractor. This enables me to organise my own time and if I need to, slow down for a while.,A large part of coming to terms with my bipolar was deciding what to do 
about and how to handle the stigma that comes with any diagnosis of 
mental illness.,A large part of coming to terms with my bipolar was deciding what to do about and how to handle the stigma that comes with any diagnosis of mental illness. How to manage other people’s misconceptions and beliefs is difficult - and it’s a shame that it’s necessary at all, but it is. ,Some of my friends felt very awkward after I told them I was ill. I was even dismissed by some people as being ‘faddy’ – they felt that because some celebs were claiming (rightly or wrongly) that they had bipolar that it was simply a rather pathetic plea for attention. Further, when I was ill, I lost friends who simply refused to engage with the idea of mental illness.,the set of people who have been most understanding and patient have been employers,Perversely, the set of people who have been most understanding and patient have been employers. Before I went freelance, I had told three different employers that I had manic depression. One during the time I was already employed and two at the interview stage. All three asked if there was anything they could do to accommodate any needs I might have. All three assured me they understood the ramifications of a period of illness. For one set of employers that didn’t turn out to be quite true but even they were supportive rather than damning.,I finally feel I have got used to my diagnosis. Looking back over the last 30 years of diagnosed and undiagnosed manic depression I blame my unmanaged disorder for my losing jobs, friends and relationships. However, I also know that I am what I am. The first step to accepting your own diagnosis and all it may entail is to challenge stigma, to be upfront about who and what you are and to accept that not everyone you meet will be able to handle the fact of your illness. But that’s their choice and their loss. "
"Matt, ","Depression. More than just a word. A very real, debilitating condition. I was diagnosed with it when I had just turned 16 and in truth knew very little about it. But it was through talking to people about how I was feeling that I came to be in the doctor's surgery being told that I had depression and referred to a counselling service. ,I will enter that very same doctor's surgery in a few weeks time to hopefully be told I no longer suffer from depression., is seen as something to be afraid of. People are afraid of the reactions they might get. I was in the fortunate position to have good people around me and a support network that I built up by talking out about my own mental health. ,It was when I began college that I suffered my most severe bouts of depression and it was then that I began to explore what it was and how I could bring myself out of this deep dark black hole, a journey which seemed to be an endless spiral into the depths of despair.,I stayed behind to discuss the problems that I had been having,Soon I concluded that for me to get better, my friends and teachers needed to know what I was going through. Fortunately I was on good terms with my form tutor who appeared sensitive and understanding. Indeed, this proved to be the case when one day I stayed behind to discuss the problems that I had been having. ,My tutor was happy to listen to me and not only that but encouraged me to seek support by actively inquiring as to what support was available throughout the college. It transpired that the only time I could get counselling was during tutor periods and, having discussed it with my tutor, I was able to take up this opportunity., felt the anxiety that had crippled me thus far at college,The first time I went to the room where counselling was, I walked past a handful of people waiting nearby, sitting on the floor. As I walked past them, I felt the anxiety that had crippled me thus far at college, as if they somehow knew what I was going in for, and were looking disapprovingly at me. Of course they weren't, how could they possibly have known? They couldn't have. ,The trouble is that's sometimes how people feel as a result of the stigma that manifests itself within of our society today.  However, those who mock us, who see mental health issues and mental illness as a weakness, are so very wrong. I am a stronger person for my depression because I talked about it to people, I managed to find the causes and the triggers and in turn managed to utilise the support I received to educate myself whilst improving my mood.,My experience of stigma has been both direct and indirect,My experience of stigma has been both direct and indirect: with friends whom I have got to know through support groups but also in the form of people using words such as ""schizo"" or phrases like ""I'm so sad I'm going to cut my wrists"" as a sarcastic response to something that has been said to them. ,This is stigma as much as people telling us to ""get over it"". However, I was told that I was a ""hater of life in general"" by someone who was supposed to be my friend and knew about my depression. Despite this affecting me at the time and making me feel like I was attention seeking or that I should keep my problems to myself, I persevered because I knew in my heart that the only way I was going to get better was by talking about it. ,Today, one of my favourite pieces of writing comes from Hamlet, the play by Shakespeare, with the famous soliloquy 'to be or not to be'. Hamlet is in a battle with his mind as to whether or not to live anymore. This, I feel documents the feelings many people go through with mental illness and certainly resonates with how I felt. I use it to remind myself that I was right to choose the option to be, to exist. We are all unique, special and contribute to society merely by existing.,We need folk to sit and listen to what we have to say,""We need folk to sit and listen to what we have to say, to try and understand what we are feeling, you cannot do that by treating the symptoms and ignoring the cause."" This quote sums up my experience with, and views towards the treatment of depression. ,I reached out to those who were willing to listen and try to understand what I felt and I will be eternally grateful to those friends who did this., ,Read Matt's blog ,and contact him on Twitter , "

,"It's hard to help people understand what’s going on inside your head when you have such a limited understanding of it yourself.,I have always tried to come up with analogies or examples to try and paint a picture for people when words fail me.

At one point in my late teens, my depression manifested itself in an all-consuming cycle of ‘get ready to go out; psych oneself up so much that the prospect of social interaction makes you shake and feel sick; accept defeat, send the cancellation text and crawl back into the safety of one’s bed’.,Trying to explain this to my friends was hard, and has not gotten any easier,This carried on for quite a while, and still occurs now (far less frequently, thankfully).

I have lashed out at friends and family more times than I can accurately recall; it’s only on , about writing as a means of coping with depression that I felt I should say something.,Don’t be mad at people when they don’t understand,Don’t be mad at people when they don’t understand. The fact that they have tried to understand is commendable in itself. And chances are they don’t see you as ‘that person with depression’. They see you as you; depression and all.

,"The first time I understood the true feelings of depression was when I was around 15 years old. I still remember sitting on my kitchen floor, feeling lost and hopeless with no clue what to do about it. All I wanted to do was shut myself away in my bedroom and ignore everything I didn’t want to deal with.,I’m now 33 years old. Over those years I never actually managed to treat or deal with my depression properly, only using my own tactics to ignore the issues and block them out as much as possible. I felt I couldn’t cope with the world, wasn’t normal, had to fake being ok and putting a false smile on my face to please others. Over the years it just seemed to become me and I lost track of the fact I was doing those things, it just became second nature.,I spent years and years at my parents shutting myself away, wasting my life away. At times there would be glimpses of things being a little easier, new relationships would bring joy and happiness temporarily but it felt like once I hit a stumbling block and the other person saw what I thought was the real me, I then felt weak and broken once again.,Time and time again I’d try to explain what was going on but would meet with the same old comments,Time and time again I’d try to explain what was going on but would meet with the same old comments: “Pull yourself together”, “Stop feeling sorry for yourself”, “I’ve got problems too you know” and “I can’t cope with you like this”. Those would come from family, friends, partners. Each time I would become so frustrated inside that nobody understood and would then turn it in on myself even more. ,What was wrong with me? Why was I not normal? What was broken inside my head? Every time I’d do the same process and have lost count of how many times I did. I’d convince myself that I could fix myself and then I’d just try to act normal, I’d act like I was ok, go out and get a job that I knew I didn’t want to do but would do it to appear like I was getting myself sorted. I’d act and be what people wanted me to be.,trying to be what I thought everyone needed and wanted,I spent so long adjusting and switching myself around trying to be what I thought everyone needed and wanted that I don’t know who I am anymore, and the depression has come back worse than ever anyway. ,I lost my dad nearly 2 years ago and it crippled me, the person who I could always rely on was gone and I had to face it all. I knew I’d hit the bottom because I could no longer use the same tactics to escape my depression and the issues which affect them. It feels like I shut all my emotions down and can’t feel a lot of the time. ,My son shines through it at times with a smile or a hug or other things, but the rest of the time I live in a fog watching other people seemingly living easier and happier lives than me. It was at this point that I was advised to see my doctor again.,I’m determined that I will get past this and that I will use my experiences to help others,As I type this today I have seen a very good doctor who made me feel at ease. I’ve decided to try some different anti-depressants  along with more counselling and am determined to work on the issues this time once I’m feeling better enough to do so. I know that I can no longer pretend or go back to my old habits but I see it as a good thing. This time around I’m determined that I will get past this and that I will use my experiences to help others. That in itself is a massive reason to keep going."

I may have suffered with depression before then.

On occasions I looked for other escape routes from the pain I was starting to find myself in.,My partner, no surprise, upped and left with my daughter. I basically encouraged her to leave almost as if to protect them from the person I had become and was relieved when this eventually happened. Although all the time I knew this was the last thing I wanted.

Although it had been suggested to me to do this before it was only at the final ultimatum that I actually looked for help. Via work I had access to counselling and it took two minutes to sort. I was lucky enough to see a councillor within a few days and within ten minutes of speaking to the councillor she suggested I get some medical help.,I was able to see a doctor very quickly and was on meds within a day. The meds were difficult for a few days but as they began to work.

Some friends find it very difficult to understand what depression means and someone at work said we all have things to deal with!,So what is the difference? Work have been very understanding and I am now able to manage myself to stay well.

,"If you're an Emmerdale fan, you will have recently seen Emmerdale's Zak Dingle struggling with his mental health problem. ,Our supporter, Lol Butterfield, talks about how he used his experiences to work with Time to Change to help Emmerdale craft their scripts.,------------------------------------------------------------------------,Performing an advisory role for the much loved character of Zak Dingle in Emmerdale is so different to anything I have ever done in my lifetime. This role has given me a unique opportunity to influence a major 'Soap' storyline with a view to challenging the all too common damaging myths and negative stereotypes surrounding mental ill health in the media.  ,Conversely in many ways this has been equally therapeutic for me as much as the character Zak himself. During the first few months of being a script adviser I found myself facing the prospect of redundancy at work, and whilst my self esteem and mood understandably dipped as a consequence of this news, my confidence began growing again in response to the advisory role I immersed myself into. For me, it’s important to get as near to accuracy as is possible with this work.,I felt it was crucial to concentrate as much on the non verbal as the verbal behaviour ,When reading through the scripts I felt it was crucial to concentrate as much on the non verbal as the verbal behaviour when giving feedback and advice to the programmes researcher. I felt this was critical to allowing the viewers to observe Zak’s despair by seeing his actions and behaviour as much as by hearing his words. Often the non verbal gestures and body language will betray a person’s inner feelings and highlight their depression. Small touches can be significant in telling the full story and I have tried to concentrate on minor details which all eventually build up a jigsaw to reveal the whole story.,My intention is also to encourage the viewers to fully empathise with both Zak and his wife Lisa, in her role as his carer. I also hoped that this would teach the viewers how to spot the potential signs and symptoms of depression in themselves and others.,I utilised the knowledge and experience of my 30 years work as a qualified mental health nurse,I utilised the knowledge and experience of my 30 years work as a qualified mental health nurse, and (of equal relevance), someone who has also experienced depression. My background knowledge of the hospital ward set-up, disciplines of staff, medication, documentation used, and treatment and recovery approaches is critical for realism. The communication skills of the staff, their non judgemental approaches, and therapeutic rapport with Zak should resonate with the viewer if I am to get this right. ,As such this work has become very personal to me. It comes from the heart as well as the head. In time, my working relationship with the Emmerdale researcher grew stronger through many telephone calls, emails, and texts discussing the character’s story. We both share a passion to make this work and make an impact for all the right reasons.,In essence I have tried to put myself in Zak’s shoes for this work,In essence I have tried to put myself in Zak’s shoes for this work. I have attempted to truly empathise with his plight in order to feel his pain and walk the same journey to eventual recovery. Only by doing this I believe I can be true to my profession, those who have found themselves on the receiving end of the mental health care system and the anti stigma cause itself. Although not everything has always gone my way in offering clinical and personal advice, I am reassured to say that much of my advice has been taken on board and Emmerdale are determined to sensitively promote this storyline, this enthuses me more. ,The viewers will ultimately decide for themselves of course, and I will continue to strive to make Zak’s condition and subsequent treatment as realistic and authentic as I can. My voice is only one voice but it comes as both the nurse and once the patient. That in itself must be a powerful influence and will strike a chord with the viewers.

,"Emails and text messages from friends and loved ones played a significant role when I struggled with my mood and mental health which eventually spiralled down into clinical depression. These are often regarded as small things but can make such a difference to someone who feels isolated and has lost the confidence to interact with others.,Confidence was something I had in abundance until my depression struck and then, as with most people, my confidence left me without warning. I was working as a mental health nurse at the time with a clinical caseload of clients with a range of mental health conditions. I suppose that was the irony of it all.,I would sit in my office and dread the ring of the telephone, or the knock on the  door. My confidence had all but deserted me. And yet with composure to answer my text messages, or the time to read an email, I would feel much better, more reassured. ,A simple text saying  ‘How are you?’ would make such a difference. It gave me the opportunity to respond in whatever way I wanted, it opened the door to communicating if I wanted to. Essentially it showed me that people care. ,Counselling, medication, and support all played their part in my recovery but it was a slow journey and  if I have a choice it is a journey I would not wish to make again. ,One of the most profound touches came in the form of a small ‘Get Well Soon’ card sent to me by a service user. It said ‘You were an angel to me when I was ill, I hope this goes some way to repaying this kindness’. It certainly did."
,"Here is a shocking secret. It’s stressful being a father of young children. ,Why is this a secret? Because we don’t talk about it. We should just man up and get on with it, shouldn’t we? We’re men, damn it. It’s our job to be stoically dependable at all times.,‘Reality check’, as Simon Cowell might say to a deluded talent show contestant. Dads with young children are often on an invisible treadmill of worry that’s pulling them inexorably towards a big, steaming vat full of stress. ,It’s Men’s Health Week and the headline statistics tells us 60% of British dads are out of shape. It’s not just our expanding middles that put us at risk of heart disease. Prolonged stress does us no favours either – and it has another, more sinister ally. Where stress lingers, depression is itching to get in on the action. It can quickly take you from being a chap who copes with all life throws at him to being someone who feels unable to cope with anything. That happened to me.,The worry starts when our partners are pregnant. We want to look after them and our unborn babies as best we can. Then there’s the worry and stress of the birth itself. I don’t need to be told that men have the easier deal when it comes to pregnancy and childbirth. Of course we can’t carry the child ourselves or give birth to it, but trust me, we can carry worry all too well, and very few people seem to care about that.,At the time when we most need support and understanding, dads are often ignored,At the time when we most need support and understanding, dads are often ignored, excluded, stereotyped and patronised, both during the pregnancy and after the birth. I regularly went with my wife to pregnancy check-ups, yet the midwife often seemed oblivious to my presence and rarely even said hello to me. Advice for new dads is usually little more than ‘Why not help your wife by doing the shopping?’ ,I once encountered an old lady as I was pushing my baby daughter in her buggy. “Doing your bit, are you?” she asked. Grr.,I don’t buy into pointless, petty, false divides and competition between men and women. We need to support each other. I don’t think anybody can be truly ready for the physical, emotional and mental demands of having children. You have to somehow develop limitless patience, the ability to keep going all day and all night on barely any sleep, and cope with the relentless screaming that goes with it.,You can’t underestimate the impact of constant tiredness and pressure on your mental health.,You can’t underestimate the impact of constant tiredness and pressure on your mental health. They affect your ability to think clearly, and that’s when other people’s ignorance and judgemental attitudes can really affect your wellbeing. You feel like you should be enjoying every magical moment of having children, then feel guilty when you don’t. The most placid or upbeat people get wound up and snappy when faced with sleep deprivation and a permanent assault on their senses.,But we feel like we need to keep soldiering on, proving that we are great husbands and dads, still the same indispensable employees we always have been. We keep our stresses and frustrations to ourselves, and can end up turning them in on ourselves, with devastating effects.,Some stress is inevitable, but relentless stress over several months or years is dangerous,Some stress is inevitable, but relentless stress over several months or years is dangerous. You can feel like a machine, existing purely to carry out a series of duties, all day and all night. Just as machines malfunction if they’re put under too much strain, so do human bodies, including your mind. ,I’d urge any parents to ask for support if they need it. Dads, don’t ‘man up’. Wise up. Don’t be too proud or too ashamed to accept help. I just kept going until I burned out. It doesn’t have to be that way.,I should just add that parenting is a uniquely wonderful experience – lovely, life-affirming, joyous and hilarious – just not all the time. Don’t be fooled by those permanently smiling super parents. You don’t know what’s going on in their heads… "
,"Statistics say one in four people will suffer mental health problems in any given year. To put that into perspective, that’s maybe half a dozen work colleagues, four members of your rugby team and a couple of close family members. And if you’ve got 200 friends on Facebook, well that’s fifty of them.,Yet how many people do you know who suffer? Unless you happen to work in mental health, I’ll guarantee it’s a lot less than that.,The reason for this is that most people choose to suffer in silence. They are afraid that others will perceive them as weak, or they’re ashamed and racked with guilt for feeling that way.,A lot of mental health problems have trauma as a starting point. Mine was in 2006 when my sister took her own life. I remember the phone call like it was yesterday. We were estranged at the time and guilt stemming from that took over my life and engulfed me.,I had my own construction firm, a great relationship and a good life- bit by bit the depression dismantled everything, and still I didn’t seek help.

I stopped answering the phone.,How could I, a six foot four eighteen stone ex-rugby player be so weak?,I was ashamed of myself for feeling the way I did, filled with guilt for letting everyone down and I felt worthless and less of a man. How could I, a six foot four eighteen stone ex-rugby player be so weak? I went to some dark places which four months later led me to attempt suicide.,Because I didn’t let anyone in and hardly nobody knew what had happened, I managed to brush it under the carpet and get on with my life without seeking the treatment I needed. After the inevitable second breakdown I started to get some clarity on the situation. I knew I needed to let people in to share my experiences.,I spoke about some of my experiences on Facebook,It started off as a self-preservation thing- I thought if it was out in the open and the people around me knew what I was going through, and were asking me about it, I would be compelled to get the help I needed. So after some soul-searching, I spoke about some of my experiences on Facebook.,The response was overwhelming- the support I received made me realise that mental illness isn’t something to be ashamed of and I didn’t need to suffer in silence.,friends who had mental health problems but had kept them to themselves shared their experiences with me,And unexpectedly, friends who had mental health problems but had kept them to themselves shared their experiences with me. A lot of friends. Which brings us full circle to the one in four. And I hope that those people that opened up found it as cathartic as I did. I have a long way to go, but I’m feeling positive about the future for the first time in a long time.,So please, if you know someone who is struggling, a kind word or a hug can go a long way. Don’t feel awkward or embarrassed about talking to us. And if you are suffering, you need to talk too. Open up to people. It’s hard to expose yourself mentally at first, but it’s the best thing I ever did."

I've also been told to 'man up,' 'stop feeling sorry for myself,' and even by one person – 'nah, you haven't got depression, you just think you have!',Over the years I've been called spineless, pathetic and lazy. I was also told at one workplace that I 'don't do anything.' I would have liked to see the person who said this to me drugged up on anti-depressants and drinking bottles of Lucozade just to be able to stay alert.

I then received a letter a few weeks later telling me, without any explanation, that I had been unsuccessful in my application and best wishes for the future.

And I'm not ashamed to say this because I understand mental health now. I know that whatever trouble a person with mental illness gets into - whether it's a suicide attempt, a horrible relationship break-up or a descent into drugs - it isn't a reflection on them, only their illness.

,"When anyone asks me why I gave up working for myself I tell them it was mainly the stress of having an unpredictable income and the sense of isolation that came from working on my own, which pretty much sums it up. ,I felt like the pressure and solitude was getting to me, so I got myself back into the world of employment before the stress became too much. I was really nervous about going back into the workplace but a steady income and social interaction was precisely what I needed. I was in for a horrible shock. ,The social isolation of self employment was tough but pales in comparison to the horror of working for a company with an aggressive, disrespectful culture. That was when ""mild stress"" became ""moderate depression and severe anxiety"".

I became paranoid, thinking everyone was talking about me. I eventually left, shattered, without a job to go to. ,I wasn't the only one. Staff turnover was a whopping 90%.

I particularly enjoyed working with the public but I also hoped to have some reasonable adjustments made under the then Disability Discrimination Act.,There was some consternation at the use of a long word beginning with “schizo”. My employer consulted an Occupational Health specialist.  This person never even met with me but recommended that I should be “assertively managed” and that my contact with the public should be limited. I ended up with a manager who shouted at me every time I looked up from my desk and spend most of my time filing in a back room.,Two of the most hurtful words in the dictionary: Schizophrenia and psychotic,When I was a kid, we used to say: “Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me”.  I have changed my mind.  Two of the most hurtful words in the dictionary: Schizophrenia and psychotic.  Those two words can ruin your life.,Time to Change is rightly concerned about the way people speak about mental illness.  Those of us diagnosed with psychotic illnesses must be particularly worried about those tabloid bogeymen, the “crazed gunman” and the “psycho killer”.  But I don’t mind being called “mad”. , I have a daughter, now in her early twenties.  She recently bought a horse, which she had been saving up for since she was ten years old.  She often rings me up to tell me how he’s getting on.  The other day she said: Mum, I put him out in the field today and he went mental!” Politically incorrect maybe, but I love her for being able to say it without worrying about hurting my feelings."
,"I wanted to write and talk about my experiences of depression and discrimination as a young adult. I started self harming when I was 16 and had recently started Sixth Form College. My parents were told and they were shocked and disgusted. I was punished for this and had my MP3 and my television taken off me. I was accused of being an attention seeker and this event ruined my A level grades.,After this I decided to take a gap year and became a youth worker. After considerable pressure my mood started to dip and I became very depressed. This was the first time I took an overdose and resulted in me being told to leave a position that I loved. I had to return to an unstable home where my behaviour and mood were misunderstood and I was told to “snap out of it”.  ,I carried on and went to university to study as a youth worker but again my mood dipped due to stress and I was asked to leave the course due to self harm. I was desperate to stay at university so I did what they said and didn’t challenge it and then transferred to study theology, which I quit after 3 years due to my lack of coping skills.,Discrimination is one of the most difficult things to challenge,Discrimination is one of the most difficult things to challenge. Sometimes I was treated like a child who had no control over my behaviour. My experience of suffering depression at university is that behaviour such as self harm or overdoses are seen as unacceptable due to the assumed risk to other people and the difficulties it may cause them. Of course we must be aware of how our behaviour affects other people but we need support and understanding too. ,After being removed from the youth work course I carried on doing youth work with a local organization where I knew the youth worker well. I love supporting and building relationships with all young people.,having had my own problems has made me a better youth worker,I feel that having had my own problems has made me a better youth worker as  I have a particular passion for working with young people who have difficult life situations. Even though I actively struggle with depression I can make a difference and don’t need to be wrapped in cotton wool.,keep trying and you can reach your goals,I’m now well on my way to going to university again but this time to become a mental health nurse now that my life is more under control. The point I want to make  to young people who have a mental health problem is don’t let discrimination control your life, keep trying and you can reach your goals., ,If you’re feeling in distress or need urgent support please find a ,., "
,"My counsellor first gave me the idea to write many years ago. I remember scoffing at the suggestion of starting a journal recalling my primary school days when I used to write awful banal nonsense about my summer holidays. ,Me, write? I didn’t think I could and certainly not about the thoughts swirling around my head. Having given it a try though, I can honestly say writing is one of the best tools I have in my battle against depression.,The big thing I’ve found about depression is that I want to tell someone about it. The problem with this is that people respond, both verbally and non-verbally. ,I appreciate people are only trying to help but I always felt that I was burdening them with my issue. Even professionals by their body language give off signals which, in my state of mind, I misinterpreted as disinterest in what I’m saying.,Paper doesn’t respond or react and so for me writing is the most pure way of getting my thoughts out of my head.,I was too scared to pick up the telephone,I first went to the doctors about my depression and anxiety 9 years ago. I had graduated the year before and was in my first proper job. And hating it. I didn’t even book the appointment myself, a friend had to do it because I was too scared to pick up the telephone.,I remember being incredibly nervous waiting and having half a mind to run away as I imagined the doctor would just laugh at me. The thought fought for space in my head with the knowledge that all was not well and that I had a problem which needed help.,I remember how self conscious I felt when I first tried writing an entry,My doctor was good as I explained what was wrong and was more than happy to put me in touch with an NHS counsellor. He also asked if I wanted some anti-depression medication. I turned them down as I was of the opinion that pills would be an easy way out and would camouflage rather than address the issues I was struggling with.,My counsellor was brilliant and we spent many sessions talking and coming up with coping strategies of which keeping a journal was one. I remember how self conscious I felt when I first tried writing an entry, how surprised I was at how vitriolic the thoughts were but pleased to know that I didn’t have to censor what I wrote unlike if I was talking with someone. ,Again the purity of it all was amazing and a great release of the pent up frustrations that I had been carrying around.,it became something I looked forward to on a daily basis even if I had no idea what I would write,As a result I felt a sense of relief for keeping a journal. From that moment, it became something I looked forward to on a daily basis even if I had no idea what I would write. ,There were times when the thoughts came so fast my hand could not write quick enough, times when I was crying so much I couldn’t see what I was writing. I even got worried that, once I’d started crying, I would not be able to stop. None of that mattered. What mattered was the poison was leaving my head, never to return.,I used to visit the counsellor on a Thursday mid-morning every couple of weeks. I’ve no idea what my employer thought I was doing, luckily he never asked me so I never told him. My own health was my number one priority., I have had episodes myself where writing didn’t seem to help., During this time I also learned other coping mechanisms, I was able to go to the supermarket again rather than order online as I had been doing. I was able to go out socially and not worry that everyone was staring at me and judging me.,I’m not naive and I know that depression and anxiety cannot be fought using just one technique. Although I advocate writing I know it may not work for some people. Indeed I have had episodes myself where writing didn’t seem to help.,I had to use different methods, including anti-depressives,So I had to use different methods, including anti-depressives on some occasions. I firmly believe the best way to fight is with a toolkit of different strategies.,Almost 10 years later, I now lead a more ‘normal’ life. I have had more episodes since then and I still maintain that I battle with both depression and anxiety. But I’m much more confident now, safe in the knowledge that, should I need them, I have the coping tools to fight., "

,I’ve heard them all; the absurd things that people say when they feel uneasy about something, when they are out of their comfort zone; when actually the best thing they could have done would be to have just listened.,Once I described to someone what it was like to suffer with depression they said with such flippancy ‘well we all have bad days’.  Very true, but the difference is that their bad days aren’t filled with dread, anxiety, dejection, hopelessness, fear and trepidation, to name but a few.,The hardest thing when living with a mental illness is coping with loneliness,The hardest thing when living with a , is coping with loneliness. It feels like you’re living under a black cloud, deep inside a fog that at times can suffocate you.  ,You can become so alone in a world brimming with people.  In the darkest of those times all I ever need is company, someone who will listen, someone who can offer words of comfort, or someone who will just sit with me until the bad time passes.  If I’m alone, the bad time doesn’t pass quite so quickly and it becomes unbearable.,I very openly discuss my illness,I very openly discuss my illness with whoever wants to listen, some take it in and try to understand, but others, they turn a blind eye not wanting to know.  The unfortunate thing is that it can happen to anyone at any point in life and I often think if it happened to them wouldn’t they want someone to listen, someone to care.,I have recently being diagnosed with ,, something which involves a degree of instability in self-image and identity, black and white thinking, highly emotional behaviour and impulsivity.  My initial thought that day was ‘great, another label’.  However, the more I learnt about it the more I realised that this isn’t just a label it’s so much more.  It’s who I am and who I’ve been for some time; it’s the only way I know how to be.,if it were to be brushed under the carpet and ignored the consequences would be dire,The thought of hours of therapy that the future holds is a frightening prospect. Even more frightening than this is knowing that I will have to completely change the person I am in order to become well. That’s not going to be easy but it has to be done because if it were to be brushed under the carpet and ignored the consequences would be dire.,A lot of the time I’m completely misunderstood.  I might be over sensitive, cautious and lack self worth but what people don’t understand is why.  If they knew the daily or even hourly battle I had to fight maybe they wouldn’t question who I was but more how they could help, how they could make a difference.,the world would actually be a better place if more people simply understood you,Sometimes depression can leave you feeling that the world would be a better place without you in it, that’s not true; the world would actually be a better place if more people simply understood you. ,I have had so much support from so many people without which I wouldn’t have survived.  So many people have shown such compassion and understanding and have supported me during my times of suffering.  ,They have sat with me in my darkest hours and have got me through each and every time.  They have never left my side, and have done so with such patience. To have them in my life has been nothing short of a blessing."
,"I was diagnosed as bi-polar last summer following a final breakdown - although it transpires I have probably had it since my late teens, early twenties. The one thing that surprised me was how my whole life suddenly made sense and everything dropped into place.,It answered so many questions about the person I had been and some of the decisions I had made throughout my life. ,Of course with it came some regrets as some of the decisions I made affected the rest of my life in one form or another and not all for the better. But at least now I have a better understanding about why I probably made those decisions.,I pushed people away from me including family. I did things that appalled them but in my mind it was all their fault and not mine. I had periods of depression which in the early days neither I nor anyone else recognised as such – albeit now so glaringly obvious. ,I have likened it to walking along a cliff: most days I was on top happy and enjoying life but then I fall off the cliff and life became darker and more miserable. I would spend days hating myself and wondering why everybody around me was so damn happy and what was it that made them feel like that. Why couldn’t I be like that all the while I was struggling to climb back up the cliff – of course when I got to the top all was fine with the world again until the next time.,my wife had seen something coming and had only that week spoken to my GP about me,The crunch finally came in July last year – when I hit the bottom like never before locking myself in the spare room armed with alcohol and very dark thoughts. I had decided I wanted to be alone and to that end I had pushed my whole family away including my wife. I was hell-bent on leaving her, blaming her for all that I thought was bad in my life. ,I had turned into a cruel and horrible person – unbeknown to me my wife had seen something coming and had only that week spoken to my GP about me. After hours of torture with my wife sat outside the door pleading with me to come out I finally emerged drunk and tearful.,I started to piece together my life,The next day I was say in my GP’s office pouring out the whole sorry story. He was incredibly supportive and still is, by his own admission he is no mental health expert. He recognised the symptoms and referred me to my local mental health clinic – started me on medication and so I started to piece together my life.,It was a long haul, two months off work but manageable with the unbelievable support from my wife and my GP – he insisted I saw him at least once a week and if I didn’t make an appointment he would ring me and make me come in to see him.,The day arrived when I had to go back to work,The day arrived when I had to go back to work and I made the decision to send an email out to my department of 100+ people including managers and supervisors explaining why I had been off for so long. The reaction was mixed but in the main a good reaction in face a number of people emailed me back congratulating me on being brave in being so open about being Bi-polar.,From my point of view it set a level playing field, no whispering in corners, no speculation or distorted facts about why I was off. If anyone wanted to ask me about my condition they were welcome to ask me and to this day people still are – often asking how I am, recognising when I am having a bad day and being generally supportive.,I consider myself very fortunate to have an understanding employer, colleagues and above all else wife and kids,Having read some of the experiences on here I consider myself very fortunate to have an understanding employer, colleagues and above all else wife and kids.

,"I have struggled and battled with depression, for several years - albeit unbeknown to me. I took to drink to disguise what I was feeling inside.,I went down this path for many years - from the age of 17 until I was around 30. I am surprised that I am still alive.,Last year - 2011 was a turbulent year for me - I was under immense pressure from work. My boss did not listen to me when I kept asking for help but alas because I was deemed a 'success' and I was busting sales targets he did not listen.,This resulted in me trying to take my own life in February 2011 - and a stay in a secure hospital.,The support of my wife has helped me. This was difficult for her initially as she did not truly understand what I was going through as I was very good at hiding my feelings - I am a salesman and so waffling comes naturally to me. It wasn't until I was admitted to hospital that it truly hit home to her how ill I was.The hardest time for me was seeing her on my first day of admission and telling her I needed help - she couldn’t understand why as she saw me as a happy-go-lucky kind of guy.,I was under quite a lot of pressure from work,With the support of my wife I was eventually allowed longer leave and went home full time - under the care of the Crisis Team. I have to mention at this time that I was under quite a lot of pressure from work - I was getting phone calls in hospital and questions on when I would return to work. However my wife spoke to me and explained that I was ill but I was so desperate to please my boss and get back to work that I started to totally focus on totally returning to work. So after 13 weeks off I was signed back on a 'phased return'. ,My wife was not happy with this but as I assured her I was ready (I really was not). She let me speak to my Doctor and discuss returning back to work. So after 13 weeks off I was signed back on a 'phased return'. However, this did not happen and I was soon driving to different parts of the company helping out poor performing areas of the business. I was so pleased to be back that initially I did not worry too much.,It was only after a few weeks when my wife pointed out that I was doing 10 - 12hour days that I realised I was exhausted. I approached my boss who was unresponsive so I had to get in touch with human resources who tried to help. This annoyed my boss.,Eventually after a few months this role took its toll on me, I aired my concerns and to cut a long story short I was told to attend a review meeting, where I met with my boss and one of his colleagues.,He again told me that I was a problem ,He again told me that I was a problem and told me to go home and find a job - either in or outside of the company.,My wife at this point was again very supportive and helped me through this.,My boss then sent me to an independent medical assessment to check on my health - the doctor there was so concerned about my health that he made me an appointment to see my Doctor - he was concerned that i was under so much work related stress, which was also adding to my depression. I duly went to my Doctor who signed me off for 2 weeks - when I told my employer this I was told that I would not get full company sick pay as I was not contractually obliged to it.,My wife was again in turmoil but this time she understood a little more,This took its toll on me and I tried to take my life again - I was prevented by the Police. I was again admitted to the hospital - my wife was again in turmoil but this time she understood a little more.,I must also say that I understood why I had been admitted - this made the experience a little easier.,I was again in for around two weeks - but the visits from my wife were much more constructive. She also took control of work and made them understand that the reason why I was in hospital was down to them - they then changed their mind and offered me full company sick pay.,My boss wanted to meet. My wife took the bull by the horns and was also at the meeting which we held at home. She dealt with him, did the negotiating and made sure I understood what was going on.,She is still doing this as we have had two more meeting up to this point - we have another at the end of March, which I believe will decide my future.,I will either be offered a different role or will keep the same role in the Lincolnshire area - with reasonable adjustments - my boss is not too keen on this.,So, I do not know what the future holds for me, but I do know that I have really appreciated the support of my wife., "
,"I have spent the last decade of my working life trying to prove that I am not a failure and trying not to admit that I might be, by forcing myself to keep quiet about my depression.  The Time to Change project has made me think about this a lot, raised questions within me and forced me to confront my own contribution to stigma.   I am talking primarily about the stigma towards mental health in the workplace.  I have suffered massively from this in my career and yet I wonder now if I have also contributed to it by staying quiet?,It’s not easy to portray yourself as a success every day.  And while most people have setbacks, miss deadlines ormeetings that don’t go so well, when they go home after a less than perfect day at work they don’t beat themselves up as hard as I do.  I convince myself that I have not performed well enough, that I have failed.  And I add that to my bag of ‘failings’ that seems to get fuller and fuller the more depressed I get.,Would most people really judge me if I was open about my depression?,Sometimes I can last months like this, trying all the time to achieve perfection at work.  What I’m really doing is trying to not let my colleagues see that a) sometimes I’m not perfect and b) sometimes I don’t like myself and c) I suffer from depression.  So I pretend depression doesn’t exist and I protect it to a point where I can’t cope.  Would most people really judge me if I was open about my depression? I don’t know the honest answer to that.  In a perfect world I would like to think they wouldn’t but in my world, they have.  ,The times when I have discussed this with my employers I have been met with an attitude which makes me sick to my stomach.  Not once have I been offered help without really having to humiliate myself and beg for it.  In all instances this has lead to my entire workplace knowing I ‘can’t cope’ and has resulted in a deep shame that has further taught me to keep quiet.,I resigned from my position. I was so angry at the way I was treated,We take it for granted that a manager can assess an employee with a bout of flu and respond accordingly but responding accordingly to an employee that has stress or an illness related to stress is far from the capability of most managers in most businesses. ‘This is a business at the end of the day and we need you to be there giving 100%, if you can’t give that then we will have to look elsewhere’. This was the comment passed to me by my last employer following a about of glandular fever I had which sparked a period of depression for me. , After it was pointed out that my absences due to sickness were being tracked and ‘appeared to be following a pattern’ (which I assume is some sort of threat) I resigned from my position.  I was so angry at the way I was treated because as proved later by a glowing reference, I had been over performing and doing a brilliant job.,In my particular case I requested help several times via phone and email and in person, I even suggested solutions (reduced work load etc.) but this was ignored and I was described to other employees as being ‘frantic and out of control’.  Did I contact disability rights and agencies there to assist with this type of discrimination? Yes and to no avail, the ground work in calling, writing, researching my rights and carefully putting them across to my employer was too much for me in my depressive state. , So I gave up, especially after they contacted a lawyer and sent me a document to sign which made me waive all my rights in order to be paid the money owed to me for my notice period.  Yes, this happens in this day and age and it’s wrong.,So where do I find myself now? Unemployed, yes. Burnt for having spoken up in the workplace? Yes. But I find myself changed in greater ways.,So where do I find myself now? Unemployed, yes.  Burnt for having spoken up in the workplace? Yes.  But I find myself changed in greater ways.  I find myself admitting that I have contributed to the stigma by keeping quiet and challenging myself to confront that in the future. I think the biggest difference I can make now is to speak up and to search for a job in a company that understands mental illness and workplace discrimination. ,In a time of high unemployment I can’t promise this will happen but I have to believe it is possible.  The reality is that there are thousands of people like me who can do an excellent job at work and who go above and beyond to prove that they are not useless because they are fighting against their feelings of depression.  ,What they need is a safe space to say they are not coping and a rational response which is ‘how can we help?’ because with a little bit of help and less judgement they can help.  They can tell you that you’re doing a great job, that not everything has to be brilliant and that you are meeting their expectations.  Re-structuring workload and work hours can seriously help to get a person back on track.,I have assisted dozens of employees through mental health burn outs and got them back on track,How do I know this? Because throughout the last decade of my working life, ironically, I have also been the manager at the coal face and this is exactly what I have said to numerous employees that have spoken up to me.  I have assisted dozens of employees through mental health burn outs and got them back on track.  It was when this response was not given to me that I became frustrated and angry.  I take my hat off to those that speak up and I treat them with the kindness and respect they deserve., "
,"""I’m alone"", ""It would be better if I was dead then I won’t be a burden”, “People won’t believe me if I say I’m depressed, that my smile is fake”. To a depression sufferer like Frankie Sanford these comments are on a constant torturous loop.,Recently ,. Speaking to Glamour magazine she truly depicts her battle with the illness, extending to hospitalization in October last year. We all may think that pop stars have the ideal lifestyle but anyone can be struck by depression, anxiety and stress as the article expresses her darkest emotions and thoughts of depression that crippled her everyday life.,Frankie’s story highlights the importance of speaking up about mental illnesses. That everyone has mental health and to struggle with depressive thoughts on your own can just make life extremely difficult. Why should people feel ashamed of an illness? Would it be the same for a broken bone? Or for diabetes? People should be respected for who they are with or without an illness. What I found most harrowing about the article was the intrusion of the British press to leak the story in breach of the privacy of Frankie. She, like many other sufferers should be encouraged to speak openly about their struggles if and when they are ready not when they pressurised to do so.,Her openness about how “debilitating” the illness became makes for poignant reading. How she became so unhappy that she would retreat back to bed as she couldn’t face living. People with depression are characterised by low mood, suicidal thoughts, negative self-image and feelings of worthlessness and inadequacy. With these symptoms it is understandable how life becomes unbearable. Therefore it is crucial for sufferers to receive help as quickly as possible before the isolation and symptoms increase severely. Frankie is lucky she sought help for depression but even this was staggered, as she reveals her battle began at just 15. If we promote awareness of mental health and the message that it is ok to talk openly about mental health then the likelihood of people seeking help sooner will increase.,The “Time to change” campaign, run by Rethink Mental Illness and Mind, promotes the need for the public to change perceptions and reactions to mental illnesses. I think Frankie’s depression emphasises the fact that we are all human as she says “I try not to put pressure on myself – it’s unrealistic, no one is 100% happy all of the time.” Here she acknowledges that it is ok not to be ok to be comfortable in what you feel despite the depression telling you otherwise. Also there shouldn’t be shame or doubt in saying “I suffer from a mental illness” as it shouldn’t be an awkward subject that needs to be avoided like the plague. To ultimately realise that mental illnesses are as common as physical illnesses., ,Or find out ,., "
,"I’ve read a number of inspiring articles featured in the Time to Change campaign, and I wanted to contribute my own story. ,I think it’s fantastic that so many people are coming out and being honest about their own struggles (and successes) with their mental health. By doing so, they are certainly helping to break down the dogged stigma that endures.,I first experienced depression a decade ago, at the end of my first year of university. It has continued to follow me around and ensnare me at various points in the years in between then and now. ,When I have been in the midst of depression’s painful grasp, full of dark thoughts and self-loathing, I would have done anything to feel positive again and break its grip. However, when feeling well and ‘normal,’ as I am now, I would probably choose not to change any of my experiences.,I feel like depression, as negative as it makes me feel, has ultimately been a force for good.,My depression has been a big part of my life as an adult and has taught me many valuable lessons that I might not otherwise have learnt. I feel like depression, as negative as it makes me feel, has ultimately been a force for good. It has made me re-evaluate my life and look to live with more balance and try to do things that will make me happy.,As an example, I could cite the work I used to do, which made me feel very unfulfilled and unrewarded, and was often accompanied by bouts of depression that lasted for weeks on end. Some bouts I managed to ride out, others I had to take time off sick. But ultimately, if it was not for the depression and feeling that something was very wrong with my life, I think perhaps I would never have had the motivation to leave and look for a more suitable career. ,In my view, stigma towards mental illness like depression and anxiety, is born of ignorance and, as such, is very hard to eradicate. I have felt so frustrated when told to ‘keep my chin up’ and ‘just move on’ by people who, by means of pure chance, have no idea how incredibly mentally painful and debilitating depression feels.,It’s certainly as far removed from a having a bad day or a bad mood as are the North and South poles!,I can guarantee that, if they did, they wouldn’t say such things and would hold back their opinions on the subject. What I really feel is that more people (some undoubtedly are already) should be open-minded and respectful enough to accept that depression exists, is a real illness with real symptoms, and deserves just as much sympathy and resources as any other physical illness. Just because someone doesn’t experience mental ill health doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist for others and is all ‘in our heads’. It’s certainly as far removed from a having a bad day or a bad mood as are the North and South poles!,I do try to be open about my mental health problems, but I am also cautious to not let it rule my life and, as a friend advised, ‘not to let depression define you.’ I try to talk to people at the right time and in the right way, not out of a need for pity, but because I want to be honest and because talking definitely helps.,I’m deeply afraid of it returning,I have taken medication and had Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, both of which have undoubtedly helped. I have not had a bout of depression for 18 months, and I am confident that, as long as I lead a balanced and healthy lifestyle, there is no reason why depression should return. ,Of course it might, nothing is certain, and, if I’m honest, I’m deeply afraid of it returning – it seems to me that it gets worse with every episode.  However, I am very optimistic and have learnt valuable coping strategies like a daily practice of yoga and meditation, as well as regular jogging and a healthy diet, that are helping to keep my negativity at bay.,It is a hell of a battle but one that I am happy to be winning,I am determined to beat depression and, as much as possible, help others who are suffering. In my experience depression, however painful it feels and however convinced I am that it is here to stay, always lifts to reveal the light and mark the return of positive thinking. It is a hell of a battle but one that I am happy to be winning. , "

However as the booze sank in my emotions, or rather lack of them, came to the forefront and the phrase ""the lights are on but nobody is home,"" sprang to mind as I continued my rambling vacuous speaking to friends and people I had never met before. Call it hidden, bottled and tucked away raw emotions, development of acute anxiety, developing dangerous negative thought processes and insularity, but whatever it was, I went home at 6AM that night and self-harmed myself before turning in.,After a couple of days nursing a hangover and living in an emotionless fog, I eventually sought help, first through talking to a close friend of mine in intimate surroundings where we wouldn't be distrubed and also to my mum. They recommended a chat with my GP and I eventually saw him last week. It helped that I had known him since childhood, and although no doubt he was a busy man, he took the time to list, without prejudice and with genuine concern, whilst being calm and making me feel at ease.,To sum up, I have been diagnosed with mild to moderate depression and today I sent forms off requesting counselling sessions which will involve cognitive behavioural therapy. I still haven't got to the nub of the problem properly yet but recently I know I have been very stubborn, set in my ways, formulaic and at times cold, quiet and aloof. ,What this self-help and hopeful recovery will do is give me a proverbial kick up the backside, change my thought processes, and be more assertive, confident and give me a new purpose and direction in life, breaking me kicking and screaming out of my comfort zone ,The ironic thing is that everyone knows and says I am a lovely, humourous and loving individiaul but sometimes I don't know it myself, and I need to rediscover and re-evaluate my positive atrributes to make life easier and managable again. I am my own man and if people can't change me that's their fault, not mine. And if anyone ever tells to ""man up"" (one of my most hated buzz-phrases which makes me cringe), they will earn a stiff but gentle rebuke from the new positive and assertive me!,Rambling over.

This commitment helps us to edge a little further towards the tipping point where mental illness is no longer considered a taboo. Six thousand people work in the building where I was speaking. Some of them will already have mental health conditions. In such a stressful world, others may develop them. It was heartening to see such a big company taking these issues, and the wellbeing of staff so seriously. I hope other similarly sized firms in the financial centre of London will follow suit.,One in four of us will experience a mental illness in some shape or form and in a perfect world this should not affect our employability. However, sadly, mental health stigma still exists in workplaces so the support from Ernst & Young is valuable. As the Time to Change ‘World Without’ report asks, what would our world be like without historical leaders such as Churchill, Lincoln, Darwin, Marie Curie and Florence Nightingale - all had what today would be mental health problems.,My personal experience with mental health problems is no secret. I still have bouts of depression but I have help and support to come through these difficult episodes. In 1986 I had a major psychotic breakdown where I experienced voices, paranoia and I was eventually arrested and admitted to hospital for my own safety. As I said to the Ernst and Young meeting, it was the worst experience of my life at the time, but looking back it was the best thing that ever happened to me. I sorted out my priorities and am now better equipped with a good yardstick to deal with pressure and stressful situations.,When I moved over from journalism to politics I had no choice but to be open about my illness, because one or two papers wrote about it, and I never regretted it. For now I have accepted that this is a part of me and something that I can manage. One great form of therapy was writing my novel about mental illness, All in the Mind, and more recently an ebook on the political and personal pursuit of happiness, ‘The Happy Depressive’. People are kind enough to say it helps them when people with a public profile talk about these things. In truth it helps me too. 
I have been lucky in the workplace and to be fair to the media, on this part of my life they have been pretty good. But others really are not so lucky. They fear that if they admit a problem past or present it will be held against them, and job opportunities will vanish. ,Mental health really is the last taboo. We look back at times when black people couldn't vote, when women couldn’t wear trousers in the workplace, when gay people couldn’t be honest about their sexuality - this all seems totally unacceptable now. It took time and it took the courage of campaigners to break down those taboos. Now we all of us have to work at breaking down the taboo of mental illness. We all have physical health. Some days it is good. Some days it is less good. It is the same with mental health and we would all be better off if we admitted that. 
I hope that I can look back during my life time and people of the next generation will ask ‘Why were people so scared of being open about our mental illnesses?”; “Did employers really say they would not recruit someone who admitted they took medication for depression?”; “Did we really used to think that people who have schizophrenia were all violent?”; Did people with lived experience of mental health problems really say that the stigma and taboo was sometimes worse than the symptoms of their illness?”. And last but not least “Did we really used to write off some of the brightest and best in our country because they carried a label marked mental illness?”,So many thanks to Ernst and Young for signing up to Time to Change. And come on other firms and organisations - big or small - join Time to Change and pledge to end mental health discrimination. This is a battle we can win. But it takes people to see that it matters, and want to make it happen. , ,Or find out ,., ,This blog was originally published on ,., "
,"One of the hardest conversations I’ve ever had to have came when I decided I had to tell one of my best friends about my battle with depression. , The first day I settled on telling her, I couldn’t.  I had built myself up, all ready to state the fact, and then to answer the questions that I knew would come later. ,  As she was training to be a youth worker, I was fairly sure that she’d understand, be non-judging and supportive while also inquisitive.,You all know how the conversation goes:
,Me: “Hello”
,Her: “Hi”
,Me: “How are you?”
,Her: “OK, you?”
,Me: “only OK?”
,Her: “... someone who used to go to my parents’ church killed himself” ... erm, right.  Not what I expected to hear.,It’s about choosing who you tell, when. And how.,How can you tell someone that you suffer from depression after that?  It’s hardly the right time.  Sometimes it’s a balancing act of trying to decide when to be selfish enough to share your burdens with someone, and when they have quite enough on their plate right now already.  It’s about choosing who you tell, when. And how.  ,I ended up telling this particular friend the next day, because she sensed that I wanted to tell her something.  When I told her that I had been struggling with it for a few years, her response was “how come you never told me? ... I’m picking up on stuff that makes sense now ... I’m sorry”., I find that people really don’t know what to say,The fact that she felt that she had to apologise for not realising that I was not coping made me feel even worse.  I find that people really don’t know what to say, and as a result, I’ve only told 8 people (other than the GP) about how tough I find life sometimes.  The reactions I’ve had have varied between “I knew it!” to just a brush off.   It’s difficult to predict, and I am well aware that this is why the number of people who know about my struggle is quite low. ,As I go through the ups and downs, I often wonder if sharing my diagnosis with others would be a good idea.  It’s usually as I start to go into a low point, or come out of one, that I most want to tell people, because that’s the stage at which I am able to know that I need support.  But then I encounter the bit that I find most difficult: approaching the subject in the first place.,In continental Europe, people seem to be fairly open about their depression,As a student studying abroad for a year, I am removed from my usual support network, have the added stress of trying to deal with studies in a different language and trying to work out a different culture and the cultural perceptions around mental illness.  In continental Europe, people seem to be fairly open about their depression.  When people ask “How are you?” it is sincerely meant, and is an invitation to actually say how you are, unlike in Britain, where the ‘correct’ answer is “oh, I’m fine/alright/well thank you, how are you?”.  ,How do you “come out” to those people who you care about, and who care about you?  When is the “right time”?,I certainly don’t have all the answers.  I have very few.  But I hope that when I find the right time, and the right words, the people I tell will have the right attitudes., "
,"I want to say a big thank you to Frankie from the Saturday’s for ,. It is always hard for anyone to open up about any issues they may be experiencing relating to their mental health. I feel that this is very strongly linked to the stigma surrounding it.,I am of the age where I was a big fan of S Club 7 and because I was of similar age, it was very exciting for me that the group S Club Juniors were formed and this is where I first knew of Frankie. The S Club 7’s concert where S Club Juniors were supporting was the first concert I had ever been to! Then when the Saturday’s appeared in the music scene it was like a blast from my younger years! Any way; before I get too carried away reminiscing, what I want to point out is that Frankie is known for being in S Club Juniors (later renamed S Club 8) and more recently The Saturday’s. So she is quite a role model and known by the younger generations especially.,What I feel is so admirable about Frankie is that she is so young and a role model for many young people. At only 23 and admitting that she has struggled from the age of 15, will be such a help to many younger people who struggle with their mental health. Being a young person myself, I know and have experience of how hard it is to speak out. There is a lack of knowledge and understanding among young people and I think the stigma among this age group is stupidly high. The pressures of needing to fit in at school, college, uni don’t allow room for people to become ill mentally. Physically, yes. This is a lot more acceptable because you can see that an individual is not well and it is easy to understand this. Do you see people sending ‘Get Well Soon’ cards to people who become mentally ill? It is an incredibly hard life for a young person even without having the extra baggage of having to cope with poor mental health and the stigma attached to it. That is why it is even more promising to hear that Frankie’s story is going to be the launch of ,!,I personally can relate so closely to the situation that Frankie describes, about getting upset because her boyfriend had ,. There have been several occasions where I have broken down in tears because we didn’t have any yoghurts in the house, or even simply the wrong yoghurts. I remember one time, when I was in Australia, visiting family, where I got really distraught because I could not find anywhere that sold toffee flavoured yoghurts and I needed toffee yoghurts not vanilla or strawberry or any other flavour. Just toffee! It’s bizarre how something like that can create such an emotional response and how this emotional response can be misinterpreted or misunderstood by people who witness it thinking that you’re just a selfish, spoilt brat (or something along those lines) it isn’t the first thought that comes to mind that someone irrationally reacting in this way may in fact have something not quite right with their mental health. It is brilliant to hear that Frankie has had a lot of support and therapy to help her and also come to terms with being ill with this horrible debilitating illness that is depression. In a selfish way this somewhat upsets me and makes me envious that she is famous, because it means that she has much easier access to the help that is needed. Whereas for the general public and myself included, it can often be an ongoing battle and near impossible to access the help and support that is needed which just adds to the stress and anxiety. To get an admission to hospital it feels that you have to do something very drastic in order for that to happen. But I won’t go into this and get carried away with it because that is a whole other story.,What is so brilliant about a celebrity speaking out about mental health is that it brings the issue to the front of people’s minds. Makes people more aware that anyone can suffer with poor mental health. I think it also helps people to talk about it and maybe share that they struggle themselves. People like Frankie speaking out about mental health aids campaigns like Time to Change in their aim of tackling stigma and discrimination on the grounds of mental health. This is why I want to thank Frankie for ‘coming out’ as some would say, about her struggles with depression and to also acknowledge that it is a hard thing for anyone to do, especially for anyone that is in the ‘lime light’., ,Or find out ,., "
,"
I suffered for many years with severe post natal depression; I only started to feel like me again after about seven years. My son is now 11 and we have a wonderful relationship. I know I am a good mum and am proud of what I have achieved. Throughout it all my husband has been my rock and I owe my life and my strength to him.,
It all started in October 2000 when I gave birth to a wonderful baby boy, the son my husband and I had wanted so much. I didn't find the pregnancy the joy I had thought it would be and the birth was a living nightmare.,
I loved my son with all my heart from the moment I set eyes on him, but from pretty much the first few seconds of his life I felt a complete failure, I felt that he deserved a far better mother than me. I hadn't even given birth properly and ended up having a caesarian section. When I struggled to get to grips with breastfeeding this just confirmed for me that I was not good enough.,
The next few weeks became a blur of tears and darkness as I struggled through and tried to pretend everything was okay.,
Why did I feel like this? What was wrong with me? My son was perfect, my family was complete, why was this happening? I didn't even recognise myself anymore. I felt so lonely; my husband was in the army and we were living in Northern Ireland. I had no family and friends around me and longed for people to come and fuss over me and my baby, but no one was there.,
Eventually I knew I couldn't carry on so I went to see the GP, he was brilliant and gave me a huge cuddle. I'll never forget his kindness, he helped me understand it wasn't my fault and that I was ill. I was diagnosed with severe post natal depression. The GP wanted to hospitalise me but I couldn't bear the thought of it so I ended up leaving Northern Ireland and going to live with my mum until my husband and I could find a new home.,
Back in England I tried to put on a false smile and pretend everything was wonderful, that's how it's supposed to be isn't it? On top of how I was already feeling I missed my husband so much it hurt terribly and I felt guilty for leaving him behind and separating him from our son - another confirmation that I was a terrible mum.,
Over the coming months I struggled through but at times it all became too much to bear and I hurt myself in any way I could think, biting myself, hitting myself, calling myself awful names and spending hours imagining how I would end it all.,
I don't really think I wanted to die; I wanted to see my son grow up. It all just felt so helpless and I couldn't see any way out. I thought my husband and son would be better off without me.,
The hardest thing of all was the fear of people knowing I had a mental illness. I worried social services would take my son away; I was an early years worker and worried that I'd never get a job again. I also knew that friends and family didn't understand what was happening to me, I'm sure some of them didn't even believe I was ill. I distanced myself from everyone I loved and this just made things feel even more hopeless. I hated being told to 'pull myself together'; did people really think that I had chosen to feel this way; that I wanted to be like this? I'll never forget visiting my new GP back in England; I was in tears and feeling at an all time low. He told me to 'stop being silly'. To this day I still don't know how I stopped myself from ending it all that night. If a doctor thought I was just being silly, then it must be all my fault. Why couldn't I make it go away? I hated myself and how I was affecting the ones I loved.,
I now run a service providing emotional support to women suffering from a perinatal mental illness. I love my job and am so passionate about spreading the word that a mental illness isn't something to be ashamed of. I want to live in a world where we don't have to hide away, where we can ask for help without fear of how others might respond. Until this happens, the darkness will continue and many many people will continue will suffer in silence.,This blog was originally published in the ,."
,"I always had a reputation for being laid back and happy go lucky. This is why it came as such a shock to my friends and family when I finally faced my issues and discussed what I'd been going though.,After being diagnosed with depression I started counselling sessions. It helped to be able to sit and discuss my issues. It made me realise that I was not the first person to feel this way. I felt I was in a safe environment and that I could speak freely and not be judged. The sessions helped me understand so much more about myself, my problems and how I'd been dealing with them or not as the case had been. Speaking to my family was also a great help. At first my mother was upset that I had not spoken to her about what I was going through but she soon understood my reason and was just glad I was now getting help. The guidance from my counselling sessions gave me the confidence to speak more openly with my family about my issues.,Speaking to family and close friends is one thing, returning back to work is another. I had been signed off work sick when I had first been diagnosed with depression. I worked in an office environment and I knew how stories, rumour and conjecture spread in a place like that. I had been off work for a couple of months and, apart from a home visit from my supervisor, I had not really had much contact from people I'd worked with.,People didn't really seem to know how to deal with my return. I don't blame them or hold it against them as I understand it must be awkward. They seemed like they would rather not speak to me for fear of saying the wrong thing. This did not ease my nervousness about returning and for a while I felt isolated, not even knowing to what extent people had knowledge of my illness. This wasn't helped by hearing the odd sarcastic comment. Growing up mixed race in 70's and 80's Briton I had faced prejudice on many occasions and have a pretty good understanding of how it works. A lot of prejudice is based on fear and ignorance. We fear what we do not understand and because of our ignorance of the facts some people fill the blanks of their knowledge with stereotypes that reinforce their blinkered view.,I knew the best way to overcome this predjudce over my colour was to show people that I'm not a stereotype that we are all complex individuals with a lot to offer. It will be the same to overcome the stigma of mental health: to show that my illness does not define me as a character but is part of who I am; to speak freely and help people understand the issues myself and others face.,

It has not been an easy journey and I know it’s far from over but dealing with my illness has given me the drive and determination to help others., ,Read part 1 of Glen's blog: , ,Or find out ,., "
," ,People have a fear of the unknown and some communities still are fearful of mental health and the embarrassment it can cause within their community. I can relate to this as having suffered with recurring depression and psychosis, I have fought for my family to acknowledge the fact my condition exists and also is nothing to hide. Talking about it helps and that is the premise of , for the Asian Film Festival. In it a young girl is seen to reassure her mother that there is nothing to be ashamed of when it comes to mental health and that all households are affected or may know someone who suffers with a mental health condition. ,Parties, wedding receptions can typically be a time of anxiety for families living with mental illness. Such questions arise as ‘what will people think?’, ‘what will they say?’ and ‘will they notice my daughter is behaving oddly?’ These are the questions I think my family asked themselves as I attended family weddings whilst unwell. One wedding was particularly an awful experience for us all as it was the first time I became unwell and it was at the very early stages of diagnoses. I remember acting very hyper at the wedding and only a select few of my close family knowing the seriousness of what was going on in my life. I will never forget my dad’s look of worry and at not knowing how to handle the situation. ,Fortunately, years have gone by and having had 2 more episodes of my illness, a lot more people in my community know about my experience and what we as a family have been through. No one to my knowledge has treated me any differently since realising I had a mental health condition. If anything we have been met with empathy and confessions of how mental health has affected other families. A problem shared is definitely a problem halved and I have always found that honesty is the best policy. My condition does not rule my life and nor should it. I am happy to join in family occasions and celebrate like everyone else and I am blessed to say I now have a family that embraces this change. ,The best thing for any family to do in a situation like the one expressed in , is to be honest. Mental health may not always be easy to talk about but at least acknowledging it exists can help reduce the shame and stigma. It also is the best thing to do for the individual suffering because like someone who has cancer or a heart condition, they deserve some empathy. It’s time for people to not be afraid what others may think or say and talk about mental health. It’s time to talk, it’s time to change.  "
,"I worked as a Nursing Assistant in Acute
,, Elderly Mental Health and forensic Mental Health since 1989 to
2007. Within this time I was seconded to university to study to become a
Registered Mental Health Nurse. This is where my eyes began to open regarding
my own mental well being. ,In many lectures, I started to think the tutors were
talking about me: delusions of grandeur, yes I get that; psychosis, a tick to
that one too; isolation, I could relate to this, ,, tick and the list
went on. My fear went through the roof. ,At the end of my 2nd year I was
hospitalised for 3 weeks as a voluntary Patient but I was told I would be
sectioned if I tried to leave. There I was medicated for a mood disorder. This
all felt very surreal. One minute I was administering medication as a Student
Nurse and the next minute I was on the other side of the meds trolley being
administered medication as a Patient. I remember thinking that this would help
me become a good Nurse as I could see things from both sides. I took in
everything that the Nursing Staff did - there were both good things and bad. I
asked the psychiatrist would it be advisable to continue with my nurse training
at my discharge meeting; he immediately said, yes, we need more nurses like you
because you understand. ,I returned back to university a week later.
I decided to be open about my diagnosis - to my own detriment. Walking back
into the University took a great deal of courage. I saw all my cohort sat
relaxing in the common area. They saw me coming and looked away. Not one of
them asked me how I was and I remember feeling very alone. I walked passed them
all and went out for a cigarette, my heart pounding through my chest. Then I
went on to our first session of the day. I remember thinking: what hope do patients
have when the staff cannot even ask a friend how they are. I felt lonely, angry
and very hurt.  ,By lunch time all I wanted to do was run
away and hide but I thought “no”: I have worked far too hard for this, much
harder than any of them can comprehend. Outside having another cigarette I was
approached by a couple of my peers who said, ""We're so sorry Paula, we
didn't know what to say"" and one of them hugged me. I cried because I felt
like one of the gang again and not invisible. It's beginning to upset me as I
remember this so I will cut this story short...,Although the university was aware of my
diagnosis, no support was given. I went straight into my Community Placement, told
my mentor about my diagnosis and was told to keep it to myself. How I got
through that Placement is beyond me. I then went onto my final module of
Management Placement but became ill again only 5 weeks before the end of the
entire course. I passed every assignment and placement I
had done but I was timed out  - all of
that hard work and no recognition. I received no support from the University and
no support from the employers who seconded me.,With no job I felt that I had no purpose.
This in turn left me with little confidence and no self-esteem. I had been isolating
myself for years. Social isolation is soul destroying. I wouldn't open the
curtains, I didn't move from the time my husband went out until he came home.
My bones ached. Not eating or drinking until my Husband reminded me that I
hadn't eaten. I felt nothing but aches & pains. ,After 4 years of asking I got therapy. This
changed my life. From there I got suggestions that I should join an art group
to help combat my social isolation; just a couple of hours on a Wednesday. I
hadn't painted a thing since school but I loved every minute. From there I now
hire my own studio and hope to have a solo exhibition this year. ,With the right
encouragement you can get strong again. I have just been asked to speak at The
Rotary Club Dinner about Mental Health. I feel so passionate about all of this,
I now want to shout it from the roof tops. "
,"Depression is an illness of paradoxes. The harder you fight it, the harder it gets. The more you think about it, the more convoluted the conundrum becomes. As soon as you think you're well again, bang, it hits you harder than ever.,And it is the loneliest condition on the planet - even though tens of millions of people suffer from it. Why? Because most of us still prefer to suffer in silence. There are clear downsides to ""coming out"", reasons to be terrified. Friends might desert us; partners might turn their back on us. Employers won't want us. People will give us funny looks, and start crossing the street to avoid us. Being open may put us in a pigeonhole from which we may fret that we'll never emerge.,Some of these concerns may be well founded. Employers still have much to do before they can say they treat the mentally ill just like anyone else. And some people will indeed have a hard time understanding exactly what is wrong. Despite its prevalence this is still a deeply misunderstood condition. There - another paradox.,But speaking out is the first step back from the brink. I did so and it only had positive effects. It is remarkable just how many people sought me out, called me up or accosted me in the playground or at work to speak with me - about themselves, a partner, a relative or somebody they used to know. There was a snowball effect. And it was virtuous.,Because the first thing you realise is: you're not alone. This is not a unique horror that you are enduring but a ubiquitous one. People have endured, and are enduring, the same thing as you. There is a whole pathology, a literature, a community out there which can tell you what to expect, what to consider, what to avoid and how to accept what is happening to you.,The second thing that you realise is what a powerful release it is to spend time with people in the same boat as you. Within weeks, I had a small network of the broken and the beleaguered. We swapped stories and symptoms over camomile tea, or occasionally something stronger if times were suddenly on the up again. We would ask each other how we were coping, what we did to fill the long days, whether we had a back-to-work plan and bigger questions: what we wanted from the rest of our lives; what our depression had taught us. And then we would leave each other feeling slightly more secure about our illness.,This is particularly important when it comes to rumination. Obsessive negative thoughts are a defining symptom of depression. Initially the sufferer finds it hard not to shrink in the face of these terrifying statements: ""I'll never get better,"" ""I can't do this much longer,"" ""what's to become of me?"" It is only when we meet other people having exactly the same thoughts that we have a sudden moment of marvellous insight: these thoughts are not specific to me; they are symptomatic of the illness; they tell me nothing about me and my life, they are just the sinister agitprop of a mind in meltdown. Once we can see our thoughts with this detachment, it becomes easier to avoid buying in to their nefarious suggestions.,Coming out was the first big step I took. Not back to where I'd come from, but forward to a new resolution. From there it was a short step towards acceptance, which is still for me the biggest element in recovery. For ironically it is not until we and the world around us have properly accepted our condition that we can put it behind us. Like I said, depression is all about paradox., ,Mark Rice-Oxley's is an assistant news editor at the Guardian. His book , is published by Little Brown. Follow him on , ,Or find out ,., "
,"After 10 years of yearning, investigations into places where, quite frankly, no one should have to go, and finally resignation, our much longed for baby surprised us in April 2008. At the age of 42 a new baby is never going to be a breeze physically speaking but then when is it ever? Thousands of women do it every day. I’ll cope!! Despite the misgivings of my health visitor I was determined not to be the one in 4 with a past history of , to succumb to ,. It seemed an odd thing to even contemplate when you were so happy at last. I didn’t take into account the dreaded hormones. After 9 months of motherhood although still ok emotionally, I was exhausted and then... the hormones kicked in and CRASH...,
I stopped sleeping, had constant ,, panic attacks, loss of appetite and worse still ... complete disinterest in my baby!! How could I tell anyone? As someone later said to me “But I thought that’s what you wanted?” I waved my husband off to work each morning with a mounting sense of dread for the day ahead and remained locked in a state of panic till he came home. It was awful, quite simply the bleakest time in my life and secretly I gave myself 6 months of feeling like this before I committed suicide, I could not contemplate feeling like this for any length of time.,
Of course my husband noticed, the gp was visited, health visitor (life saver) called and after a year, various anti depressants, an inpatient stay, CBT and a wonderful Community Mental Health Nurse I recovered. Not to mention the support of my husband, family and friends (I soon discovered who they really were).,
I have met during this time some extraordinary people and now am a peer support worker for a mental health charity and continue to meet fabulous people every day. However “normal peoples” attitudes still baffle and anger me. Comments like “I wouldn’t have another baby with your personality”... But I make it a policy to tell people I meet straight away that I have Mental Health issues and am proud of it. It has made me a more rounded, more tolerant person and I only wish that I had not tried to suffer in silence for so long before getting help. I now tell every new Mum I meet that I had Post Natal Depression and many admit their feelings to me. It’s a privilege to hear their stories.,Find out more about , from:, "
,"""I have mental health problems"". How daunting and overwhelming does that sound? It's certainly not something I've ever said aloud before. It feels strange, like something that applies to other people. But that's the thing about mental health isn't it ... it's all around and affects people you would never expect, who you would never ,.,But once you start to face up to it, it feels like it's everywhere you turn, forcing you to accept what you've been denying for years. So here's the thing: "","". And guess what, the world didn't stop turning as I wrote that last full stop!  It has been with me on and off since I was a teenager, when I made some particularly inept suicide attempts. So why do I feel like such a fraud writing this? Because I have no official diagnosis and, apart from a very short period on anti-depressants in my twenties, I've never seen a medical professional and until late last year, I'd had no real help. I haven't got what I would call a 'serious condition' like bi-polar or schizophrenia and I have no significant trauma in my past to explain the way I feel. Yet I am depressed and I don't know how to control it.,So at the ripe old age of 30-something my inability to cope with the stresses of my life made me bite the bullet and look for help. Those stresses are nothing so major - I have a good life, with a stable job and loving husband - but still I find the pressure I put on myself hard to handle. And that's what makes it so hard to talk about, so hard to explain. How can I expect my boss, my family and friends to understand or take it seriously when I have nothing to complain about, no label to explain my feelings or behaviour? How could I hold my head up and talk about depression with no fear when all around me my peers are coping and achieving?,So I've started a journey into a whole new world - talking about how I really feel, diary keeping, depression scales, and probably generally leaving my unfortunate new therapist feeling like he's taken on an unpredictable whirlwind! I'm a few months in and it feels too early to say what the outcome will be - I'm not really sure what it should be? A miracle cure would be nice but for now it's a liberating feeling just to be able to talk and have space to share and be open without the need for that brave, external face of someone in control and coping with every day.,And since starting that journey, I've found a whole other world of information and support, of sites like this. And I hope that by writing this, albeit anonymously, in a small way it will help other people in my position come to feel that they too deserve support, regardless of diagnosis or history. For if I'm sure of anything, it's that I'm not unique. This is a small step compared to the brave people who share their stories publicly and openly for the benefit of all, but to me that's how big changes sometimes happen - with lots of  people taking one small step together. I might still be whispering but finally it is time for me to talk."
,"I met James when I was 21. We were friends for many years before we started a relationship. I believe I had suffered undiagnosed episodes of depression since my early teens.  Before meeting James I had a series of bad relationships, choosing the wrong type of guy and throwing myself into the wrong type of relationships. I had been hurt and eventually on the advice from my GP sought counseling.  I began on a road of self discovery and spent 3 years being single and learning about myself and what I wanted for my future.,James was a constant presence in my life and after a couple of years our friendship evolved into a relationship.  I never disclosed to him that I suffered with mental illness. Because life was good I don’t think I ever thought about telling James. I was convinced that it was behind me and with medication and counseling I had worked through my problems. With hindsight I think I was just scared that he would look at me like I was broken and that he wouldn’t understand and tell me like many other boyfriends - to “pull myself together”.,After being with James for a year I accepted a new job and things were great but soon enough I began to feel low. I understand now that the job wasn’t right for me and I felt like I was constantly fighting against the tide to keep my head above water. I don’t think I wanted to admit to myself what was happening and as a result I started to do things that were typical of when I am depressed.  I would erratically spend money, becoming secretive about my spending habits and not being truthful to those around me. I lied to people at work about things so I wouldn’t let them down but, when they found out Id lied, that’s exactly how they felt. It was all because I was trying to hide what was happening to me from my friends, family, colleagues and most importantly myself. ,It all came to a head when the lies I had told at work became exposed. Someone at my work became concerned about me and rang a friend of mine. That friend then rang James and he confronted me with what was happening. I was so scared of him finding out that I broke down and was physically sick and then continued to deny all knowledge of my behavior. I went to the doctors and she diagnosed me with general anxiety disorder and depression and suggested I seek counseling. I could no longer hide from James and had to tell him everything. It was one of the hardest conversations I have had in my entire life. I had already convinced myself that James wouldn’t understand and that he would want to leave me once he found out. As soon as I told him I felt a big relief that I was free of the lie I was living. 
,James didn’t run away. It was something he hadn’t experienced directly or indirectly but he researched things on the internet, did a lot of reading and told me that he loved me and accepted that it may or may not be a part of our lives together. He told me he was always there to talk and wanted to help and understand what I was feeling and going through. It was a huge turning point in my life as I had never been with anyone who wanted to support me through my low times. I had always been with people who didn’t want to understand and just wanted it to go away. Being around people like this just enforced my idea that nobody would understand and it was best dealt with privately because if anyone found out I would be negatively labeled and misunderstood. ,The fact that education on the subject is more readily available and that campaigns like Time to Change exist helps with being more open. I’m sure that having the conversation with James was by far the best thing I have ever done. My relationship is stronger, more secure and closer than it ever would have been had I kept this from him. He is more informed and I feel like if things are going wrong I don’t have to cope on my own., ,Or find out ,."
,"Some of you will know that my personal Clipper journey is one which is partly challenging my fears and anxieties - you might say therapy - and partly in aid of helping destigmatise mental illness (find out more on my website - ,). So I often try and look at my whole sailing experience to see what lessons it can provide me in relation to my personal anxieties. And, upwind sailing I find helps me get a great perspective on all this. Here's how...,The winds presented during the stretch from Singapore to China are predominantly North / North Easterly - and given this is the direction we are headed it means we will be 'beating' into the winds. If you haven't sailed, I guess the best way to imagine the difficulties this represents is to imagine a surfer going out towards the surf from the beach. He must beat his way through waves which come crashing down on him, often getting pushed back by their oncoming force. Whereas going with the surf (like downwind sailing) he glides along the waves. The forces on the boat when heading into the winds are such that we will always be healed over at an angle of around 45degrees - so life on the slant, while crashing up and down. So as you can see, heading into the wind already feels a lot more uncomfortable than the so called 'champagne sailing' that smooth, flat, downwind sailing can offer.,Now let me give you a feel for how what I call the 'drama volume' getting turned up. Imagine a light breezy day - hop on your bicycle for a ride, heading into the wind, and of course before you know it you are creating your own wind (you could also imagine hanging your head out of a car window) - what seemed like a calm day now feels different - the wind blowing across your body, hair flying and whistling through your ears.,Now imagine how this affects you on a 68 foot yacht, crashing up and down the oncoming waves like a surfer. All of a sudden you can't hear the person shouting at you from 10 feet away, the wind aggressively whooshing through your ears. Add to this the many clonks, crashes and whistles that the apparent wind creates as it meets the boats many surfaces and hopefully you can get a feel for the drama! Oh no, actually, lets now turn out the lights and add some rain! Now our drama volume is around 10!,It's at times like this that I imagine the stress that at times in my life has lead to periods of depression. But as I've come to learn it is often my perception of situations which cause my depression rather than the reality of the situation... so how might we change our perception?,What if I shut out the noise... that feels less dramatic.,What if we put the decklight on and I pull up my hood. I definitely feel more able to cope.,And what, if I imagine, that if we turned the boat around by 180 degrees, surfing down the waves, following the wind - the drama volume now set to a much more easy listening 2 or 3.,If I imagine how close we actually are to this scenario - a simple turn of the wheel - I find myself all together calmer.So the next time you find yourself in a stressful situation, try and see how you might turn the drama volume down - or if things just get a little too much, turn and head in the opposite direction for a little while., ,By supporting Richard on this epic challenge and ,, you will be demonstrating that you too believe that it is “time to change” – that you are prepared to play a part in helping end mental health discrimination and destigmatise mental illness.,Original blog published on "
,"Somebody asked me recently why I don't do political cartoons. I had a think. I didn't know. But I've thought a bit more, and now I do know. The reason I don't do political cartoons is that the things that are really wrong with the world, that really make me angry and need lampooning, aren't politicians. It's not powerful individuals who need bringing down a peg or two. It's bad ideas.  ,Admittedly, politicians are responsible for believing in a lot of bad ideas. But they're not the real problem. The problem is the assumptions that underlie the world, that we all absorb without even realising it. ,One of the most damaging ideas I can see is the idea of 'Normal'. And under this banner falls the idea that a mental health problem is not a 'normal' (ie physical) health problem. ,I'm lucky enough not to have been touched by mental health problems in the past, but friends I know who have had depression have often said that the worst thing is not being able to talk about it in the same way that you might a 'physical' condition. Mental illness is not considered by most people to be the same as 'normal' illness, and both sufferers and non-sufferers often find it difficult to talk about it as such. ,The roots of this idea aren't particularly evil. The world has long laboured under the strange, quasi-religious notion that the 'mental' is in some ways distinct from the 'physical', as if our brains are some sort of mystical landscape distinct from our bodies. It's a vain and reassuring belief that tells us we're more than just walking lumps of meat. As such it's quite understandable - I for one have always fancied myself as something more than a massive bearded pork chop with legs(!). ,But the overall consequence of this idea for people who have mental health problems is that their condition is often treated as in some way 'unreal'. Something spiritual, or 'emotional'. Just recently I spoke to a friend whose employer behaved as if their time off with depression was some kind of fantastic indulgence, and that they probably shouldn't expect to get such a nice holiday again. No wonder people find it hard to talk about. ,The Dare advertising agency first approached me in November to join the creative process on the Time To Change mental health awareness campaign. The idea of the ads was that they'd try and knock a few corners off this massive ideological chunk of stigma, and maybe get people talking about mental health on a casual, day-to-day basis. ,I was really impressed with how they'd handled the job in the past. The previous campaign's TV ads had managed to make funny, thought-provoking sketches from a really sensitive issue by using well-judged, perfectly-acted comedy. This isn't an easy thing to do at all: humour in advertising is always a tricky thing to get right, but when your campaign is a subject as serious as mental health stigma, it becomes something of a massively tricky festival of trickiness.  ,My part of the commission was to do a series of cartoon strips and two-panel postcards to supplement the campaign. The strips were written in-house by the creative team at Dare media in consultation with Time To Change, and it was a real pleasure to work with people who'd written the comics so well.  I was pleased to find I could contribute some ideas to the design of the strips and how best to present the humour. Dare then asked me to write some extra two-frame cartoons from scratch, showing how mental health shouldn't be scary to talk about. I eventually came up with a series of postcard cartoons that contrasted everyday 'easy' conversations about mental health with genuinely 'scary' conversations, such as a guy asking King Kong to give him his girlfriend back, or trying to persuade aggressive aliens to go home. ,It is a fairly subtle change the ads are trying to make, but a massively important one. In trying to nudge people's social habits towards something more constructive and less taboo-supporting, this campaign is a step on the road toward a more respectful, healthy attitude to mental health issues. An attitude that would be, dare I say it, a bit more 'normal'."
,"These are the words which you worry you’ll come across time after time when you are diagnosed with what is now clinically referred to as ‘Health Anxiety’. Of course everyone becomes concerned with their health at certain points in their life but, for me, health anxiety became debilitating when it combined with the onset of depression at the beginning of last year.,Somebody who suffers with health anxiety goes beyond what is classed as normal, rational behaviour and fully believes that they have a serious (often terminal/incurable) medical condition, which leads them to seek out medical advice as soon as a new headache, lump, ache or pain appears.,I lived in such a heightened state of anxiety that I could not function. I had bouts of what can only be described as severe ‘brain fog’ where your thoughts just do not add up and it feels as though you are walking around in a bubble, isolated from the outside world, your friends, family and any kind of social situation. Combined with this was wanting to sleep all day, having no energy, total depletion of any appetite, shaking, blurred vision, de-personalisation and severe memory loss – a cycle which continually fed the health anxiety leading me to head into a darker place – depression.,I bought some self help books on health anxiety, which I was slowly working through but the feelings continued to get worse. It all came to a head when I bolted out of London to stay with my Aunt in Essex, who understood what I was going through, cared and looked after me and continuously reassured me that I would be ok – she was my rock.,I had been suffering for a long time by this point, and one evening I managed to get myself to sit down for dinner when suddenly a huge rush of anxiety came over me. I started shaking, blurred vision made me feel as though I was going to fall off my chair and I burst out crying. I physically and mentally could not handle it anymore and my mind had gone into shut down. My Aunt decided that we needed to go out for a long walk to clear my mind and help me calm down. It was then that I decided that I couldnt carry on like this.,The first step was to bypass my previous GP (I now have a fantastic GP who listened whole heartedly to my problems and provided me with a proper diagnosis) and to pay for private therapy. I began seeing a hypnotherapist/Cognitive Behavioural Therapist once a week who ran through my history and what I wanted to achieve. He recognised I was in a very bad place and helped me to relax and interupt my thought process when it came to thinking I was ill unnecessarily. Just to have somebody to talk to and be frank with for an hour once a week was an enormous relief for me – and for a good few months, I felt more relaxed and calm.,Throughout all this time, I carried on going to work, believing that it would help me maintain a sense of normality when I thought I was going mad, but it got to a point where I had to let somebody know what was happening – incase my work began to suffer. I initially did not speak about my problems at work. I thought that I could handle it myself and it would pass, I also did not want to put myself in a vulnerable position during a financially difficult time for most businesses.,When I realised that it wasn't just going to 'blow over', I spoke to my boss, who was very good about it, and, whilst not necessarily understanding the health anxiety aspect, he listened to me and advised that where possible he would help me through this. I was pleasantly surprised by his positive reaction which helped me gain confidence that I can get through this And just to know that you have some breathing room helped enormously and reduced some of the pressure.,Nowadays, most people know someone who has or had anxiety disorders or depression, and therefore have a grasp on how it can change a person and how terrifying it can be. I have found that most people I have spoken to, both personally and at work have reacted well, and I have been lucky enough not to suffer any direct discrimination or negativity towards me.,I still regularly begin to feel as though I’m slipping back into old behaviours. However, I now recognise the symptoms and have decided to start seeing a new therapist who has been very supportive and understanding.,I read somewhere that people suffering health anxiety are more likely to consider ‘dark’ thoughts than other forms of depression and anxiety. What I want to achieve from this blog is to say that you are not alone, it will pass and you will be ok. Please just try to remember that.

,"Myself and my family had been though a series of personal tragic and traumatic events. My wife had lost one of our unborn twins and the surviving twin was delivered early to save both my son and wife. My father was diagnosed with lung cancer.  He was surrounded by people who loved him but we watched on as my dad fought, struggled and died a painful death in front of us. This had a profound effect on me. But also as the eldest son I felt that I had to be the strong one and perhaps around this time was the start of my putting on a front.,Over the coming years things did not improve. My marriage broke down, I was made redundant and  also diagnosed with a heart condition that took a number of years and many trials in medication to control. ,It now felt that there was a cloud hanging over me. I called it impending feeling of doom syndrome. I was now at a point where externally people thought I was doing ok: I was employed, my heart condition was under control and I was in a happy relationship. But I could not relax because in my mind it was only temporary until the next disaster come up. I tried to keep the happy go lucky facade up but it just became harder and harder to do this. ,I found myself making excuses not to speak to people. If I was walking down the street and I saw someone in the distance I'd not seen in a while I'd avoid them rather than speak to them. I found it harder and harder to face going outside. When on a bus I'd have panic attacks and just need to get away.,I just kept these feelings bottled up inside. Part of me wrongly thought that it would be a sign of weakness to admit to these feelings. Some kind of macho pride was getting in the way. Another issue was who to speak to: I felt my family had enough of their own problems and I did not want to burden them with my problems. How could I discuss this with my friends? People who had already commented to me how impressed they were that I could keep positive and smile in the face of adversity. How could I admit that I was not dealing with my problems and living a lie?,This all came to a head when one day it all got too much for me. I had a particularly bad episode and whilst on the way to work I just broke down on the side of the road and started crying. I just could not face going on like this my mind was all over the place. It felt like I had too many thoughts. I was obsessive about things I could not control and I did not know how I could move forward. I knew I could not carry on like this and if I'm honest I did consider another way out I thought about just ending it all. I thought that this way my son would not have to face the disappointment of seeing what a failure his father was.,I needed help. This was now clear to me. I went to my GP. I was nervous about telling him what I'd been thinking. Part of me felt ashamed and I still had this thought that somehow I'd failed by not being able to deal with this. My doctor was very understanding and he knew my family well. We spoke about the reason why I had not discussed this with my family. Just speaking to him did not magically make everything better but I knew this was a start and for the first time in ages I started to see a way forward.,After being diagnosed with depression I started counselling sessions. It helped to be able to sit and discuss my issues. It made me realise that I was not the first person to feel this way I felt I was in a safe environment and that I could speak freely and not be judged. The sessions helped me understand so much more about myself, my problems and how I'd been dealing with them or not as the case had been. Speaking to my family was also a great help. At first my mother was upset that I had not spoken to her about what I was going though  but she soon understood my reason and was just glad I was now getting help. ,The guidance from my counselling sessions gave me the confidence to speak more openly with my family about my issues. I was finally facing up to the fact that I was ill. Just as with my heart condition needed treatment to improve and get better so did my depression.

,"In 2007 I was managing a women’s refuge. I was really enjoying my job and was very passionate about it. However I was having some problems with work colleagues and bullying.,I remember going into work one day and feeling a sense of panic, the room started to spin I felt sick and I felt really low and kind of numb. I remember walking out of my job and going home just wanted to hide. I felt so frightened.,This was the start of a downward spiral. I never returned to work, I started to get about 10 panic attacks a day and feel very depressed. I wasn’t new to depression. I had a bout of it in 2002. The worst part about it all was the discrimination I faced: my employer continually harassed me, calling me daily and asking me when I would return to work. I received bullying emails.,Things just went from bad to worse. The depression worsened and my anxiety was so severe I was offered a hospital admission. A couple of weeks later I received a letter from my employer saying they were dismissing me. I had studied law for 12 years and knew this was unfair. Despite feeling like my world had fallen apart I managed to take action against my employer and won an out of court settlement for unfair dismissal. I wasn’t worried about compensation, it was the principle: how dare they treat me like this.,I started to make a recovery and it was while I was in a waiting room at my local mental health team that I saw a notice about Time to Change. I looked it up on the internet and started campaigning. I decided that my situation wasn’t unique and that the discrimination out there must be happening to others.,I wrote a letter to Gordon Brown asking him if I could have a meeting with him and discuss the Time to Change campaign and mental health stigma. The weeks went by and not a word. I phoned number 10 and was told I would get a letter. To my utter amazement a letter arrived from Gordon Brown asking me if I would go to see his senior health advisor. I was gobsmacked. I had just written an ordinary letter.,I went to number 10 and met Greg Beales who was the senior health advisor at the time. I told him my story and how much discrimination I had faced. I said there needed to be a change to the law and job applications that ask questions about disability should be stopped. Greg said he was very interested in Time to Change and would do all he called to support the campaign.,About six months later I heard that there had been a change to the Equality Act, which included pre- medical questionnaires being abolished. I was ecstatic. The charities Mind and Rethink had been campaigning hard and so had I.,Since this time I have campaigned on behalf of Time to Change. I have given talks about the campaign and done a ,. I recently attended the ,, which was to thank people for what they have done with Nick Clegg. The launch as I understand it was a celebration of the campaign so far. It was really good and great to hear from two young champions and their experiences of mental health. It was also great to meet so many other campaigners and celebrities.,Time to Change really changed my life as it gave me the courage to speak up for myself and others.

,"Speaking out about mental illness and my experiences is hard!  I’ve just found how difficult it is to speak out while writing this blog.  I have had four psychotic episodes over the past ten years and have experienced depression and anxiety.  I have worked pretty much the whole time in different workplaces and contexts. , 

I have found that experiences at work often really depend upon your line manager and the relationship you have with them.  I currently work at a London university and really enjoy my job.  I’ve been honest with my line manager about my experiences and she has been extremely supportive and understanding.  I had two psychotic episodes last year and she gave me space and support at a time when I was vulnerable. , 

Having a good relationship with your line manager is not always as easy as all that!  I’ve had a lot of different experiences along the way, not all good.  I have experienced stigma and on one occasion fear from an employer.  This is where the difficulty of speaking out comes in.  I found, when writing about it, that I didn’t want to go into detail about it.  Why?  Because the situation was between me and the line manager, there were others in that work place whom I got on very well with, I don’t want to write negatively about it now. , 

When I was writing about it, I started blaming myself and that is a real problem with mental illness.  It’s all too easy to feel it’s your fault that a job isn’t working out.  It often feels like you’re the one with the problem.  When actually the problem is your employer not knowing enough about managing someone who has experienced mental illness.

In order for those of us who have experienced mental illness to be supported in the workplace there needs to be training and information available in order to promote greater understanding from employers. I have found the best type of relationship with your line manager is based on trust and understanding.  I’ve been very lucky to experience this from my current line manager, and others.  But in these cases it relied upon their own personality and natural affinity with people.  This isn’t enough.  Line managers need to have more information in order to manage people who have had mental health experiences well. , 

There also needs to be an atmosphere in which the employee can feel able to ask for reasonable adjustments.  Legally this is the right of those with a disability, but in reality I’ve found they are incredibly difficult to ask for.  You feel you should be able to just ‘get on’ with your job and often at work there is an atmosphere perpetuating this feeling. , 

At my current work I have a card system whereby if I'm feeling anxious and over stressed I put out a card to signal this to the team, so I can get on with things quietly.  If I need to take a break because of the stress I put out another card.  It's a way of communicating without having to find the words to explain and it works really well.  I actually find I don't use it much because just knowing the means of communication is there is a confidence boost.  So reasonable adjustments don't have to be big or taxing for either the employer or employee. ,

For me, I’ve found that if I’m honest about my experiences with my line manager at the beginning of a relationship, that has paved the way for a deepening of the relationship and for trust to be established.  I don’t mean I’ve gone into huge detail about my experiences.  But I’ve mentioned the word ‘psychotic episodes’ and said ‘it sounds scary but isn’t, I manage it.’ Then I’ve got on with my job.  It can also be helpful if your line manager feels confident enough to let you just get on with things.  There’s nothing worse than feeling you’re being watched all the time, or assessed.  I’ve found it can really break your confidence and affect your ability to do your job well. , 

I have experienced stigma at work in the past, which really affected me and my confidence.  However, I continued to work, and found a job that gave me a better work-life balance with a great team who are supportive.  It really is possible to find supportive work.  But this shouldn’t rely upon the understanding nature of some people’s personalities.  All line managers should be made aware of their responsibilities and of the legal rights of employees with regard to reasonable adjustments.  And they should be encouraged to listen to and trust their employees. , 

People want to be able to do a good job.  Let’s encourage a working environment that allows that to happen., ,Find out more about what support and information is available for , and ,., "
,"Acknowledging you have a mental illness can be difficult, even more so when you have spent your life working as a qualified mental health nurse dedicated to helping others. Herein lies the irony I suppose. In 2004 I experienced severe depression which had been insidiously creeping up on me for many months before. As with most men I was in denial telling myself I could overcome this and that depression only affects others. How wrong I was of course, but isn’t hindsight a wonderful thing?,On the advice of my manager I took time off work. I had become a prisoner to my work adopting a masochistic mindset of ‘letting everyone down’ if I was to not be there, such was my unreasonable sense of ‘duty’ and ‘loyalty’. This also proved to be one of the significant ‘stressors’ that had compounded my condition in the end.,Taking time off work and starting on anti depressant medication were both alien to me but the period of time away from the stress of work helped me greatly. It also gave me an opportunity to re evaluate my life and my priorities. It gave me the breathing space necessary to reflect on how I had arrived at that point.,Most of my colleagues and friends were very supportive of my condition and this of course helped, I appreciated that very much. I recall one day walking down stairs with a face etched in pain and sadness and my colleague asking if I was okay. I wasn’t of course but I still lied because I had lost all insight into how ill I had become by then. ,I have been quite active in anti stigma work around mental health and following my recovery, my illness became a catalyst for carrying out anti stigma work with more vigour. It whetted my appetite and passion to try and avoid where possible others repeating my mistakes and stigmatising themselves.,When the Time to Change campaign started I knew I wanted to be part of this social movement, it excited me like no other campaign. My career as a mental health nurse, and my personal experience of depression, equipped me with the psychiatric knowledge and personal empathy to try to make a difference for others. I had seen how stigma had ruined people lives and perpetuated many peoples struggles with mental illness. ,Soon after, I was interviewed for the role on LEAP ( lived experience advisory panel) covering my native north east of England and successful in acquiring that position. Since then I have been very active in different areas of Time to Change, but mostly the media work.,In many ways Time to Change has changed me. It gave me a clear focus and added impetus to use my skills and experience, and perhaps more importantly my passion, to encourage real change in society. It has given me hope that finally here is a dedicated  national campaign to eradicate the scourge of the stigma and discrimination of mental health., ,Talking about mental health can break down stereotypes and take the taboo out of something that affects us all. ,Find out more about bipolar disorder from:"
,"""Mental illness isn't something you just get over, it's with you for life; even if you overcome the symptoms, the effects will be with you forever - and that is why we will always need organisations like Time to Change.,I believe I became depressed at 13, although at the time I didn't really know what was wrong; I took an overdose, but I didn't really want to die...I just didn't know what else to do. Back then, there was no one you could really talk to, and internet searches just led to really negative people. I couldn't tell my friends because I didn't want them to think I was weird, so I suffered in silence until I was 23 years old; my father had been diagnosed with depression and after seeing how he was treated by friends, family and even doctors, I vowed I would never tell anyone. However, 10 years of suffering in silence took its toll and I became scared for my life - so I went to my GP. He was nice and tried to be understanding, but wasn't really helpful; he just kept suggesting various medications even though I swore that I'd never ever take medication - I still have all the meds he ever prescribed!,When people ask me how I got better without any support or medication, I simply can't answer them - but I can guarantee that if Time to Change had been around then, it would have been so much easier. I can still remember the day I found Time to Change - I was messing around on Facebook, as you do, and I saw a really colourful advert; I clicked on it, and it was one of those cartoon moments where a lightbulb appears over your head and I thought to myself, where have you been all my life? Since that day, I've been to three Roadshows, written a blog (with one on the way), did a video interview, contributed to the new leaflet and I've joined the Time to Change Community Engagement Advisory Panel...and I’m just getting started.,I remember the last Roadshow I did, which was in Harrow - there were these four Asian girls and I will never forget the conversation I had with them. When I told them that 1 in 4 people will have some kind of mental issue in their lifetime, they each looked at one another in shock; so I asked them, if your friend came to you because she was worried something may be mentally wrong, what would you say? What would you do? What would each of you say or do in that situation – can you imagine how terrifying it is just to start that conversation? As we talked, it dawned on me just how lucky these girls are; when I was younger, I didn't even think about telling my friends because it simply wasn't done back then. But now, thanks to organisations like Time to Change, such conversations can and are taking place.,Whilst my recovery may be unique, my symptoms are not; there are far too many people who are afraid to tell someone that they have a problem, far too many people suffering in silence because they're ashamed or scared or don’t even understand what is wrong. If people believed that a broken mind is nothing to be ashamed of, and that it’s ok to talk about how they’re feeling, then they would. Having secured funding until March 2015 is fantastic, but that is just the start...what we need now is people out there, letting everyone know that it is okay to talk about these problems. At the Roadshows, we were worried that people would mistake us for fund-raisers, so I coined the phrase - ""we're not raising funds, we're raising awareness"". Please… help us to do just that."", "
,"Whether you see it as a serpent, a vampire, a bully or – as many do – a black dog or a dark cloud, depression is an invisible illness that relishes the dark. ,Because you often have no outward symptoms of depression, it’s not the kind of illness where someone will come up to you in the kitchen at work and say ‘Oh dear, you don’t look well’. There are no spots or swellings to give the game away. ,This is perhaps why depression can end up feeling like a dirty secret. Nobody will know about it if you don’t tell them. And the cruel thing about this illness is that it makes you feel ashamed of it. If you admit to it, terrible things might happen to you. The doctor might PUT YOU ON TABLETS. Oh the shame. You might even get SIGNED OFF WORK. How humiliating.,Both of these things have happened to me. Both have been necessary, and both have helped me. Nobody has given me any stick for it. In fact, the more people I talk to about my depression, the more I realise how common it is, and how many people – old and young, male and female – have experienced it at some point in their lives.,I didn’t talk about my depression for a long time, because I didn’t really want to admit I’d got it. I gradually told a few more of my friends, and the encouraging thing was that they were all so supportive and understanding. Nobody came out with those classic lines ‘Well you look OK to me’ or ‘Pull yourself together’.,The big change for me, though, was when I wrote my first blog about depression. I’d previously written about light-hearted stuff, like going on holiday and bird watching, but something compelled me to write about this hidden scourge of my life. I took a deep breath, posted the link on Twitter and Facebook, where I knew my friends and colleagues would see it, and then sat and wondered whether I’d done the right thing.,Well, I needn’t have worried. The response was overwhelming – humbling, even. And it has been the same whenever I’ve posted anything about depression. There are loads of people out there who are experiencing the same thing, supporting and encouraging each other.,Don’t let your depression trap you in a dark corner. Shine a bright light on it – expose it for the snivelling little viper that it really is. It really won’t like it.,My first step to confronting depression was to admit to myself that I needed some help. My second step was to get that help. And my third was to ‘come out’ about it – to write openly and honestly about what was happening to me. It’s actually quite therapeutic. ,Does this mean I’m cheerfully shouting out about my illness from the rooftops? No – it’s much easier for me to write about it than to talk about it. Not long ago, when someone asked me on the phone why I’d been off work, I told him I wouldn’t bore him with the details, and swiftly moved on. But that was because I didn’t know him very well and felt it was none of his business. ,Many people do know about my depression, including you. And I’m happy about that. Keeping a secret can be stressful – and let’s face it, there are enough stresses in life without creating more of them for yourself. This is one secret you should share."
,"When I saw the story about Roy (find him on Twitter ,) and his experience of work place discrimination, I couldn’t help but be shocked and awed.,I was shocked that when he disclosed his mental illness (depression) to his boss, her reply was:,We're a small company, there's no room for passengers.,However, I was in awe of the fact that so many people on Twitter sent Roy ,. It is great to know that even in the world of social media, prejudice is unacceptable.,The stigma that surrounds mental illness is everywhere, and can often be worse than the condition itself. However, there is a way to , – I am living proof. I am a full time marketing executive, and have been since graduating in 2004. I have won awards, been published, spoken at events all over Europe and have been consulted on large scale media campaigns. Oh yes, and I also have a diagnosis of bipolar and borderline personality disorder.,Living with these conditions should not stop me from being a productive member of society and, luckily for me, they don’t. My employer is a great example of how, with the right support and work place understanding, organisations large and small can employ people with mental heath problems.,How? It really is simple: ,. If I am experiencing depression, they support me working from home. If I am having panic attacks, I am excused from high pressure meetings. Even though I have a pre-existing condition, I am allowed to be part of the company health insurance scheme.,My workload is mine to decide. So if I cannot concentrate for long periods of time I can divide my work up into manageable chunks.,The only other ingredients I think a company needs to support people with disabilities, whether physical or mental, is the ,, the gift of looking at things from a different perspective and the determination to make it work. Organisations may not get it right first time, but they need to be willing to try.,So, to Roy I say good luck, and keep searching for a supportive company who will embrace your differences – they are out there, I promise., "
,"I just read a post by a good online friend (one I have been lucky enough to also meet in real life albeit over a year ago), the lovely Clive Edwards.,I was going to just share his blog on my facebook wall but whilst writing a comment to go with it I realised that this is an issue I have more than a few words to say about. It is about an issue I have come across in my personal life, my friends lives and also as an issue in conversation to do with fighting the stigma of mental distress in society and discrimination about mental health issues.,Here is a short extract.,I am tired of saying I am OK or OK-ish or fine or other euphemisms. We have to find a place where telling the truth isn't whining or complaining. That becomes part of the stigma.,Here is the blog of Clive Edwards, ,.,I am sure this is how many of us feel when healthy friends ask how we are, we often say 'I am ok' or 'not bad', 'better than last week' 'yep, getting better thanks', yeah fine' or even maybe 'not great but musn't grumble, not as bad as some'. But are all these comments really the honest truth and how much are they subjective to the average or mean of our lives?,When you have chronic pain what you (and I) might consider an ok day with manageable pain, that we can still think, do light tasks, cook a meal and do light housework but are still in pain and discomfort and in need of painkillers so might still be(generalising and imagining we have the same tollerances to pain)in the amount of pain that would make a healthy person go to the doctors, have 2 days off work and make their family check in on them offering help. ,Or when you have clinical depression and are not suicidal and not happy and well and depression free you might still be depressed but can function and can put on a happy face to see friends for a few hours before going home and feeling alone, depressed and dejected but you tell friends you are 'ok' how ok are you? Would how you feel if felt by a person who has never felt depressed or had any mental health issues make them break down in tears, take time off work or have friends rallying around as you are having a 'hard' time?,But when it is not a one off, when it is ongoing and has been known about by your doctor, family, colleagues and healthy or busy friends for sometime is it hardly surprising that we start to say 'I'm ok' or 'yeah fine'. Because if(even though it may be a form of therapy and a survival technique to you) you talk about your mental or physical health problems for too long or too many times over a protracted length of time people get bored. It's like the news. If you hear the same thing over and over again you get a little immune to it, maybe even bored of it and sometimes even resent hearing about it because you have your 'own problems' or are 'busy' or even, and this is one I have had said directly to my face but its not an exact quote ""You have had this problem for a while now, isn't it better yet?' and when I replied something like ""So and so has improved but doctors/professionals say I need to do so and so and its hard without support or money"" was followed by ""what are you doing to make it better, are you always going to be like this?"". Let's just say that last person probably thinks they are being taxed too much and that people on benefits are scroungers ;-), sadly though I am related to them :-(, woops!,It's not to say that the busy, working, 'normal' people don't care about us, don't want to help us, don't wish we were better or would love us to be pain free, but because of stigma of mental health issues and also how people with physical health issues become invisible unless they have real support or are able to engage in an almost average life on a par with others, but they get tired of asking how we are when they probably know that this or that problem will always have an impact on us. And they don't want it to have an impact on them. Some will be hurtful, tactless, ignore us and belittle us and others may be the best supporters, friends and family anyone could ever wish for but most people are inbetween, in the grey world where old fashioned comments rear their head like ""mustn't grumble"" and ""you just have to get on with things like I do! I don't have it easy but you don't see me complaining!"" or the one that is bound to make you feel extra guilty ""I wish I could help you more, but I'm so busy, if you just moved closer to me I could do so much more to help, are there not people closer to you that can help?"" is because it comes from someone who has to care for great great grandparents, 5 kids, 6 dogs and 3 aliens as well as a husband bound to make you tell them you ""ok"" because they are such a caring person and you don't want to burden them anymore. Because that's another feeling that pops up. That if you do say how you really feel, mentally or physically you are burdening them.,We may feel either like we are complaining if we tell the truth about how we are or worried we will lose a friend or be labeled as negative and ignored, when in reality the fact that we are still fighting to live and have not given up on life with all the mental health and physical health issues we have to deal with actually means we are strong. Not in the same way as most, because we are nervous about getting out the house, clean the taps 5 times after washing our hands, hear voices, have low self esteem and think we are horrible, have fibro, arthritis, are blind, deaf, in a wheelchair but because we are still fighting to have as independent life as possible.,So if we want to create awareness or spread awareness or just get a little more understanding and support we have to think about how we word things. Yes I know, it's the people with the problems who again have to do all the work but remember we are more adaptable and stronger than the 'average healthy person' whose life never changes much ;-). Even if right now we are down and in pain, grrr.,Anyway, just a few thoughts of mine to get you thinking. Next time someone tells you they are ok or fine stop and think, do they mean it? Can you give them time now or later to give them all your attention? Might it be worth, after a long chat with them checking up on them a few days or week later instead of just thinking that you have done your bit? We know people are busy, we are human and there are lots of us and we all interact in each others lives.,So let's try and think about how saying ""I am fine"" when you are struggling doesn't give a nice person a chance to help you and hearing ""I am feel so lonely and in pain"" doesn't make you wince wishing you could do more but feel guilty and really uncomfortable., ,Or find out ,., "
,"My second bout of severe ,started when I was happy with life. My girlfriend of over ten years had just moved in with me in London where I had started working two years before. I had just been awarded a teaching prize at work and I was also exercising regularly but below the surface things were not all well. In hindsight, there were all the classical warning signs of depression such as loss of appetite, lack of interest in things and early morning waking.,Communication, mutual interests and hope have always been important aspects in our relationship and it was precisely these which were to be tested most in the following two years. During the summer of 2009 I went from bad to worse and far beyond the point of putting on a brave face. Getting out of bed felt like climbing a huge mountain. Almost all I talked about was the bleakness of life, the hopelessness of my situation and all the causes and solutions to my depression I could think of. At the same time, all the big and little joys that had made us happy together eroded rapidly.,A vital part of my recovery has been the support of my girlfriend,A vital part of my recovery has been the support of my girlfriend and particularly the feeling of security and support. She never made steps for me but helped me find my own way through it. She encouraged me with any aspect which would aid my recovery such as exercise, volunteering, GP visits, therapy and getting involved with Time to Change. She helped me to eventually feel more comfortable to talk about my depression with other people.,Deep depression removed all pleasure from both our lives for a long period. We adjusted by trying to take everything step by step and living day by day. For some time we cancelled all major things which could cause unnecessary stress. We took each day as it came and if something didn’t work out we would try something differently the next day. We were able to talk about everything, even difficult and troubling topics such as suicidal thoughts. We made emergency plans in case things took a turn for the worse. It was vital to really listen to each other and for me to keep helping out at home, even if it meant buying a bottle of milk.,A carer can often feel desperate, exhausted and angry,A carer can often feel desperate, exhausted and angry, which takes courage, patience and hope to get through. Carers play a vital role which cannot be expressed in financial terms and their importance is often not recognised by society. Coming through a long and difficult period together has strengthened our relationship as it has shown us how strong we both are and what our love really is about. We understand and appreciate each other on a deeper level now and know that we can fully trust each other.,We have come to appreciate the small things in life much more and tend to worry less. I am extremely grateful to have come out on the other side and that my girlfriend has had the strength and courage to support me through it., "
,"This is because of the fear of the stigma around mental illness which means people are afraid to speak out due to the thought of potential consequences such as losing their job, career, family or friends.  This is something very close to my heart, as I painfully experienced this fear, which probably made me even more ill as I battled to hide my debilitating condition. ,We believe we are living in a modern world with liberal views where ‘anything goes’ but that doesn’t yet extend to mental illness. In this area we still have a long way to go.  I know – I have experienced it.  ,I was at a coffee conference recently doing research for some cafes I am thinking of opening. One of the delegates there asked me why I was considering opening a café and I answered him quite matter of fact, explaining that when I suffered from depression I drank a lot of coffee and was disappointed by the quality of the food, coffee and service in the cafes I had spent time in. He replied, “I’m surprised that you admit to having suffered from depression.” His reply startled me and brought me right back to the reality of the stigma that still prevails. There is still a ‘NIMBY’ attitude towards people affected by mental illness.,I Work within the mental health sector, and it is easy to forget and be protected from the stigma that is still very much felt and shown in the big outside world.  So I decided to set up , to support people suffering from depression because I wanted to offer a safe place for people to be able to share their experiences, concerns and questions confidentially and securely discuss anything related to mental illness.  ,Talking about it and educating people about mental illness is the only way to reduce the stigma.  It really is time to talk and it’s time to change. I hope that things such as my website will help us to move forward and break down the taboo even further, removing this fear and awkwardness about something that affects one in four people in our society."
,"My name is Sitara. I am 22 and live in the south west of England with some other girls. I love to drink tea, sing, and am currently training to be a teacher. I also have a mental illness. I suffer from anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. It’s something that I have found really hard: each day is different and each day is a challenge ,I was on one of the trains during the London bombings. Even though I have got over the event, there are still lots of triggers such as loud bangs, fake blood and crowded situations.  Halloween, for instance, is an event which often really scares me because of the fake blood and the costumes. I know, for some of my friends, it can be seen as silly. But to me it’s a struggle. If I see fake blood on someone, it makes me anxious. So much so I will grip my skin and panic slightly inside.,Right now I am struggling but I am getting better. I feel distant from those around me, almost like there is a box and I hardly let anyone in. I have friends who care but do not know because I cannot tell them. I want to tell them but I am afraid of being laughed at or mocked or told to ‘cheer up’ or ‘get over’ the event. This is because previous friends of mine have said that to me and now I am guarded. So yes, I do hide how I feel inside from the world but I won’t let it define me.,I still am afraid of opening up, even to a doctor. I am trying to pluck up the courage to ask for help. It is hard living with these conditions but I get by and to get by (for me at least) is better than not coping. So I am doing well.,I haven’t even told my parents, they never wanted to know. So I am dealing with this by myself but I really sometimes wish I could tell someone just how I feel but I do still have trust issues.,I am training as a teacher, and it is hard sometimes dealing with feeling low and teaching. But for me the teaching is an escape and I really enjoy it. It’s something I can put so much energy into and I love seeing the children learn. It is hard to stop the nightmares when I am stressed but I don’t care, I love what I do.,I think going through having a mental health problem can leave you more open to seeing the world and caring about it. I found that I have become more empathetic and I really like that. Before, I used to think that depression was something that people can snap out of, but now I understand that it’s not that easy and I feel so bad that I ever thought like that.,So why am I writing this, well I hope it makes someone smile out there because they could hopefully see from my story that things do get better, that things will improve in time. It will be hard. No one told me it would be this hard but it will be worth it for the time when I will feel good again.  "
,"It was a gloomy, cold December and I was really, really unhappy. I’d like to be able to say that feeling unhappy was the extraordinary thing, but that wouldn’t be true. Looking back, I can spot a recurring pattern of mood swings which began when I was about twelve, but it took until my mid-thirties before I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and started to understand what was going on. By last winter, I had lived through many depressive episodes and I was finding them increasingly difficult to deal with. All those years of thinking myself a bad person rather than an ill one had taken their toll - I had learned to be intolerant and critical of myself, which only ever made things worse.,On top of that, I was experiencing a dose of festive anxiety - the sinking feeling that comes from convincing yourself that everyone else is perfect and in control and you’re not. Surely I’m the only one who just missed the last posting date yet again? Surely I’m the only one who just yelled at their partner and stormed out of the house, locking themselves out in the process? Surely I’m the only one huddled amongst the crumbs on the kitchen floor, crying and hoping her kids won’t find her? Have you ever seen Nigella Lawson do that on her BBC Christmas special? Exactly.,All in all, things were shaping up to be pretty miserable. I’d fallen out with some of the people I loved most. I was tired of roller-coastering from crazy schemes and sleepless nights to depression and anxiety over and over again. I didn’t seem to get on with any of the medication I tried. And I couldn’t see how I was going to be able to hang in there if this was how life was going to be.,One day, despairing and lost, I found myself doing something I’d never done before. I started talking about how I felt with someone I barely knew. ,I didn’t mean to. If I’d thought about it in advance I would have stopped myself. I’d had experiences before of opening up to people and it going wrong - I wouldn’t have had the nerve to consciously risk that again, especially when I felt so bad. But I didn’t think - I just spoke and everything came flooding out. How I believed myself to be impossible to live with. How I was scared that I was unfit to bring up my children. How I was so very tired of it all.,It was then that the extraordinary thing happened.,The person I barely knew, who probably had lots of other more important things to do, listened. She didn’t judge or pity me. She let me speak until I’d said all I needed to say and then she told me about her experiences. She didn’t have a diagnosed mental health problem herself but she still understood about mood swings, about anxiety, about perfectionism, about all sorts of things. And yet she seemed really normal and lovely and not at all like me.,Something in the experience of letting myself be completely vulnerable, of being listened to and then confided in, changed everything. I felt accepted. And as I did so, something switched in my brain. For the first time I can remember, it occurred to me to accept myself.,Since then, life has felt very different. The mood swings still come and go, but what has changed is that now I’m a little kinder to myself. Being kinder has helped me to get stronger. And as I’ve grown stronger I’ve talked with more and more people and listened to their stories and realised that I’m not alone in experiencing the things I do. Which has meant that I’ve been able to accept myself a little more, and be little kinder and get stronger and on and on...,I’m lucky. I found someone to listen when I most needed it. But many don’t. Many are right now feeling isolated and scared to reach out for help because mental health issues are still so difficult to admit to.,For that reason, I have promised myself that I will do everything I can to work towards a society in which we can all speak openly without fear of discrimination. A society in which it is as easy to ask for help for mental health problems as it is to get a broken arm fixed. ,I’ve started a project called , which is bringing together thousands of people from around the world. We’ve made a single and a music video to raise money for charities including Mind (one of the two mental health charities who run Time to Change), and we’re getting people talking about mental health issues. If you go to the ,, you can watch our video and see how that one small but extraordinary moment of kindness has made a big difference, not just in my life, but now in many others’ lives too."
,"I was following ,, having been impressed by the television campaigns and felt it had a valuable message to convey. I felt I shared the same ideas about de-stigmatising mental health issues through talking and I was in a good position to contribute as someone who both experiences issues and works in mental health.,When it came to actually stepping forward for a magazine article I will admit I nearly chickened out. It came home to me that I would need to be more open to more people than I had before and suddenly my idea about speaking out made me feel a lot more vulnerable. This felt like a further step towards being more honest about my experiences - but did feel like a bit of a risk. I was worried, I suppose, about who might see it and what they might think and getting the right message across about myself as well as Time to Change. I was also concerned about the impact on the people closest to me, wondering if they would approve. ,In the end I decided to put my worries to one side and go ahead. I spoke to some of the key people in my life and found them supportive and encouraging - in fact it helped me to face saying a few things more explicitly than I normally would - owning my history a bit more openly. ,My anxieties about the process were unfounded too - Time to Change were tremendously supportive, offering all the help and advice I needed, the journalists seemed genuinely interested in my experiences and in representing them in a fair and positive light. I had a chance to go over the details once the article was written, correcting inaccuracies and ensuring I was happy with the message. The idea of a professional photographer coming to take the images was pretty scary, as I don’t much care for being photographed, but my Mum came along for support. The photographer was friendly so our anxieties and embarrassment were short lived and we had good fun taking pictures at home and in a local park. ,I am glad I went ahead with the article - I recognise that I will benefit from being more open with the people who know me, and by opening up about my experiences. Preparing and thinking about the article gave me the chance to look back over the way my issues developed, giving me some clearer insights and helping me to see some patterns I hadn’t noticed before - which is always helpful. However, my main rationale remains my wish to present a positive message about mental health, hoping that people might benefit by reading the article - feeling more able to speak out, or to listen to others."
,"A wind of change has breezed into my life – or should I say a hurricane.

Hitting my own fear of the open ocean head on, I'm using this challenge to raise awareness of the Time to Change campaign.,The campaign, run by mental health charities Mind and Rethink Mental Illness, is England’s biggest ever attempt to end the stigma and discrimination that faces people with mental health problems.

In fact, it has come as such a relief that I’ve decided I deserve a break… but a break with a very different therapeutic angle…,Despite doing very well at coping with stress, anxiety and depression all my life, I’ve decided to take a break from the stresses that increasingly fill our busy lives and flush my system with a good dose of real fear – the kind of fear you have to react to or get hurt, put other’s lives at risk or put your own life at risk.,There will be no room for my usual fears and anxieties amongst the roaring oceans, far out at sea, where intuition rules. The ability to analyse and ponder is all but banished by the challenges thrown up by the unpredictable sea and the exhaustion inflicted by the sleeping/working patterns of the yacht’s watch system. Goodbye stressful thoughts and worry. Hello scary sea!,I’ve always been very open about my mental health problems. I can’t remember ever feeling ashamed but I know there are people who do feel this and who find it difficult to be open about such matters. In my opinion, keeping things in only makes things worse. So I hope that my openness can help others feel that it is OK to be more open and by raising awareness as part of this challenge I can play a small part in creating a society that is more supportive and understanding of mental illness.,You can find out more about my epic journey, as well as read my own personal experiences and guides to anxiety, depression and Asperger Syndrome by visiting my website ,., "
,"I’m going to write a  series of blogs focusing on the  ""taboo"" behaviours associated with differing mental health disorders. No matter whether the behavior is public or private,. My main aim is to get things out in the open so people do not have to feel alone and experience guilt, shame and self-loathing during or after an episode of being unwell. Make no mistake these behaviours, if left in denial, can destroy lives.,Find out more about , on the Mind website.,Imagine you are a married man with 2 small children. You have been with your wife for 10 years. She had suffered bouts of depression and had experienced severe post-natal depression after the birth of your first child. As a precautionary measure the doctor had advised she take an anti-depressant leading up to and after the birth of your second.,Over a few months the wife you thought you knew so well gradually starts to become a seemingly different character. She is really energetic, enthusiastic about everything, throwing caution to the wind and you are happy. Slowly though you notice whereas she used to enjoy simple pleasures, being with her children, focusing on the job she loves and being a mum she becomes bored with everything and wants to go and do what you might consider reckless activities. ,She then starts to become obsessed with going out in the evening, hanging out with a younger party crowd, going to clubs. At work there is a 19-year-old lad on work placement. You and your wife are 32. He is deeply troubled, fresh from a young offenders institution, previously in care covered in tattoos. Your wife has always maintained strong ethical professional yet starts to take it upon herself to become his best friend. She goes out wearing a sexy low-cut outfits and informs you she is taking the work placement lad out clubbing as he doesn’t know anybody to go out with in the city you live in.,Ok, now imagine you are the wife. You are as high as a kite.
The connection with this 19 year old has become like a drug, an addiction,
passionate and deeply unhealthy. You believe you are madly in love. You are a
woman again. You have a tremendous sex drive after not feeling any passion for
years: the riskier the better. You are lying to everyone but you don’t care. He
is fuelling your “out of character” forceful passion.  Even when the abuse starts it feeds your existential
need to be punished. I am “bad” this is what I deserve, so you welcome it in a
sick way.,You are now feeling out of control. Your friends are
starting to notice. Everyone is telling you that you must be crazy. You make
them lie for you so you can spend more time with your lover. You are inevitably
found out. Your husband just doesn’t understand and is deeply, deeply hurt, but
you can’t feel any remorse. You are whizzing along watching your actions as if
in a film and are totally removed from the destruction you are causing.,I was the wife in that story. I was experiencing my first
episode of mania, which was brought on by postnatal hormonal changes and was
ironically enhanced by the anti-depressants the doctor had prescribed.,Within 18 months of my daughter being born I had moved in
with this 20 year old who seemed to be a who seemed to be a criminal sociopath,
leaving my best friend and loved husband, my business, my home, and most
tragically my much loved children.,My ex-husbands voice kept echoing round my head, “you have
to be responsible for your actions, it was your choice.”,“But I couldn’t stop, “ I would be screaming inside.,Was I responsible? ,Many people I know who have experienced this phenomenon of
hyper sexuality describe the point in retrospect where it all starts to go
horribly wrong. We end up subconsciously seeking out people who won’t judge us,
but the truth is people who “don’t judge in this regard“ are normally extremely
psychologically damaged themselves. Those that do judge we tend to leave behind
or lie to so as to protect them.,My close friends and family didn’t know the half of it but
were really worried I was being manipulated and abused by the man I was with. I
thought I deserved it. By now my self-esteem was so low.,He was arrested 3 times for violent offences; I was locked
up over night too as I was trying to break down a door to a room he had locked
himself in, after he had cheated on me for the umpteenth time. I was locked in
a spiral of destruction.,The domestic violence team started supporting me and trying
to get me to throw him out. It took 6 years to get this man out of my life and,
until that time, I lost my house, developed a drink problem, and became
bankrupt by the age of 39. I was still not diagnosed bipolar until I was 43.,We all know and recognize how it is to feel sad, happy,
high, excited, anxious, or even “horny” and in the mood for love. These moods
keep us going, and in many ways protect us from certain situations, or let us
know what we are feeling so we can assess aspects of our lives and ourselves.
The reality is that we don’t have to act on how we feel. Feelings and moods are
not there to control us.,Many of us have even taken substances which alter our moods
and behaviours: alcohol, tea, coffee, recreational drugs, cannabis etc. all act
on our brain chemicals to make us feel different.,Hormones also have an effect on our moods. A mood disorder
is simply caused by an imbalance in the brain chemistry that regulates these
moods. A person who is bipolar or cyclothymiacs experiences mood swings either
in long episodes or in short episodes. We can swing from low, (various degrees
of depression,) to high, (hyper-mania or full blown mania.),Classic behaviours associated with the ""highs"" are
risky and self-destructive behaviour, which can include hyper sexuality.,Friends of mine who have also experienced the effect of
hyper sexuality seem to have experienced either an intense affair with someone
who fuels the mania, or they have experienced a complete change in their normal
sexual behavior.,There are people who have high sex drives or enjoy being
hedonistic and are perfectly healthy as it is part of their temperament or
character. They make informed choices. The thing to watch out for is when
someone starts to do things compulsively or totally out of character.,If my family and close friends understood how hormonal
changes can affect moods, not only plunging you into low moods, but also high,
would all this hurt and destruction have been avoided? Our sex-life is not
something we generally discuss with our family.,If I had known what was going on would I have been far more
able to ask for help? Hypersexual behaviour is far more acceptable in men, than
women, and does this add to women’s self-hatred? Are we as bipolar people now
lumbered with this fear of our own sexuality, not knowing who we really are in
that regard?, Many people simply concede that celibacy; no sex-drive or no
consistent healthy sexuality is the price we pay to stay “balanced.”  We accept and slightly welcome that the
medication we need gets rid of our sex drive. However we then feel constant
guilt in our relationships, guilt at not being able to fulfill our partner’s
need. However much you love your partner and understand the situation would you
give up sex?,Find out more about , on the Mind website."

The documentary captures moments of paralysing self doubt, ,and unhappiness for Freddie.

Vinnie Jones is particularly revealing, as he felt so differently from the professional hard man image he projected. He talks about feeling suicidal, about planning to take his own life and about how he had to hide his feelings in the dressing room.,Professional athletes... can get injured physically, or ill mentally, just like anyone else,""People playing professional sport, representing their country, have no right to be depressed."" That’s a ludicrous view, but until I experienced depression, that’s what I thought. Professional athletes are people, with strengths and weaknesses, and can get injured physically, or ill mentally, just like anyone else. And this comes across really strongly in the film. It’s a powerful, and important, message - because sport and professional athletes have an incredibly high profile in the UK, particularly in 2012.,
My breakdown came really suddenly. In retrospect there were warning signs in the few weeks before.  But the first I knew was when I started crying one morning. And I couldn’t stop. It took about an hour before I could set off for work, and then I only made it about 100 yards before I started crying again.,That was the start of the worst six months of my life,That was the start of the worst six months of my life; I couldn’t make the simplest of decisions, like what to eat for lunch, or what socks to wear. The smallest obstacles became a massive source of stress and anxiety. As a result, I found it hard to get out of bed, hard to leave the house. Talking to people and socialising became almost painful. I had suicidal thoughts every day. It was made worse by the shame of having to go to the doctors for sick notes, of having to explain to my boss why I couldn’t come back to work, of friends and family seeing me in such a condition, and knowing the distress I was causing them.,
The shame that I felt, the embarrassment at not being ‘strong enough’ is really common, particularly among men. Time to Change have done ,. It showed that for most people, the stigma of mental illness – worrying about what others think, worrying about people judging you, feeling shame at being so weak – often has a larger impact than the mental health problems.,We don’t treat mental health problems in the same way that we do physical injuries,We don’t treat mental health problems in the same way that we do physical injuries, so it becomes a source of shame. No-one feels guilty about saying they have a broken arm or twisted ankle, but mental health carries huge stigma with it. And that’s why documentaries like this are hugely important.,Marcus Trescothick was one of Flintoff’s team mates, another 2005 Ashes cricketer who experienced depression. He’s not featured in this film, but his autobiography includes a brutally frank, raw account of multiple breakdowns and recovery. I read it during my depression. Discovering that someone who I admired, someone who had the mental strength to dominate international sport, felt as low as I did was a real help and source of comfort to me. I didn’t feel so weak and that was an important part of my recovery.,Hopefully Flintoff’s film can help normalise mental health,Hopefully Flintoff’s film can help normalise mental health, get it out in the open, and help people feel able to talk about it. There’s a real momentum within mental health in sport at the moment: Footballer Neil Lennon was interviewed in the film, and experienced depression as a player. As Celtic manager, he’s been able to talk to young players, helping them to think about mental problems as they would a physical injury.,When Michael Yardy returned from the 2011 World Cup with depression, the England Cricket Board felt able to be open about it – Tresothick’s return five years earlier had been blamed on a fictitious virus. Jonny Wilkinson is probably England rugby union’s highest profile player of the last decade and in November disclosed his years experiencing depression, panic attacks, anxiety and self harm.,
This kind of honesty and openness can really help make life easier for the millions of people with mental health problems. So encourage people to watch the documentary and try to start the conversation about mental health."
,"It all
came to a head in 2005, when after choosing to ignore the growing pain in my groin,
I found out that I had retorn everything that had been repaired in my first
groin operation five years ago. On top of that I had torn a big part of my
adductor muscle and needed another hernia repair operation plus a tenotomy,
which involved cutting the adductor cleanly so that it can reheal perfectly.
After the operation I started training again but as soon as I tried any
sideways or unpredictable movements, I could feel the groin starting to tear
slightly and would have to wait for it to heal before I could train again. And
so the cycle began and I found this desperately frustrating. ,Suddenly
I then found myself fit enough to kick again but I was so desperate to get it
right, so driven by the annoyance and fear of not getting it perfect, that the
anger I felt inside began to express itself physically. I didn’t know what it
was, but my frustration was so intense that I started shouting at the walls,
screaming obscenities. I also punished myself for my mistakes too. When my left
foot let me down, I stamped down hard on it. At one stage, I was so livid that,
before I knew it, I was sinking my teeth into my hand, trying to bite through
the skin between my thumb and index finger. It immediately started to bruise
and the pain was intense.,I had
experienced frustration like this before. I remember one time after training
going up to the nearby Slaley Hall Hotel to use their pool. Usually I use the
pool to relax physically. This time, I made sure that no one else was around,
lowered myself into the water until I was completely submerged, and then I let
out a scream of total frustration. I came up for air and then submerged myself
again and screamed again. No words, just pure desperation. I carried on
screaming as long and as loud as I could and I didn’t stop until I was hoarse.
I simply could not find any other way of dealing with this non-stop barrage of
thoughts and negativity.,Eventually,
I got to a point where I felt I couldn’t escape. There was simply no way I
could concentrate enough to even read a book. My mind was totally preoccupied
with anything it could find that was negative and destructive; and it caused me
to feel panic and my heart to beat quicker. My obsessiveness had vacated rugby
completely and started to drive my thoughts downwards, tossing endless dark,
nasty images through my head.,I’d
been working closely with the Newcastle
doctor, Graeme Wilkes, on my physical injuries and this one occasion I went and
visited him again but this time I let it all go. I didn’t talk to him about my
groin, I told him about my head. Graeme is a fantastic guy, a very good doctor
and the right person to be saying this to. He said what I realised I needed to
hear, that I have an illness. It’s like any other injury but this one is in my
head rather than in my leg or my arm or anywhere else. He was very, very good
to me. He explained that my illness was controlling everything else and working
on the groin injury was far secondary to sorting out my head. There was no
point in my groin getting better if I didn’t sort out my head anyway, because
that issue was much more severe.,Merely
to know that I have an illness that is not abnormal was like a first weight off
my shoulders. I was initially referred to a specialist, but the connection
wasn’t quite right. I needed to feel completely comfortable to deal with this.
Not long afterwards, I was at a dinner in London
and in the midst of the evening I found myself in deep conversation with
another player, whom I have known for a long time. I was acutely aware of what was
happening to me and was on the brink of sharing my story with people, putting
little feelers out in conversation. When I mentioned that I was struggling a
bit to this player, the door swung open. He then went on to tell me he had
massive problems too. He told me his story and I latched on to every detail. I
feel great respect for him, to know that he has dealt with this for so much
longer than I have. So I told him my story, and he gave me the telephone number
of an American therapist. He tells me that this guy is a great guy, funny but
engaging. For me, he said, it really worked so just try it. And that’s how I
started."
," ,It’s taken me a long time to accept that bi-polar II and previous mental health problems (agoraphobia, anxiety, depression, eating disorders) are not only part of my life but they’re also a part of who I am – and that’s OK. However, just over a year ago I experienced such terrible discrimination from someone who I thought was a friend that I had to leave my job and due to the stress of it all I ended up in hospital. I was petrifies that if other people I knew found out for the first time similar experiences would happen again. How wrong was I!,Talking to different people and hearing their positive opinions and some of their own experiences gave me a new found confidence and self-assurance. When I saw people I knew who were out shopping I actually began to quickly go over to them before they ‘’got away’’. It was so liberating to discuss mental health issues with them and to tell them about my experiences!  Some talked about their own mental health difficulties which I hadn’t known about. Others were shocked, but instead of being negative they offered support if I ever needed it. It seen them since the roadshow and there’s been no change in how they act around me.,The main aim of encouraging people to talk about mental health went really well. Scratch cards were very population in getting people to stop and talk – once I had guaranteed that I didn’t want a single penny from them. Some people even came back later on bring friends to show them what we were doing. The mini-plays and free tea and coffee were also very popular including with myself. After a day of bouncing around (not a requirement!) I was tired but so happy that I rang lots of friends to tell them how it went.,I am still so please to have seen such a positive response from people in Exeter.  Hopefully the hard work of everyone volunteering will have made some difference to people who experience mental health difficulties now or in the future.  However, I seem to have slipped back into some of my ‘’older ways’’. I’m not as open with people as I was that day. Part of this is probably is a ‘safety in numbers’ thing but I guess the other part of me still worries about discrimination and the effect that could have on me again. I’ve realise that while the roadshow was great it’s just one step in raising awareness and tackling discrimination. There are so many more steps to go and I’m so glad to hear that Time To Change has received more funding to continue with this. I will definitely be volunteering in any way I can along this journey!"
," ,I thought my life was over. I was housebound for over two years- I stopped washing, shaving, taking care of myself. I totally cut off all contact with friends and my wider family. I often told my parents  that I wanted to die because the pain was so relentless that I just wished for a release from it. I have reached double figures for medications, tried various therapies and spent time in a day hospital, all of which have had varying degrees of success but none provided that magic solution which I so longed for.,I find looking back that what helped me most in terms of treatment was not a particular school of therapy or the cult-like ethos of a hospital, it was talking to and connecting with other human beings. I found my way to therapists and a psychiatrist who had vast experience but crucially, did not treat me like a diagnosis or test case. I was able to learn about my diagnoses and probe and be sceptical of those who gave them to me,I don't want to imply that I have recovered solely through some good healthcare professionals, not to mention my incredibly supportive family. In fact, I don't want to imply that I have “recovered” at all. I still feel my symptoms with me much of each day but there is progress, no matter how slow.  ,Since I got my Cocker Spaniel Milo two years ago it has forced me out of the house every day. Knowing that he needs a walk and that it's my responsibility to give him one takes me out of whatever stuff I'm going through. It has also forced me to redevelop my social skills by talking to other dog-owners and people in the park.,Another thing that has led to a shift in my life is ,. Writing the book, which is partly based on my own experiences of mental illness and the mental health system, helped me to express some of the things that had been trapped up in my head for so long. The last few months have involved a book launch  and discussion, being interviewed by a newspaper, enlisting authors and journalists to review the book, and various other surreal things which I wouldn't have believed I could have coped with even a few months ago.,I think the common thread between my dog and my book, apart from their importance to me personally, is that they have acted as 'enablers.' Both are good conversation-starters for a person who has lost his friends and whose conversation skills had ossified. Milo is daft as a brush and full of life which has helped me to build relationships with people by making him the main focus. The book has allowed me to talk openly about my mental illness in a way that I couldn't have when I felt the stigma so strongly early on, as much from myself as from others.,I am so glad that Time to Change is focussed specifically on the issue of stigma in mental illness. It would be easy for me, as someone who now personally understands mental illness, to castigate those who stigmatise it. But that would be hypocritical because before I got ill I had no idea how serious mental illness was even though people in my family had suffered from it. I'm sure I used terms like 'mental' or 'schizo' when I was at school because most kids did. The fundamental issue of stigma is exclusion. Human history is littered with tales of majorities of societies, usually out of their own fears or insecurity, categorising minority groups who were, or were said to be, different. It seems that mental illness is one of the few remaining areas where this is, if not acceptable, then certainly tacitly allowed.,It is our job to remind society that ignorance is no longer an option. Rates of mental illness in the UK are so frighteningly high that sufferers are no longer a small subsection of society, almost every person in this land has either had a mental illness or knows someone who has. I fully agree that it's Time to Change, and not just in my life but in our society."
,"For years when I lived at home my parents would try to convince me there was nothing wrong with me and that it was just a phase that would pass on its own. My feelings, issues and anxieties were brushed under the carpet, this made me feel like I was doing something wrong by feeling hopeless. I felt that it was my fault.  I wanted to die and my parents would tell me to “pick myself up” and “not be so sensitive about things”. They did not even like using the word “depression” and would tell me that the GP was wrong with his diagnosis.,I was unable to access mental health services until I had left home, as my dad was particularly worried that “people” would find out about my mental health problem (my parents were both working for the NHS at the time). I was not allowed to tell other relatives, other than my immediate family, so when I was feeling too low to leave the house my parents would always make other excuses for me. I think some of my relatives could tell these were just excuses, as a result I am now quite distant and detached from most of them.,In a way, my parents unwittingly taught me to hide my mental health problems, that they were a defect to be ashamed of.,
I understand now that this sort of reaction is unfortunately common, especially among Asian families like mine. As with a lot of Asian families, feelings and moods were not really discussed and any sort of display of emotion was seen as a form of weakness.My parents attitude towards my depression made me feel like I had cast a dark shadow over the family and this caused to me feel a lot of guilt.,Over time, my parents’ attitudes changed. They have learnt a lot about many aspects of mental health.  Now they are brilliant, supportive and understanding.  Both of my parents have an active interest in campaigns such as “Time to Change” - a programme led by the charities Mind and Rethink Mental Illness, to tackle the stigma and discrimination surrounding mental health.,Now, we can all talk openly about everything, my symptoms, medication and treatment which is really useful for all of us.  My parents understand my behaviour, that sometimes I will be anxious, quiet and withdrawn, they accept me for who I am and don’t put pressure on me.,My family and I wish we could change the past, as we now realise how important it is to have the support of ones family during hard times. It took me a long time to realise that depression is nothing to be ashamed about. Although now I sometimes forget that there are still people to whom mental illness is still a taboo subject, especially when I just drop it into conversations  (sometimes you can see people look uncomfortable, as if you’ve just announced you’re growing a tail!).  But I figure, that is their problem, not mine!"
,"As with most types of prejudice, the discrimination surrounding mental health is largely born out of ignorance. There is a huge lack of education for adults, young people and children around the subject, regardless of the fact that one in four people will or have experienced a mental health problem in their lifetime. Even though illnesses such as depression and anxiety disorders are becoming a little more accepted, severe mental health problems are still very much taboo.,The awareness that the Time to change campaign is bringing to people is so very valuable, not only to  those directly affected by mental health but to society as a whole. I was a carer to a person with severe mental health problems when I was a teenager, for my ex boyfriend. He suffered from schizophrenia and I was his main source of support. He experienced stigma and discrimination because of his illness from the very beginning. Most of his friends deserted him as soon as they found out he had been sectioned. I guess those young boys had no education or experience of mental health and perhaps out of fear of the unknown wanted nothing more to do with him even though he had known some of them for years. Luckily one friend did stick by him and I will always be grateful for that.,The reason why I was my ex boyfriend’s main carer (with the help of my parents) is because his own family showed him little support. He had already been thrown out by his mother at 17 and it was only a year or so after this that he became ill. He had never had a relationship with his father and his mother supported him at the absoloute minimum. After the first time he was sectioned for 48 hours and then sent home, my dad suggested to his mother he should go and stay with her for a couple of nights. She out right refused to let him stay even for a night, giving the reason for this, ‘as it would be dangerous for her other children’. His mother was happy for us to take full responsibility for his care until we broke up, then she started to support him ever so slightly but would never let him stay at her house. The news soon spread around the town, and soon enough most people he knew wouldn’t even say hello if they passed him in the street.,I even experienced some stigma myself as I felt few of my peers could relate to what I was going through. Like most teenagers their life consisted of studying and partying, not caring for someone who was severely mentally ill and visiting secure psychiatric wards. I felt very uncomfortable sharing what I was going through with people and I also felt some negativity from people in the area, which began to give me the idea that perhaps people thought it was , fault my ex boyfriend was ill, as if I’d driven him to it. I felt so isolated and hardly saw my friends for over a year and when I did see them I couldn’t enjoy myself much as I was constantly worrying about my boyfriend.,However through all this, I was lucky enough to have extremely supportive parents, and as my dad is a mental health professional, he told me so much about the mental health system and gave me great reassurance that just because my ex boyfriend was so unwell, this by no means meant that he would become dangerous and if he by any chance did, the person who he would most likely be a danger to was himself.,It scares me to wonder what might have happened to my ex boyfriend and myself if we hadn’t have had the support and education from my parents and Time to Change about mental health. If I hadn’t had that support, I wouldn’t have been able to support him and then he really , have been left alone with both the stigma and the illness."
,"“If you saw me back then, you’d have thought I had everything: a job as a fashion photographer, money, mates. I was a bit of a jack the lad – or that’s the image I projected to the world. But that was only half the story – I had been diagnosed with chronic depression as a teenager and had coped with it in silence as I didn’t want to be labelled.,Then I had a breakdown. It wasn’t dramatic, but manifested itself gradually over time until eventually I became a prisoner in my own home. I felt unable to speak to anyone, isolated and suicidal.,
I ended up seeing a counsellor who asked me about my interests. I told him about how I enjoyed football and keeping fit, and it’s at this point that my life changed. I was encouraged to join a football project for men with mental health problems. At first I was a bit nervous about going – I didn’t want to be around a bunch of ‘nutcases’. But in those two-hour football sessions I was able to be myself for the first time. I didn’t have to pretend to be OK. I could just be me. I was proud to admit ‘I’m Jason and I have a mental health problem.’ On the pitch I could lose my temper and shout and scream,
– it was good for letting go of some of the tension.,
It’s not for everyone but it worked for me. When I started feeling better, I became an ambassador and started talking about my experience, to help change people’s perceptions of mental illness.,The football project has given me a second chance. I went from being a service user to being a coach, and now I run the project at Arsenal. I use football as a way of maintaining my own mental wellbeing and helping others, and feel I’ve been given a great opportunity to do something positive.”"
,"“I use Twitter as a way of being in touch with people who share similar interests, people who entertain me, campaigns or issues that interest me and celebrities I find interesting. I have been a regular user of Twitter for over two years now.,I saw the #befrank hashtag being used by someone I follow on Tuesday 19 April. I clicked on it and was moved by what I saw. I was prompted to share: ,It felt scary doing this, as I don't really open up much to people about my mental health problems. I find it easier to support and help people with their own problems than seek support for my own.,I got positive responses from this post, mainly from people congratulating me for speaking out.  This gave me the courage to post again the next day that I wasn't feeling too good. Again the responses were positive from Twitter friends.,I found it much easier to use Twitter to post these rather than talking in 'real life' because of the anonymity offered.  I do not use Twitter as a daily outlet for my mental health status, rather as a means of support if things are getting too much. Or indeed to share the good days.”"
," ,I have had a long history of mental health illness. I was diagnosed with depression in the early-1990s, when I was at university, and have been prescribed anti-depressants for most of my adult life. When I first told my close friends about my diagnosis, they reacted with disbelief and urged me not to take my prescription. I was popular and successful academically and I don’t think I fitted their ideas of someone with mental health difficulty.,Largely due to self stigma, I went on to choose to conceal my mental health illness. I did not disclose it when I applied for jobs and I certainly never told anyone apart from very close friends. Once, I spent a plane trip with a company director who I particularly respected and we somehow got onto the topic of depression. She simply disbelieved that any such condition existed, commenting that sometimes she felt really down herself but that she pulled herself together. I have no idea whether what she was describing was some sort of depression or not but it was with excruciating discomfort that I listened as she continued with her spiel at some length.,Surprisingly, it was being sectioned while experiencing an episode of psychotic mania, perhaps one of the most stigmatised of all mental health illnesses, that turned the tables in terms of me opening up about my condition. I started writing about my psychotic experience as a form of self-therapy and I went on to publish my work – my e-book ‘,’ is now available from Chipmunka Publishing. ,As part of the book writing and marketing process, I have been open about my experience and have talked about my psychotic episode using social media like Facebook and Twitter. I have been amazed by the response I have had with numerous friends telling me that they too have had mental illnesses. ,One sticky issue for me has been what to tell potential employers. Under the Equality Act 2010, it is no longer possible for employers to ask about disabilities in pre-employment health questionnaires before offering a job. This is good news since most of people feel that disclosing a mental health problem could damage their career. One in five workers told Mind that they feared losing their job if they were open about a mental health issue at work. I currently work for myself but if I was applying for a job I feel that I probably , disclose as I would want to talk about my book as a significant achievement and I could not do that without revealing that I had experienced psychosis.,Social contact—direct, personal contact between people , experience of mental illness and people , mental health problems—is one of the most promising strategies for reducing stigma and discrimination. As part of my research for this blog, I asked my close friends whether witnessing me go through a severe mental health problem had affected their perceptions of mental health in any way. My friends all said that it had improved their insight. One told me that what she’d seen me go through had challenged her previous perception of mental health problems being permanent because I had proved to her that recovery was possible. “I’d thought before that a mental health problem was a label that stuck,” she said.,My broadcasting-style approach isn’t for everyone but I would like to pass on the message that for me opening up has been an enormously positive experience."

Sue Baker, Director of Time to Change, has rightly spoken out about Mr Gallagher’s remarks, as ,. Anyone, particularly someone in the public eye, deserves the utmost respect for talking about their mental health problems and helping to raise awareness of something that still carries the burdens of stigma and misunderstanding.,
Reading this reminded me of lads at my school who called me a ‘failure’ because I wasn’t particularly good at sports and didn’t have a girlfriend. I could give them the benefit of the doubt and remember them as youthful scamps who meant no harm and it was all a bit of a joke. Or I could think about how it felt to be a teenage boy with low self-esteem, being repeatedly told he was a failure by boys (usually three of them together) who were more confident (at least when they were in their trio) and seemingly more popular.,
When I had counselling for my depression, that phrase ‘Brook’s a failure’ was one of the first things that came to mind when I was thinking what might have caused me to have such unreasonably high standards for myself. I felt I always had to excel at everything, and nothing less than perfect was good enough. Was this subconsciously driven by an urge to prove those boys wrong? , is exploring the consequences of name-calling in the longer term. I wonder how often bullying is linked to mental illness…,
Anyway – and I’m far from a failure, by the way, but if you ever meet me please remind me of that fact – what Liam Gallagher said about Adam Ant was rather like those playground taunts. I’m sure Adam Ant can stand up for himself, but I’m equally sure that the tide needs to turn against those who mock someone who has the courage to talk openly about their illness, particularly in a world where many men still think that macho posturing is what makes a chap a ‘real man’.,
One way this can happen is for male role models to speak out about their experiences of mental illness, so I was delighted to see that World Cup-winning rugby star , has done just that in his autobiography. Other sporting heroes like boxer Frank Bruno have done the same.,
Both are champions in sports for ‘real men’. They’re strong. They are winners. And, more importantly for me, they have highlighted the fact that depression and other mental illnesses are indeed illnesses and can affect anyone. Having a mental illness is not a character flaw; not a weakness; not a failing; not confirmation that someone ‘can’t take it’ or ‘isn’t man enough’; and not ‘nutty’.,
A man who’s prepared to admit he is mentally ill and share his experiences openly – now that’s what I call a real man."
,"""Facing up to Australia's fast bowlers was nothing compared to facing up to my depression."",When Marcus Trescothick flew home early during two overseas England cricket tours his reasons were somewhat of a mystery. ,It was not until 2008, when Marcus announced his retirement, that the truth finally came out, he had been experiencing clinical depression. “It was a huge and extremely difficult step to actually admit that I was suffering from a mental health problem."" But by talking about his mental health Marcus helped to confront the myth that mental health problems are something to be ashamed of and to hide. ,Being able to talk about mental health is important for us all.

,"I have swine flu, AND whilst I'm more than happy to receive your messages of sympathy I'm wallowing in a vat of self pity the size of the Watford Gap which is hardly admirable, thus I hardly deserve your kind words. (grin),I'm blogging this because I fell into a diagnostic trap - a self diagnostic trap actually. When I began to feel unwell it started as fatigue and I felt a low and automatically fell into thinking I was falling into depression, I didn't even consider that there may be a physical reason! This is something we all hear about when GP's and Psychiatrists write off physical illness as symptomatic of our Mental Health diagnosis and simply do not investigate further. I think we can all see how this occurs, since we are most likely to attend a GP because of our mental health if we have a diagnosis, and some physical conditions can hide within the symptoms of a mental illness, such as palpitations, chest pain, aches, fatigue and a whole host of other conditions which may well have more sinister underlying physical reasons for being present.,""It's a shocking fact that people with severe mental illness die 10 years younger than other people because of poor physical health. This can change - if the Government and health trusts take effective action."" (RETHINK),Sudden death from cardiovascular disease is considerably higher in people with a mental health diagnosis such as schizophrenia and bi-polar disorder. Instances of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C infection are emerging problems affecting people with long-term mental illness, and tuberculosis is more prevalent, possibly due to lifestyle and reduced immunity, and it's also been reported that people with schizophrenia may well have a higher 'pain threshold' making them less likely to attend the GP until something is particularly serious. There are also issues around communication, the actual process of physical examination for some patients all of which contribute to our not receiving the best psychical health care.,In conclusion what can WE do? I think first and foremost not fall into the self diagnostic, self-medicating trap which I am guilty of falling into this past week would be a start. I know that it is hard to discern whether I'm tired because I am physically ill or mentally unwell, but I now know I shouldn't merely assume the latter and become blase.,The change really begins with our Carer's psychiatric teams and the people supporting us to place pressure upon GP's to perform regular health checks.,""Annual health checks and providing the same level of health promotion/prevention support as received by the general population could make a significant contribution to the reduction of health inequalities"" (SAINSBURYS CENTRE FOR MENTAL HEALTH).,Start now by checking out RETHINK'S Physical Health Campaign,,http://www.rethink.org/how_we_can_help/campaigning_for_change/opening_doors/physical_health/index.html,Looking after ourselves is key to maintaining our long term well being and extending our lives and we shouldn't become complacent.,So here's to Mental and Physical Wealth!

,"Ulrika Jonsson has experienced depression and panic attacks on a few occasions in her life.,“Despite having bright, wonderful children and a house I can call my own, I found myself in some real low points. I didn't want to wake up in the mornings, I found it so hard to cope."",Instead of taking antidepressants she chose to deal with the depression herself.,“There were tears, but most of the time I was miserable, distracted and disillusioned. There were times when I simply didn't want to go on. Depression grips the mind and the heart in a desperately unforgiving way, life is one long unbearable situation."",Ulrika took the decision to open up about her experiences to help educate people about mental health issues. She wanted to encourage others with their own experiences of mental health problems and let them know it's ok to be honest about your mental health.,“When you are diagnosed with a mental health problem, it is so easy to want to keep it a secret from everyone, even friends and family. But I'm thankful that I found the courage to go public. I hope that by speaking out in the media, I can help combat the stigma experienced by so many."",Ulrika is back on fighting form.Through living an active healthy lifestyle and with the support of her friends and family, she manages her condition and keeps herself in good health. "
,"Here's a piece of information which might make one or two recoil in shock. For the most part you couldn't spot a depressive from any other member of society; you might need to get very close to someone before it became apparent.,Sadly getting close to someone for long enough for them to realise that periods of depressive illness are not something the sufferer has any control over, Close enough to realise that the sufferer is not trying to make them feel uncomfortable and that the behaviour they are subject to is not a personal attack on them is extremely difficult.,Those of you, who glanced over my previous blog on gaining employment as a sufferer of mental illness, will be aware of the dilemma we face when approaching an employer first up. Do I or don't I divulge the nature and extent of my illness? Well for the purposes of this blog, for employer read partner.,If finding employment is tricky (and that's something of an understatement) becoming involved in a long term relationship and hanging on to it is a task of mammoth proportions. There you are on the crest of a wave, enjoying an extended period of good mental health, you meet someone, and you like them, they like you, hell you may even have fallen in love. You've thought about your situation at some length and you have decided honesty is the best policy. It's what all female oriented magazines say when you've browsed through them in the doctors' waiting room, what all the Sunday magazines tell you, what all the agony aunts recommend. Women like honesty, they respect honesty and openness and will give you credit for sharing something about yourself. Well that might be the case for some women, but guys don't count on it. I'm sure men are the same, no in fact they are probably worse ;( most men think a woman who calls the day following a date is slightly obsessive and possessive!) But my experiences with women so that's the perspective I have.,A while back, I met someone, she was fantastic, and we dated and fell in love very, very quickly. It was a whirlwind but I found the time before it all took off and got out of control to tell her of my illness. She was very understanding and in spite of my doubts about whether or not she would be as understanding if, and I suspected when, the depression returned I carried on enjoying the moment, the feeling of having someone there who loved and understood me. This continued for about six months after four months I moved in with her, gave up my flat and threw my all into the relationship. Then one Friday night it all came to a head, I had been feeling a little low (I thought) and my partner challenged me about the way I had been behaving, I tried to explain that this is part and parcel of the condition but the atmosphere remained tense and turned into a full blown argument the following morning. We patched things up but from then on things were never the same again. This situation culminated in her telling me she needed some space and asked me to move out. My head just closed down. I thought it was all over and in my depressed and confused state I took an overdose with alcohol (which I never touch) I was taken to hospital and had my stomach pumped. On discharge I stayed with my parents and though we tried to make another go of the relationship, ultimately my partner could not deal with the prospect of this occurring again.,I was left shattered and as low as I have ever been, I'm still not sure I will ever trust anyone properly ever again which means that I may never properly love again and that's a thought which would drive the so-called “sane"" to madness. This experience has certainly made me question being so honest and open about my illness, although working with TTC a little has made my illness a good deal less of a secret. Which I am choosing to see as a good thing, if people know from the outset what they are taking on then perhaps they will more carefully consider engaging with me in the first place. "
,"Steady family, good career and no more money worries than most people, but none of this has stopped me falling victim to depression.,Well, if I'm gonna be writing a blog you'll want to know a bit about me and why I want to do it I guess. First the why - I'm fed up with saying I'm OK when people ask. It doesn't help me, or those around me. If people ask me something about my illness I'll tell them the truth and in doing that I hope to give people an insight and some understanding. Don't get me wrong, it's not been easy to do it, but it's gotten easier. Here you go, here's my story.,I am a serving firefighter in Greater Manchester, married for over 20 years and have two sons aged 17 & 15. I have suffered with depression for approximately 15 years, though I've only had medical intervention in the last six. Five years ago I tried to commit suicide, which resulted in me being admitted to a psychiatric unit for several weeks, and I returned to work after a few months. I was discharged from mental health services approximately six months after that.,Over the following four years I have battled with my depression and just about kept my head above water. I've either been on medication, going on medication or coming off it. Some months ago I was looking at coming off medication - as it happened I didn't, and within a couple of months I had started to slide again. I was at a point that I knew I needed help, I didn't know what sort of help I just needed something. Even though I'd been involved with mental health services I had no idea where to turn for help other than my GP. So off I went for my appointment, my medication was increased and I was referred to community mental health - but was told it would be a 3-4 month wait. I didn't need help in three months I needed it NOW. I was ever-so-slowly sinking.,I went to my occupational health, hoping to shortcut the system and get myself some help. This was when I told the lads that I worked with that I was struggling. They didn't have a clue and were supportive even though they didn't understand. At my next appointment with the GP, I saw a different doctor and the decision was made to keep my medication the same, and have another look in a month. I had to recount my medical history again, including the fact that I had previously had a failed suicide attempt. As I left I was told that, because I was married and had children, there was statistically very little chance I would attempt suicide. Which bit of “I've already attempted to kill myself"" did they not understand?,Up until this point I was still working. Outside work, I suppose I just existed. I had some CBT authorised through work. I had a couple of sessions before my life imploded. I didn't last the month till my next appointment with the GP, I had got to the point that I would break down for no reason at all. I just couldn't go to work any longer.,This was when my depression took on a whole new life of its own. Things were now happening to me that I had never experienced and certainly didn't understand. It started one night when I was in the bath, all warm relaxing and bubbly. I shut my eyes and watched myself cut my wrists and lie there dying, it was like watching a DVD - once it finished it would replay again. I can't describe how scary that was.,From that day things just spiraled out of control. I think that was one of the things that most unsettled me, I now had no control. The visions then could strike at any time and now I didn't even have to shut my eyes to see myself hanging from a tree, jumping from a bridge, cutting my wrists. Not long after the first vision I would hear my own voice telling me to get on with it, as I was going to do it at some stage.,I now needed a sick note, so it was back to the GP. A different doctor, he phoned my wife and sent me straight down to A&E. There I was seen by the Crisis Home Resolution team. They started to visit me at home every couple of days. I saw a psychiatrist within a week and my medication was changed. The CHR team carried on visiting me over the next week. By Sunday, my life had completely fallen apart and they asked me to come in to hospital as an informal patient. I told my wife - she was devastated - I just couldn't go, I couldn't leave her.,There were lots of tears that day and when things calmed down a little, my wife told me that although me going into hospital would have been traumatic at any time, that day was exactly five years to the day since I was admitted last time. I'm a bloke you know, we're no good with dates - I had no idea. Sunday night was one of the worst in my life, the morning just couldn't come fast enough. I was asked to go in again, it wasn't even a question and I suppose Sunday had sort of prepared us for it.,That was me back in hospital five years and a day later. I'll recount my progress from there next time. But I'd like to leave you with these thoughts.,Everyone, most people anyway, jump to conclusions. In my case people think that I'm stressed or traumatized and become depressed because of the job I do. Nothing could be further from the truth. People think something has to go wrong in your life for you to become depressed. In my case, sometimes it just happens - it creeps up and gets me.,And a lot of people have no idea what suffering from depression is like, how do you describe it? Here is my best effort at describing it to one of the lads at work who loves football. Imagine your team playing the local rivals, ahead with minutes to go, you've got it in the bag, three points tucked away. In the final minute they equalize - gutted is normally the reaction. The referee adds extra time and guess what happens? Bang, they score and you've been beaten. The feeling you get when the ball hits the back of the net, that split-second of realization. Now take that split second and imagine feeling like that all the time."
," , It was very difficult to organise something for Get Moving as I work in a call centre, so getting people moving was going to be a problem. But I put up campaign posters, left leaflets in the canteen area, and did a question trail around the grounds so people could go for a walk on their break and answer questions about mental health., I did get a couple of negative comments from colleagues, such as ""Mental health, how depressing"", but more positively, a few people did come and talk to me about their own experiences of anxiety and depression, which made me realise I am not alone. We now talk regularly to see how each other is doing and give support if needed. It certainly gave me a small boost of self-confidence that people felt comfortable enough to talk to me about their experiences, and it has brought me to believe that giving people the opportunity to talk and share their feelings and experiences at events such as Get Moving is a valuable tool in the fight against mental health discrimination."""
,"Then came the news of , when he flew back from the World Cup, with the open support of his club and colleagues, and much – supportive – media comment.,Then I got talking to a BT engineer who came to my house, who said he lives with depression. ,The next day, I presented to BBC staff about the media and mental health – and afterwards, received lots of emails making personal connections, with people who had been in the audience telling me about their own experiences.  ,And I spent yesterday working on the airwaves with ,, who talked openly about how as a family they had supported each other during Frank’s breakdown eight years ago.,All these conversations that have happened over just seven days – and all the other conversations that they will hopefully have sparked – have shown that we can do a lot together just by talking about mental health more openly."
,"
Robert has had Bipolar Disorder since he was nineteen. His family desperately tried to help - but shame and embarrassment about mental illness always made talking difficult. He had depression for over a decade. And despairing of a normal existence, he nearly ended his life. 
,
After his family rallied around, Robert eventually got the right treatment - and he's now made a full recovery. Over the years, Robert has had to put up with discrimination because of the stigma surrounding mental illness. He's been rejected for job interviews, suffered bullying at work and is even barred from serving on a jury. But the worst thing has been people's ignorance and not feeling able to be open about his illness. 
,
Robert now works in Public Relations, he's married with a young family and enjoys a full and active life. He no longer wants to live a 'secret life', hiding his illness from people. As Robert says: ""Why should I be ashamed? Your mental health shouldn't be any different from a broken leg.""

,"In the 1990s during my A-Levels I developed ME/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome after three-weeks of type A or B influenza caused my immune system to collapse and never recover. I didn't get diagnosed for some years, so had to drop out of university, and suffered a “breakdown"" more properly known as a major depressive episode.,No-one noticed much at the day hospital that I was disappearing at meal times to eat at the staff canteen because I thought someone might poison the meals at the day hospital. At university, the clinical psychologist told me that the “gas chambers"" I was imagining as I showered in the middle of the night (because the ME caused total sleep reversal) were just a symptom of sleep deprivation.,I went back to college and did media studies and completed a journalism degree, though my health made this an uphill struggle and I only just made it through to gain a BA (Hons) 2.1 in Broadcast Journalism.,But it wasn't until several years later when discrimination in the workplace brought an end to my career in local radio that I was finally admitted to hospital suffering an acute psychotic episode after a long gradual increase in delusions and paranoia Ã¢â‚¬â€œ known to psychiatrists as a “prodrome""..,I had worked as a staff member at my local radio station for only half of my contract when the acting news editor decided that 5 hours a day wasn't enough and that she wanted me to get up at 4.30am, with ME, to read breakfast bulletins. We'd agreed five hour afternoon shifts to fit around my health. This was blatant discrimination, and when I complained, the news editor rang around other stations telling them I was suing for discrimination (which I wasn't, and didn't!) and so I had to go out of the area (an hour's drive away, with ME) for further work.,This was just the first taste of what was to come!,I had another depressive episode but managed to go freelance and enjoy three years of intermittent success. I applied for many jobs, mainly at larger radio stations, because of their sizeand the perception that they would be reputable and non-discriminatory.Working as a freelance gained me access to radio stations' internal websites, or “intranets"", where most jobs are advertised (internally, if at all). One recruitment department confirmed to me in an email that over a two-year period when I had approached my local station for work, no jobs were advertised, yet a young reporter was taken on.,It got worse. When I applied for a job at an international radio station as a trainee, with 6 places, my notes (obtained under the Data Protection Act) showed 100% scores at interview and assessment, and the last words were “enter intake"". “We were very impressed by your candidature."" said the rejection letter. Upon one of many national radio job applications I discovered from internal memos obtained under the Act that only one candidate had been short listed, and so understandably got the job. “I have chosen a recruitment path for this vacancy and do not intend to change that"" was the editor's reply to my email.,Ultimately a combination of poor recruitment practices in the media and discrimination in the industry became so apparent that I took professional careers advice and also sought extensive feedback from each job interview. Generally, I would be short listed, because of that advice, but I became so disillusioned and dismayed by bad practice in the industry that I eventually concluded there was no point in applying for any more jobs.

,When Tony Blair asked , to work for him in 1994, he revealed his mental health problems to the man who would be Prime Minister. 
,
""I said Tony, you know I get depression from time to time? He said, ""I'm not worried, if you're not worried."" Alastairs's experience at work is in sharp contrast to the majority who experience mental health problems. ""I thought, if the Prime Minister can take that attitude, why can't other employers?"" But in a recent survey, only four out of ten employers said they would employ someone with a history of mental illness.
,
Alastair says, ""Depression should be properly recognised as an illness and openly talked about, the same way people talk about a broken leg."" He credits his own recovery to the support of his family and friends, medical support, and, of course, getting back to work. ""I was incredibly lucky,"" he says. ""Others are not so fortunate.  Challenging stigma and changing attitudes takes time. But it happens.""
